<CAPTION>  Photo; PHOTO: NRG's new elastic cords turn athletic shoes into slip-ons  </CAPTION>
<DESCRIPT>  CONSUMER; PRODUCT; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  THE booming athletic shoe business is offering another item that can be sold
with a new pair of shoes, the innovative NRG (pronounced "energy") elastic
cord lace system.;   These bungee-cord type shoelaces help in keeping the
shoes securely on and convert a pair of athletic shoes into slip-ons. Because
the laces expand and contract, they do not bind like standard shoelaces. But
they still grant full support.  </LEADPARA>

FEET  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Consumer; The Gadget Guru  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The <ORGANIZATION>NRG</ORGANIZATION> laces are used like an ordinary pair. It is best to first lace the
shoe on your foot so it's not too tight. Then insert the two ends into the
lock and secure. Instead of having to loosen the laces and tie to put on your
shoes, you just grasp the sides and slip them on.;   <ORGANIZATION>NRG</ORGANIZATION>'s elastic cord lace
system is available now and sells for <MONEY>$7</MONEY> per pair. For more information, call
(213) 474-9377, or write: <ORGANIZATION>NRG Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, 10850 <LOCATION>Wilshire Blvd.</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Eighth Floor</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Los
Angeles</LOCATION> 90024.;   BEAT THE BACKUP -- Another noteworthy item I recently found
is Design Tech's Reverse Alert.;   This product is a combination backup light
and warning alarm for your car. The Reverse Alert's 80-decibel tone is
designed to warn others that you are backing up.;   Best of all, this product
takes less than a minute to install. Since it replaces the existing backup
light bulb, it just snaps into place. It fits all import cars and <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT>
of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> vehicles and sells for <MONEY>$30</MONEY>. For more information, call <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION> at (800)
366-3000 (item No. 28BK5920).;   WHERE THERE'S SMOKE -- There is also a new
smoke detector that is easy to install and doesn't need to have its batteries
changed.;   New from Generation Two is the G2 Smoke Detector. Just screw it
into a light socket and it gets its power from the AC current. It features a
backup battery that automatically charges when the light switch is turned on
and takes over when it is turned off or in the event of a power failure.;   A
light bulb can be inserted in the opposite end of the smoke detector, so the
fixture can still be used as a lamp. The G2 Smoke Detector is available now
and sells for <MONEY>$25</MONEY>. For more information, call <PERSON>Hammacher Schlemmer</PERSON>, (800)
543-3366 (item No. 42507H).;   PAIN IN THE DRAIN -- The next time your sink
clogs, you may want to try Jet Blast's new Drain Blaster.;   This unit uses
water pressure to unclog even the most stubborn drains. It connects to any
faucet and features a thin 8-foot hose.;   After connecting the hose to the
faucet, just slide it into the drain and turn on the water. A high-pressure
jet spray pierces through blockages while flushing debris from pipe walls.;  
When tested on a slowly draining sink, this unit performed remarkably well,
better than liquid drain openers. The Drain Blaster sells for <MONEY>$20</MONEY>. For more
information, call (800) 538-2527.  </TEXT>

<P>
Manufacturers offered a wide range of innovative products for consumers this 
year. Some are new; some old, but improved. From <DATE>1990</DATE>'s columns we've selected 
what we believe are the year's 10 best, in no particular order. See what you 
think. 
</P>

StarLace is a learning product that helps teach children (ages 4 and older) how 
to tie shoelaces. It's a colorful elastic band with ready-to-tie laces -- one 
red, one white to differentiate right from left -- that fits over the shoe and 
keeps the laces from slipping. 
</P>
<P>
Developed by a Diamond Bar consultant in child psychology, StarLace features 
stiffer than normal laces that don't droop so children can manipulate them more 
easily. 
</P>
<P>
On each lace is a positioning star, so children can begin tying laces by 
putting the stars together; then parents and youngsters can follow the 
step-by-step procedures on an illustrated, accompanying poster. Velcro-like 
strips on the inside also help the laces stay together while the child is 
learning to tie the knot. 
</P>
<P>
StarLace (suggested retail price, <MONEY>$9.95</MONEY>) is available in the children's shoe 
department at <ORGANIZATION>Nordstrom</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Glendale</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brea</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cerritos</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>South Coast Plaza</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Costa Mesa</LOCATION>. Or write to <PERSON>Dr. Deann Toys</PERSON>, <DATE>3333</DATE> Brea Canyon Road, Suite 124, 
<ORGANIZATION>Diamond Bar</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION> 91765. 
</P>
<P>
Sports fans, opera lovers or bird watchers will enjoy <ORGANIZATION>Perma Focus</ORGANIZATION> binoculars, 
with which you can see everything from 40 feet to infinity in sharp focus. And 
you don't have to adjust them manually; they focus automatically when you look 
through them. 
</P>
<P>
The secret is in their optical elements, "engineered to make use of the eye's 
natural ability to focus," according to a representative of <ORGANIZATION>Jason Empire</ORGANIZATION>, the 
<LOCATION>Overland Park</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kan.</LOCATION>, manufacturer. <ORGANIZATION>Perma Focus</ORGANIZATION> has several models with 
different magnification powers. All are lightweight, and range in price from 
<MONEY>$70</MONEY> to <MONEY>$170</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
The binoculars are sold nationwide in camera stores and chain stores, including 
<ORGANIZATION>Fedco</ORGANIZATION>, K mart, <ORGANIZATION>Montgomery Ward</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Service Merchandise</ORGANIZATION> and Target. Or, 
contact <ORGANIZATION>Jason Empire Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, 9200 Cody, Box 14930, <LOCATION>Overland Park</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kan.</LOCATION> 66214;

SuperMatch fire-starters from <ORGANIZATION>Diamond Brands</ORGANIZATION>, the Minnesota-based company that 
has been making matches since <DATE>1881</DATE>, provide a handy way to start a fireplace 
fire or barbecue without using kindling or liquid-fuel starter. 
</P>
<P>
SuperMatch is made of compressed sawdust and wax, as are some other 
fire-starters on the market. But each SuperMatch has its own match head on one 
end so you can light it on the striker surface of the matchbox like an ordinary 
safety match. Each stick will burn about 12 minutes, long enough to get a log 
fire or charcoal started. 
</P>
<P>
SuperMatches (about <MONEY>$1.59</MONEY> for a seven-match box) are available nationwide in 
supermarkets, mass merchandise outlets and drugstores. In <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>, 
they're carried by <ORGANIZATION>Vons</ORGANIZATION>, Lucky and Alpha Beta markets. For more information, 
contact <ORGANIZATION>Diamond Brands Western Regional Sales Office</ORGANIZATION>, <DATE>1820</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Orangewood Ave.</ORGANIZATION>, 
Suite 101, Orange, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION> 92668, (714) 385-1530; or <ORGANIZATION>Diamond Brands</ORGANIZATION> headquarters 
in <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>, (612) 541-1500.

<P>
Sherry's Miracle stain solution is a nontoxic, water-based stain remover for 
carpet and upholstery that also deodorizes the soiled area as it removes the 
stain. It also can be used on clothing, but should be color-fast tested first 
on an inconspicuous area of the fabric. 
</P>
<P>
This stain remover is the most effective we've seen. If used as directed, it 
takes out such tough-to-remove things as pet stains, blood, food, grass, 
iodine, coffee, tea, wine, ketchup, grease, oil stains, most shoe polish, 
crayon, latex paint, chocolate and raw egg. 
</P>
<P>
To order -- <MONEY>$10</MONEY>, plus <MONEY>$2.50</MONEY> shipping and handling for 16 ounces; <MONEY>$1.50</MONEY>, 50 
shipping, for a two-ounce trial size -- contact <PERSON>Sherry</PERSON>'s Miracle, <LOCATION>P.O.</LOCATION> Box 201,

Owners of vertical blinds can get new help with the <ORGANIZATION>Vertical Blind Attachment</ORGANIZATION> 
from <ORGANIZATION>IdeaWorks</ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION>Pacific Palisades</LOCATION> company last year introduced the <ORGANIZATION>Mini 
Blind Vac Attachment</ORGANIZATION>, which fits over a standard vacuum to clean horizontal 
mini-blinds. 
</P>
<P>
The new tool cleans vertical blinds -- two at a time -- and comes with two 
adapters to fit all major brands of standard vacuum cleaners and the Dustbuster 
Plus.

The Recycling File system provides an easy way to sort and store recyclable 
items -- paper, glass and aluminum -- at home or office. 
</P>
<P>
The file consists of three reusable vinyl storage bags hanging from a 
17-by-18-by-27-inch white PVC rack. The washable bags slide easily from the 
rack so they can be carried to curbside or a recycling center, and come in a 
choice of white, black, gray, blue or dark green. 
</P>
<P>
The system (retail, <MONEY>$50</MONEY> to <MONEY>$55</MONEY>) is available nationwide through <ORGANIZATION>Nature Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
stores and catalogue, at the <ORGANIZATION>Earth Store</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Westwood</LOCATION> and OP 266 (formerly

If you can't stand the smell of mothballs, Moth-Away is a moth-repellent made

scent; you don't have to air out your clothes for days to get rid of mothball 
odor.

Nuwick is a candle in a can that will burn about 120 hours, so it's great for 
camping, boating and other recreational uses or for emergencies. Nuwick has six 
separate, movable wicks that can be used and reused -- for light or cooking. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-ounce candle comes in a sturdy metal can that won't tip over, and it can 
be stored almost anywhere. Nuwick is made of a specially formulated, 
low-temperature paraffin that is slow burning and nontoxic. There are no smelly 
fumes, and it won't liquefy if sitting flat. 
</P>
<P>
The waterproof wicks can be moved around the top of the wax with a tweezer, 
which is included in the candle kit along with a pack of safety matches. 
</P>
<P>
Nuwick (suggested retail price, about <MONEY>$9.95</MONEY>) is available nationwide in drug, 
sporting goods and camping stores. In <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>, it's sold at Super 
Drugs in <LOCATION>Westwood</LOCATION>, the Outdoorsman in <LOCATION>Lancaster</LOCATION>, Surplus Store on <ORGANIZATION>Venice 
Boulevard</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Gerald</PERSON>'s Hardware in <LOCATION>Westchester</LOCATION> and 14 REI 
(<ORGANIZATION>Recreational Equipment Inc.</ORGANIZATION>) stores. If you can't find the candle in your

</P>
<P>
A <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> doctor has invented Handaids, disposable lightweight plastic gloves 
filled with moisturizing cream that help soothe chapped hands and heal split 
cuticles. 
</P>
<P>
The soft gloves mold to your hands and act like a mini-sauna, holding in body 
heat and allowing the pores of the skin to absorb the lotion, which is made of 
petroleum, aloe and vitamins A and E. Because there's no lotion outside the 
gloves, they are not messy; you can read a paper or book while moisturizing you 
hands or even wear them to bed. 
</P>
<P>
To order Handaids (<MONEY>$8.95</MONEY>, plus <MONEY>$2.50</MONEY> for postage and handling for a box of 
seven pairs; 21 pairs for <MONEY>$26</MONEY>, plus <MONEY>$3.50</MONEY> shipping and handling), send a check 
or money order to <ORGANIZATION>O &amp; L Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>P.O. Box 1227</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Bristol</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION> 19007; (215) 
785-2220. 
</P>
<P>
Canadian inventor <PERSON>Norman Rolston</PERSON> has developed Able Walker to help give 
mobility to senior citizens and others who need assistance in walking. The 
chrome, lightweight (15 pounds) Able <PERSON>Walker</PERSON> is not only a walking aid, but also 
a grocery cart or a seat that can hold up to 500 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Walker height is adjustable -- it can be used by a 4-foot, 10-inch child or a 
6-foot, 6-inch adult. It is fitted with handlebars covered with foam grips, 
four wheels, hand brakes and the shopping basket that converts to a seat. 
Locking buttons on the handlebars will keep it stationary when you want to sit. 
The walker also can be turned into a luggage cart by removing the basket and 
turning a hinge at the bottom of the walker. 
</P>
<P>
Able Walker (<MONEY>$299</MONEY>, including shipping and handling) basically comes in one 
piece; all you do is attach the brakes. To order, contact <ORGANIZATION>Able Walker Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, 
<LOCATION>Bldg</LOCATION>. C-2, <DATE>1122</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Fir Ave.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Blaine</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>, 98230; (800) 663-1305.

FLATS FEATURED IN FABRICS, PATENT LEATHER AND METALLICS

<P>
American women are in the midst of a flats attack. Just ask <PERSON>Libby Edelman</PERSON>, 
designer and co-owner of <ORGANIZATION>Sam &amp; Libby</ORGANIZATION> shoes in <LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION>, who 
accords top billing to her company's leather ballerina slipper. 
</P>
<P>
At <LOCATION>Nina</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, fashion director <PERSON>Flori Silverstein</PERSON> likens her firm's big 
hit, a wedge-heel, patent-leather skimmer (2 million pairs sold in two years), 
to a classic T-shirt. And <PERSON>Miriam Sirota</PERSON>, the trendy co-owner of Privilege shoe 
stores in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, insists "flats have become a basic." 
</P>
<P>
She's seen the most avid high-heel wearers make the switch this <DATE>spring</DATE>, 
inspired perhaps by <PERSON>Sirota</PERSON>'s firm belief: "Flats don't mean unflattering." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes they don't mean expensive either. This year the hot contender is 
expressive, fabric footwear that retails for <MONEY>$50</MONEY> or less. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Sirota</PERSON> says she and partner <PERSON>Thierry Coulon</PERSON> carefully chose three cloth designs 
from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, all priced around <MONEY>$50</MONEY>, to sell along with much more expensive 
merchandise. While she thinks of them as "fun, one-season throwaway shoes," she 
says they don't have to be. 
</P>
<P>
"It all depends on how much a woman wears them. If she buys one pair to go with 
three or four outfits and wears them once a week, they can last longer." 
</P>
<P>
Details such as a slight, wedge-heel on a pair of fuchsia, purple and black 
Shantung ballerina slippers at Privilege "make it just a little bit easier to 
walk in than a flat flat," <PERSON>Sirota</PERSON> notes. "They sell well because they give the 
comfort and allure of a flat, but they give you height as well." 
</P>
<P>
Measuring in at 5-foot-1, <PERSON>Sirota</PERSON> scoffs at the notion that petite women need 
high heels. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in flats every day. I'm short and it doesn't bother me even if I go 
somewhere where I'm the shortest person in the room." Describing her personal 
style as "very, very trendy," <PERSON>Sirota</PERSON> believes that some of today's fashions, 
"<LOCATION>Bermuda</LOCATION> shorts, miniskirts and long, wide pants are totally unfit for high 
heels." 
</P>
<P>
Nina's <PERSON>Silverstein</PERSON> has her own answers to why more and more women are getting 
into low-heel shoes: "Life is getting faster and we have to move faster." 
</P>
<P>
One of her company's most popular styles is a <MONEY>$39</MONEY>, go-anywhere mule (a slip-on 
shoe open at the toe and heel) that comes in bright-colored patent leather or 
metallics. It is considered to have longevity despite the price. 
</P>
<P>
"They need care," <PERSON>Silverstein</PERSON> says, suggesting that patent be wiped with a damp 
cloth. She says cloth designs, such as pastel and print-mix espadrilles, "can 
be spot-cleaned with a little soap and water and a toothbrush, but the joy of 
most fabric shoes is not to have to spend a lot of money for them and not to 
worry about them." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Silverstein</PERSON>'s tricks for fabric footwear include adding an emblem or an 
inexpensive Chanel-look pin where you might expect to see a bow. "Or you can 
paint them or change the ribbons. And if worst comes to worst, you can buy a 
little package of dye and dye them black." 
</P>
<P>
Fun and quality at a price are two reasons "fabric shoes are back," she says. 
"Who wants to spend <MONEY>$100</MONEY> for polka-dot leather pumps when you can have polka 
dots for <MONEY>$35</MONEY> and throw them out at the end of the <DATE>summer</DATE>." 
</P>
<P>
For designer <PERSON>Edelman</PERSON>, this year's challenge was "to get people out of <DATE>last 
summer</DATE>'s sneakers. We thought they would be ready for a change." She designed 
canvas shoes in solids, stripes or dots and added a crest as well as a leather 
sole. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Lillian Navarro</PERSON>, shoe designer for Chinese Laundry, sees both stripes and 
European-inspired suede <DATE>summer</DATE> shoes, with slightly pointed toes and high 
vamps, as "wardrobe necessities." 
</P>
<P>
To get women's feet closer to the ground, designers such as <PERSON>Navarro</PERSON> are adding 
clever ornamentations to flats that suggest "the dressy look of high heels," 
she says.

TONGUE TIED: NEW CHARGER PUNTER GETS IN BIND OVER SHOELACES

<P>
<PERSON>Hank Ilesic</PERSON> hadn't even wiped all the shaving cream off his face <DATE>Sunday</DATE> before 
a bunch of reporters wanted to know what all this fuss was about his right 
shoe. 
</P>
<P>
Ilesic was called in by the Chargers from <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> <DATE>last week</DATE> to take over the 
punting duties from <PERSON>Lewis Colbert</PERSON>, who had a dismal 33.3-yard average in the 
first two games. Ilesic, a 13-year veteran of the <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Football League</ORGANIZATION>, has 
been in town only long enough to figure out it's a good deal warmer here than 
in <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>, where he averaged 44.0 yards a punt last season with the Argonauts. 
</P>
<P>
So he has been practicing his punting with this funny-sized American football 
for a few days. He was all set to give it a go against the <LOCATION>Kansas City Chiefs</LOCATION> 
before 40,128 spectators at <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> <PERSON>Jack Murphy</PERSON> Stadium when, just a few 
minutes before kickoff, Chief Coach <PERSON>Marty Schottenheimer</PERSON> beckoned the 
officiating crew and informed them that <ORGANIZATION>Ilesic</ORGANIZATION>'s shoe was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Huh? 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, it seems this brand of shoe has a leather tongue that covers the laces. 
One of the officials ended up on the phone to <PERSON>Art McNally</PERSON>, supervisor of 
officials for the <ORGANIZATION>National Football League</ORGANIZATION>, and asked him if it was OK for 
Ilesic to kick. McNally's answer was something to the effect of: "Not unless 
the laces are showing." 
</P>
<P>
Well, <PERSON>Sid Brooks</PERSON>, the Charger equipment manager, solved the problem easily 
enough, cutting away enough leather so the laces were exposed. Ilesic kicked. 
The Chargers defeated the <LOCATION>Chiefs</LOCATION>, 21-6. And everything was dandy. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Ilesic really couldn't understand what all the commotion was about. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no big deal," he said. "We have a game to play. If you're upset about it, 
it's going to affect your performance." 
</P>
<P>
It seems that when Charger Coach <PERSON>Dan Henning</PERSON> told Ilesic he couldn't use the 
shoe as is, Ilesic shrugged, put on the makeshift version and punted five times 
for an average of 44.8 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"It probably disturbed me a lot more than it did <PERSON>Hank</PERSON>," said <PERSON>Henning</PERSON>, who made 
the announcement about the shoe problem as if he was breaking the biggest news 
since the <PERSON>Jim McMahon</PERSON> trade. Yet <PERSON>Henning</PERSON> also gave his new punter a vote of 
confidence, saying: "Under the conditions I think he had a pretty good day." 
</P>
<P>
Remember, this guy Ilesic has been around for a few years. His punting career 
in the <ORGANIZATION>CFL</ORGANIZATION> survived 13 seasons and 1,573 kicks. So it was no surprise to <PERSON>Joe 
Madden</PERSON>, the Charger special teams coach, that he was able to jump into this 
strange shoe and do the job. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a professional," <PERSON>Madden</PERSON> said. "He'll improve on that, I promise." 
</P>
<P>
Which is saying a lot, considering Ilesic gave the fans their first opportunity 
this season to applaud a punt. That happened midway through the <DATE>second quarter</DATE> 
when he sent Chief returner <PERSON>Naz Worthen</PERSON> retreating at a sprinter's pace for a 
ball that traveled 60 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The next episode of the "<PERSON>Hank</PERSON>'s Punting Shoe" will begin today, when <PERSON>Brooks</PERSON> 
stuffs the thing in a <ORGANIZATION>Federal Express</ORGANIZATION> package and sends it to the league office 
with a photo of an American-made shoe that looks just like it. Brooks isn't 
convinced there's anything wrong with <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s version. 
</P>
<P>
"They said the shoe was made in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>," said <PERSON>Brooks</PERSON> of the protest. "I said, 
'Yeah, rain shoes are made in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, too, and we use them.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ilesic doesn't plan to spend a lot of time worrying about the whole thing. He's 
taking an attitude of, "Hey, if the shoe fits, wear it." To him, the <ORGANIZATION>Chiefs</ORGANIZATION>' 
ploy was all just part of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure," he said. "The new kid on the street. If you can distract the opposition 
in any way, try it." 
</P>
<P>
If not distracted, Ilesic certainly noted a few differences punting in an <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> 
game than in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is so much quicker here," he said. "The incoming rush, the punt 
returners. You have to get the ball off a lot quicker." 
</P>
<P>
Ilesic says he has waited for this opportunity for years and plans to make the 
most of it. He says he doesn't know a whole lot about the Chargers or their 
history, and he hasn't seen much more of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> than the stadium and his 
hotel. But he has a good feeling about this place. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel like a stranger, an outsider," he said. "In due time, I'll settle 
down and get accustomed to the surroundings." 
</P>
<P>
It's bound to get easier than the first game. Then again, he may not get this 
much attention again for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing like breaking into the league with some controversy," he said.

<HL> Not Every Trip Is a Tort

<TEXT>
   I used to blame lawyers for the excesses I observed in the use of lawsuits to resolve social problems. 
I still do, to an extent. 
But if lawyers began this mad race to the courthouse, the lawsuit is now officially public property. 
Although I'm a lawyer and a law professor, I discovered all of this not through legal research, nor by observation of law reform movements, nor even from my involvement in alternative dispute resolution. 
I learned this by falling down in the <LOCATION>Miami Airport</LOCATION> last year. 

   I was running for a plane, with a bag in each hand, when the lace of one of my high-top sneakers became untied. 
With the left foot, I stepped on the lace of the right shoe. 
The right foot, being thus restricted, failed to respond when my leg moved forward. 
My body, impelled by the speed of my stride and the forward thrust of my bags, did not react to the inability of my right foot to maintain my upright stance. 
In other words, I fell down. 

   I landed hard on my right knee, and while the skin over my kneecap was rearranged by the concrete and there was some blood, I can't say I've been permanently disabled. 
What startled me most was not the fall, nor the resulting pain, but the reaction of bystanders. 
Once they had ascertained that I didn't need medical assistance, their next thought was that I should sue. 

   "I saw it," one solicitous lady said to me. 
"I'll give you my name and address. 
I'm a witness!" 
The security guard was summoned and would not let me on the plane until I filed an accident report. 
They brought me a wheelchair. 
They even held the plane for me. 
The profound response of all around me was unmistakable. 
A lawsuit had been born. 

   No one had noticed that I'd tripped on my shoelace, and when I told them, they reacted as if I had said something incredibly stupid. 
Fault didn't matter one whit to those who understood, without the benefit of law-school educations, that a deep pocket loomed large on the horizon. 

   When I returned to school, limping, and explained what had occurred, my students joined the chorus of those urging me to go to court. 
"Sue the shoe manufacturer! 
Sue the worker who poured the concrete!" they suggested, with visions of strict liability dancing in their brains. 
They live in a world of exploding pop bottles and faulty flywheels, so they can be forgiven. 
But the people in the <LOCATION>Miami Airport</LOCATION> aren't law students, and yet they were similarly preoccupied with the potential for recovery. 
They had read of wrongs righted for a few million and change. 
The dollars danced in their brains, too. 

   I am not unaware of the good that lawsuits have accomplished. 
But some suits are clearly ridiculous. 
Children shouldn't sue when there's no prize in the <LOCATION>Crackerjacks</LOCATION> -- as one little girl did. 
There are some things that the law simply cannot fix -- or should not be asked to fix. 
We have come so far from personal responsibility that the court becomes our mother, to whom we turn in response to every injury, no matter how innocent others are in our misfortune, no matter how much our own actions explain the result. 

   Many lawsuits result from the sense of anomie that we suffer at the hands of an uncaring world. 
I firmly believe that we could reduce the number of suits by the simple expedient of creating a "public sympathizer." 
Everyone who has suffered an injustice could visit the public sympathizer, who would commiserate and say: "You've been hurt. 
You've been wronged. 
I will post your name on the courthouse door as one who has suffered." 

   I teach my law students to listen and to counsel. 
I teach them to care about their clients. 
I teach them rules of law and hope to instill in them a sense of purpose that is grander than the bottom line. 
I teach them that lawsuits have costs far beyond the legal fees that rack up on both sides. 
But I don't know how to teach them that our complex and competitive society requires of them, and of the legal system, much more than can ever be delivered. 

   Lawyers are doomed to failure when we attempt, whatever our motives, to right every personal wrong. 
It is this failure that leads, I believe, to criticism of lawyers. 

   I came away from the <LOCATION>Miami Airport</LOCATION> with two injuries. 
The one to my knee has healed. 
But I wonder when the injury I suffered -- and which our society suffers as a result of the deterioration of the concept of personal responsibility -- will ever be healed. 
I don't believe that I can fix this injury, and I don't believe the courts can solve it either. 
Perhaps my primary obligation as a lawyer is to understand it, and to expend my best efforts not to make it any worse.

FT  22 JAN 92 / FT Law Report: Jersey company must pay liquidator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RE SHOE <ORGANIZATION>LACE LTD Chancery Division</ORGANIZATION>: <PERSON>Mr Justice Hoffmann</PERSON>: <DATE>December 20 1992</DATE>
A DEBENTURE creating an all-monies floating charge, executed by a company
two months before presentation of an insolvency petition in consideration of
advances already made to it by its parent in anticipation of the debenture,
is invalid in that the charge was not created before or 'at the same time
as' the payments were made, having regard to the ordinary meaning of those
words in a commercial and regulatory context.
<PERSON>Mr Justice Hoffmann</PERSON> so held when granting an application under RSC Order 29
rule 10 by <PERSON>Mr Dermot Justin Power</PERSON>, liquidator of <ORGANIZATION>Shoe Lace Ltd</ORGANIZATION>, for an
interim payment in respect of his claim for return of company funds paid to
the first respondent, <ORGANIZATION>Sharp Investments Ltd</ORGANIZATION>, a company allegedly controlled
by the second respondent, <PERSON>Mr Chandru Mahtani</PERSON>.
Section 245 of the Insolvency Act <DATE>1986</DATE> provides: '(2) . . . a floating
charge on the company's undertaking or property created at the relevant time
is invalid except to the extent of . . . (a) the value . . . of the
consideration for the creation of the charge . . . paid . . . to the company
at the same time as, or after the creation of the charge . . .
(3) . . . the time . . . is a relevant time . . . if the charge is created -
(a) . . . in favour of a person who is connected with the company . . .
within . . . two years ending with the onset of insolvency . . .'
HIS LORDSHIP said Sharp was a Jersey company which held 80 per cent of <ORGANIZATION>Shoe
Lace</ORGANIZATION>'s issued share capital. <PERSON>Mr Mahtani</PERSON> was a business man who lived in
<LOCATION>Ratigen</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>. He was alleged to control Sharp through a Jersey trust,
and to have acted as a shadow director of <ORGANIZATION>Shoe Lace</ORGANIZATION>.
Shoe Lace operated a number of shops in <LOCATION>Lancashire</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> which sold
cheap footwear.
The original directors were <PERSON>Mr Sam Nolan</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Jersey</LOCATION> accountant who was also a
director of Sharp, and <PERSON>Mr Barry Fox</PERSON> who was alloted 20 per cent of the share
capital.
A copy of an accountant's report commissioned by <PERSON>Mr Nolan</PERSON> in <DATE>August 1990</DATE>
showed that Shoe Lace was hopelessly insolvent in <DATE>April 1990</DATE> and that its
position became steadily worse.
Minutes of directors' meetings showed that in <DATE>February 1990</DATE> Shoe Lace had
exhausted its banking facilities and decided to apply to its parent company,
Sharp, for support.
On <DATE>March 20</DATE> the directors resolved to grant Sharp a debenture to secure past
and future advances, in consideration of further short-term finance.
According to the evidence of Sharp's solicitor, it advanced Pounds 300,000
to <ORGANIZATION>Shoe Lace</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>April 3</DATE>, Pounds 50,000 in <DATE>May</DATE>, Pounds 75,000 in <DATE>June</DATE>, and a
final payment of Pounds 11,500 on <DATE>July 16</DATE>.
The debenture was not executed until <DATE>July 24</DATE>.
It created a charge to secure the payment of 'all monies . . . hereby
covenanted to be paid'. The document contained no covenant to pay anything,
but the registered particulars described it as an all-monies charge and the
court would assume that it could be rectified to correspond with that
description.
There was a fixed charge over immoveable assets and goodwill, and a floating
charge over the whole of the assets and undertaking.
A petition for compulsory winding-up was presented on <DATE>September 4</DATE> and served
at the trading address the same day. It was served at the registered office
on <DATE>September 11</DATE>.
On <DATE>September 13</DATE> Shoe Lace entered into a sale of business agreement by which
it sold all its assets to a company called <ORGANIZATION>Shoe Hut Ltd</ORGANIZATION>, another <LOCATION>Channel
Island</LOCATION> company, for Pounds 211,000.
By direction of <ORGANIZATION>Shoe Lace</ORGANIZATION>, Pounds 180,710 of the purchase price was paid by
Shoe Hut direct to Sharp as debenture-holder. The rest was retained against
the outcome of a claim of retained title to stock made by a supplier.
Shoe Lace was compulsorily wound up on <DATE>November 20</DATE>. The Pounds 180,710 was
frozen in Sharp's bank account by court order on <DATE>February 15 1991</DATE>.
The liquidator said Sharp was not entitled to that money. He said that
Sharp, <LOCATION>Shoe Lace</LOCATION> and Shoe Hut were all controlled by <PERSON>Mr Mahtani</PERSON>.
There was a high probability that Shoe Hut was a phoenix company, but the
present court did not need to decide the question, because the principal
ground on which the liquidator founded his application was that the floating
charge created by the debenture was invalidated by section 245 of the
Insolvency Act <DATE>1986</DATE>.
Section 245 provided that a floating charge created within two years before
the onset of insolvency in favour of a person connected with the company,
was invalid, except to the extent of consideration paid for creation of the
charge 'at the same time as, or after, the creation of the charge'.
By subsection (5) the onset of insolvency was the date of presentation of
the petition.
The floating charge was created within two months before the onset of
insolvency. Also, Sharp controlled Shoe Lace and so was a connected person.
The charge was therefore void except to the extent that Sharp paid money to
Shoe Lace 'at the same time as, or after, the creation of the charge'.
There was no authority on the meaning of 'at the same time as' in section
245.
The degree of contemporaneity which such words connoted must depend on the
context.
It might not be unreasonable to say that two species of dinosaur became
extinct 'at the same time' when millions of years separated their last known
representatives. On the other hand, one would not say the winner of a race
crossed the tape at the same time as the runner-up, though separated by less
than a tenth of second.
In section 245 the context was commercial and regulatory.
For example, it formed part of a scheme which included the requirement that
particulars of a floating charge must be delivered to the <ORGANIZATION>Registrar of
Companies</ORGANIZATION> within 21 days of its creation.
The question was whether a businessman having knowledge of the kind of time
limits imposed by the Insolvency and Companies Acts, and using ordinary
language, would say that the payments had been made at the same time as
execution of the debenture.
No businessman would use such language of the payments made in the present
case.
He would say that the parties had agreed in <DATE>March</DATE> that a debenture should be
granted, that a number of payments were made in consideration of that
promise, but that they did not get around to executing the debenture until
afterwards.
The respondents' solicitor said it was not executed because <PERSON>Mr Nolan</PERSON> was
dilatory. He thought that as <ORGANIZATION>Shoe Lace</ORGANIZATION> had agreed to grant the debenture
there was no urgency about execution.
The court was referred to authorities on earlier sections invalidating
floating charges, which resembled section 245. None was binding because the
language of the current section was different.
No principle was derived from them for present purposes except that stated
by the <ORGANIZATION>Court of Appeal</ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION>Columbian Fireproofing</ORGANIZATION> (<DATE>1910</DATE>) 1 Ch 758, that
contemporaneity was a question of fact. In section 245 the words 'at the
same time as' only emphasised that contemporaneity was an objective matter.
If that was wrong and it was necessary to look at the reasons for the delay,
it seemed that Sharp, through <PERSON>Mr Nolan</PERSON>, acquiesced in the delay of <ORGANIZATION>Shoe
Lace</ORGANIZATION>, through <PERSON>Mr Nolan</PERSON>, in executing the debenture.
To obtain an interim payment under RSC Order 29 rule 10, the liquidator must
show a case of such strength as would justify judgment under RSC Order 14.
That was subject to Order 14A, which enabled the court to decide a question
of law if it appeared suitable for determination without full trial and if
such determination would finally dispose of an issue in the cause.
Construction of section 245 could be decided without full trial of the
liquidator's summons, and the determination would finally dispose of the
question of validity of the floating charge, because it meant that even on
the respondents' own evidence, the charge must be invalid.
Of the Pounds 180,710 paid under the sale agreement, Pounds 41,000 was
allocated to immoveable property and Pounds 5,000 to goodwill. Both were
subject to fixed charges which, although possibly voidable on other grounds,
did not fall within section 245.
That meant that for the purposes of an interim payment, it would be just to
order that Pounds 134,710 be paid out of the frozen funds to the liquidator.
For the liquidator: <PERSON>Daniel Serota</PERSON> QC and <PERSON>Paul Lowenstein</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Fruhman, Davies &amp;
Co</ORGANIZATION>).
For the respondents: <PERSON>John Briggs</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>McKenna &amp; Co</ORGANIZATION>).

FT  09 APR 94 / How To Spend It: The combat boot goes in - Chunky footwear
is in vogue. Lucia van der Post looks at one purveyor of sensible shoes that
finds itself suddenly chic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once it was just the young who clumped around in <PERSON>Doc Martens</PERSON> while their
elders tended to look on and wonder why they could not trip about in
something a little daintier. These days, however, clumpy shoes are
everywhere. I even found myself scouring <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> for a pair of heavy lace-up
<PERSON>Ann Demeulemeester</PERSON> shoes (found eventually - at a price - at Jones in Floral
Street in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s Covent Garden); everything else seemed too timid, too
demure to set off a new suit I had bought.
The fashion pages show that the skinniest, most fine-boned of models prefer
combat boots or heavy trainers. Every fashionable foot is wearing the
walking shoe, the army boot or the sturdy lace-up. There may be some among
you who think that dainty lady-like shoes should be worn with floating
chiffons - I urge you to try a sturdier shoe (or even boot) and see how it
gives a fresher, more youthful look, how it adds a touch of wit and
modernity to what could otherwise verge on cutesey sweetness.
An unlikely provider of this look is <PERSON>Hawkins</PERSON>, a traditional footwear company
which bears a <ORGANIZATION>Royal Warrant</ORGANIZATION> and which provided hard-wearing and comfortable
riding boots to the army during the Boer War.
For years <PERSON>Hawkins</PERSON> has been a solid provider of footwear for riding, for
walking, for the army. Its reputation was founded on function, quality and
practicality.
Fashion, however, has caught up with <PERSON>Hawkins</PERSON> which, to its astonishment
found that its Kinderboot, which it had perceived as a functional low-budget
walking boot, was nearly as fashionable as <PERSON>Doc Martens</PERSON>. Featured in The
Face, Arena and other trend-setting journals it was to be seen tromping up
and down the chicest streets, worn with everything from jeans and cotton
chinos to evening dress and floaty chiffons.
Since it had found itself so unexpectedly in the fashion arena <PERSON>Hawkins</PERSON>
decided that it might as well build on that and developed a fashion
collection of its own which it launches next <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
As fashionable footwear this year coincides so closely with the things that
<PERSON>Hawkins</PERSON> does best - the boot, the lace-up, the brogue - the collection is
well-timed. Prices, though not cheap, do seem good value. They vary between
Pounds 39.99 and Pounds 89.99. Hiking boots can be had for Pounds 52.50, the
famous Kinderboot for about Pounds 55.
The collection is available nationwide at <LOCATION>Sacha</LOCATION> branches as well as at many
other shoe shops. For a local stockist you could call 0604-32293.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: If the shoe fits . . . - Peter Cave
casts a satirical eye on the Financial Services Act
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER CAVE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the passing of the FSA (Footwear Services Act), shoe wearers and their
feet are protected from the unscrupulous salesperson. Witness the care and
diligence displayed by the footwear adviser.
Client: I'd like to try on that pair of shoes.
Footwear Adviser: If I may say so, madam, before we investigate that
particular pair, we must establish your foot-wearing circumstances and
objectives; after all, it might be that you need cycling shoes or wellington
boots or silver slippers or . . .
C: Sorry, I haven't time for all that. Those should fit the bill or rather,
my feet.
FA: We must take nothing for granted, madam. After all, you wouldn't thank
me for selling you slippers if you needed mountaineering boots.
C: True, but I know what I want.
FA: But do you know what you need? Do you need what you want? Our duty is to
your needs.
C: Okay, I need those shoes . . .
<ORGANIZATION>FA</ORGANIZATION>: Standing before madam is an experienced professional adviser - yet madam
prefers madam's amateur hunch? Has madam passed the Footwear Advisers'
Competency Test?
C: Isn't that simply multiple choice - with questions such as where should
shoes be put on? Hands, mosque, bathtub, feet?
FA: Now, now - life under the sole of the <ORGANIZATION>FSA</ORGANIZATION> is to madam's advantage. No
more pre-FSA days of blisters and bunions - of which-shod businessmen and .
. .
C: Please, can't I just buy those shoes?
FA: I could accept the order as execution-only; but my head's on the line -
or, rather, under the boot. I'm allowed only one a year, but if you insist .
. .
C: Excellent - I'll try one on. One's in the window.
FA: Oops, sorry] By displaying it, we're already advising you, so
execution-only is impossible. Mind you, it's a left shoe in the window; I
could let you have the right one execution-only.
C: But not the left?
FA: No, we'd need a fact-find on your left foot. It will be difficult to
leave the right one execution-only.
C: You win] Let's answer your questionnaire - it can't take long.
FA: Indeed not; we'll have our next meeting in three weeks, when your
personalised footwear report is ready.
C: You mean I can't buy the shoes today?
FA: Think of the complexities - of insteps, style, fashion statements,
laces. What appears right to you might not really be right for you.
C: But why do you need to know about my other shoes and dresses and the
colour of my underwear - and about my carpets?
FA: Footwear affects, and is affected by, all manner of things. Does it
match your clothing, even when you're undressing? Might stilettos damage
your floors?
C: I see . . .
A thousand-and-one weary sighs later, the client stumbles into the street;
she is barefooted. It looks as if she needs shoes, but conclusions must not
be drawn hastily.
Three weeks later, the adviser is explaining his lengthy report . . .
<ORGANIZATION>FA</ORGANIZATION>: So, we've projected from your current needs, ensuring you are well
foot-clad throughout life.
C: But I came in just for a pair of shoes - not for a lifetime of laces.
Where are the shoes I first saw?
FA: Unavailable, madam. They were in a sale.
C: But they're the ones I . . .
<ORGANIZATION>FA</ORGANIZATION>: Ah, you were going to use that naughty 'want' word again, weren't you.
Look, here's a pair recommended for you.
C: They're not shaped in the way I . . .
<ORGANIZATION>FA</ORGANIZATION>: Beware the 'W' word, madam.
C: I mean - their shape fails to satisfy the needs of my desires and they're
far too expensive.
FA: Come, come madam, do not be fooled by price. Prize your feet, not the
cost. You'll also need the winter-wear recommendations on page 18. Your
children must have . . .
C: But this will cost thousands. I don't like this pair.
FA: See how well these shoes are projected to perform for the next 20 years.
C: For so long? Perhaps they are worth buying.
FA: Mind you, the projections are mythical with assumptions about pavements
walked and . . .
C: Still, they must give some idea of what I'd be getting for my money.
FA: Not quite, madam. The illustrations are not based on these shoes and
costs; they derive from an average abstract shoe, unworn by mortals.
C: But it says here that the past is no guide to the future, so why are we
discussing any of this? Why were you asking me about past walking habits? If
the past's no guide, it's all irrelevant.
FA: Ah, the <ORGANIZATION>FSA</ORGANIZATION> regulatory bodies say . . .
C: I've heard enough. I'm going]
FA: But this form needs completion with your friends' names - purely because
you might walk out together.
Regrettably the client failed to recognise the adviser's professionalism.
But not all was lost for the shoe company.
The next day, she saw a newspaper offer for the desired shoes. Different <ORGANIZATION>FSA</ORGANIZATION>
advertising rules permitted her to buy the shoes right off the page.
Unable to check the fit, she was lucky; they felt just right. Tragically,
she remains blind to her needs; she merely got what she wanted.

<HEAD>Bass Bolstered Future Prospects by Going Back to Basics</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   When <ORGANIZATION>G.H. Bass &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s former corporate parent
finally found a buyer for its shoe manufacturer in <DATE>1987</DATE>, prospects
for Bass looked so bleak that the new owner got a bargain.
   Today, the 113-year-old Bass is winning back a following after
rescuing its reputation for quality and updating its traditional
styles.
   Bass was on the block when the British-Dutch consumer products
giant <ORGANIZATION>Unilever</ORGANIZATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION>Chesebrough-Pond's Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which had owned
Bass since <DATE>1978</DATE>.
   No eager buyers rushed forward because the American footwear
industry was being crushed by foreign competition and Bass looked
like it lacked the market toehold to wage a successful fight.
   ``Bass had done nothing but struggle from <DATE>1983</DATE> to <DATE>1987</DATE>,'' says
<PERSON>John Thorbeck</PERSON>, the current Bass president. ``During this time, Bass
was a prominent example of how a domestic manufacturer was under
great pressure, and at the same time was dealing with its own
misdirection and mismanagement.''
   American shoe manufacturers in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE> had to adjust to
radically changing American tastes in shoes while coping with an
influx of imports.
   Orderly marketing agreements with <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>
controlling <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> imports of non-rubber footwear _ meaning virtually
all types of shoes _ were allowed to expire under the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>
administration. At the time, the two countries were major foreign
suppliers of everything from tennis sneakers to dressy pumps.
   Imports surged. By <DATE>1986</DATE>, imported leather and plastic shoes had
expanded to about 1 billion pairs from 520 million in <DATE>1981</DATE>, said
<PERSON>Peter T. Mangione</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Footwear Distributors and
Retailers of America</ORGANIZATION>.
   The supply went to satisfy a burgeoning demand for athletic
shoes; the jogging craze evolved into the aerobics fad, both of
which were part of a bigger fitness movement that has influenced
consumers' shoe selections ever since.
   ``The driving factor in the footwear market in this country is
fashion and the athletic trend drove this market for the <DATE>last
decade</DATE>,'' says <PERSON>Mangione</PERSON>.
   In such an environment, a company like Bass known for
conservative, sturdy leather lace-ups and loafers wasn't where it
was at.
   ``Nobody was crazy about traditional Bass Weejuns,'' <PERSON>Thorbeck</PERSON>
says of the shoe, named for its Norwegian inspiration, that debuted
in <DATE>1936</DATE>. ``These were the years when <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION> were becoming
billion-dollar companies. The casual shoes were being swept aside
by the <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION> hurricanes.''
   During those troubling years for Bass, which had been a private,
family-owned business for most of its history, the firm branched
out in directions that turned out to be the wrong ones.
   It introduced <ORGANIZATION>Bass Air</ORGANIZATION>, a line of athletic shoes that flopped.
It imported a line of women's shoes from <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and the quality was
so poor that every retailer returned its shipments to Bass. It
neglected to advertise or place marketing emphasis on its hand-sewn
leather moccasins and other shoes. With cost-cutting in mind, it
allowed quality to slip.
   Most of Bass's <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> factories were shuttered, leaving only one
in <LOCATION>Wilton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, and one in <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>. The company lost <MONEY>$46
million</MONEY> on sales of <MONEY>$150 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   The next year <ORGANIZATION>Phillips-Van Heusen Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, famous for making and
marketing women's and men's apparel, particularly shirts, bought
<LOCATION>Falmouth</LOCATION>, Maine-based Bass for <MONEY>$79 million</MONEY>, well under its book
value of <MONEY>$130 million</MONEY>.
   Thorbeck, formerly with shoe company <ORGANIZATION>Timberland Co.</ORGANIZATION>, says when
he was brought in by <PERSON>Phillips-Van Heusen</PERSON> in <DATE>November 1987</DATE> he felt
Bass needed to reassert its identity after mistakenly ignoring its
own strengths for too long.
   Bass decided to win back affluent consumers, those willing to
pay around <MONEY>$100</MONEY> for a pair of loafers. It took a targeted
advertising approach and placed 12-page promotional pitches in the
upscale magazines <LOCATION>Vogue</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>GQ</ORGANIZATION>.
   Some early successes under the new ownership helped restore the
company's confidence. Contemporary versions of some of Bass's old
favorites appealed to retailers, who probably were looking for shoe
lines to satisfy nostalgia-mad grown-up baby boomers. Saddle shoes
and buckskins were enjoying renewed popularity within some yuppie
circles
   ``In one season we proved ourselves as traditional yet
contemporary,'' says <PERSON>Thorbeck</PERSON>. ``We were hitting on all cylinders
by the <DATE>fall of 1988</DATE>.''
   Some of Bass's recent updating touches have proved timely. The
company capitalized on the demand for so-called status sneakers
this <DATE>spring</DATE> by bringing out a version of the canvas, rubber-soled
shoe swith brass eyelets, leather-padded trim and leather laces.
Instead of selling a projected 30,000 pairs in the first year, <ORGANIZATION>Bass</ORGANIZATION>
now thinks it will sell 400,000 pairs.
   Bass has concentrated on a relatively small selection of
retailers, including department stores <ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdale</ORGANIZATION>'s, <ORGANIZATION>Marshall
Field</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Nordstrom</ORGANIZATION>.
   It doesn't sell to discounters at all and controls the markdowns
on its merchandise by offering reduced-price shoes at outlets.
These Bass-owned stores are carefully located in areas with
numerous factory outlets that attract bargain-hunting tourists.
   Bass has returned to profitability. It earned <MONEY>$16 million</MONEY> in
<DATE>1988</DATE> on sales of <MONEY>$180 million</MONEY> and expects to report significantly
better results for <DATE>1989</DATE>.
   A Bass catalog has been brought out, with clothing to complement
the shoes.
   Thorbeck says he's pleased with the prominence retailers are
giving Bass in their shoe departments.
   Phillips-Van <PERSON>Heusen</PERSON> has given Bass management leeway to develop
its own strategy.
   ``One of the advantages of a company that was in this poor shape
was we could sweep through changes without much hesitation,'' says
<PERSON>Thorbeck</PERSON>. ``We went back to what we knew best and we reinterpreted
it for a contemporary customer.''

<TEXT>
   Sparks fly while <PERSON>Reggie Kester</PERSON> hammers a
length of red-hot iron just out of the forge, and gradually the
metal takes the shape of a horseshoe.
   Kester works in much the same way as craftsmen have for hundreds
of years, using forge, anvil and hammer. His rough hands speak of
the 30-odd years he has spent in the trade.
   But this isn't the village smithy. <PERSON>Kester</PERSON> and his wife,
<PERSON>Marcella</PERSON>, run the <ORGANIZATION>Oklahoma State Horseshoeing School</ORGANIZATION>, where they
teach the craft of the farrier, not blacksmithing.
   People hoping to enter what can be a lucrative trade come to the
school from around the world.
   ``I know guys that are making <MONEY>$150,000</MONEY> shoeing horses,'' <PERSON>Kester</PERSON>
says. But he admits most make between <MONEY>$20,000</MONEY> and <MONEY>$40,000</MONEY> a year.
   They've have had students from <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>. The six-week course costs
<MONEY>$2,450</MONEY> and is offered six times a year.
   Kester credits trade advertising and word-of-mouth for the
school's wide appeal. All kinds sign up for the Kesters' courses.
   ``Most of the people we have are people who have experience with
horses,'' <PERSON>Kester</PERSON> says. But he adds: ``We have people come through
here who know nothing about horses except what they look like.''
   <PERSON>Kester</PERSON> says that after his course, they'll all be able to shoe a
horse and make a horseshoe from scratch.
   ``Sometimes you just can't buy what you need,'' <PERSON>Kester</PERSON> says.
``So you make it.''
   He says he learned the trade of a farrier as he teaches it: in
school.
   ``I'm a journeyman, certified horseshoer,'' he said. ``I've had
a lot of experience, and I've been in the teaching business for 15,
16 years.
   ``I went to school for it in <DATE>'66</DATE>. I thought I knew something
until I went to school and met people who did.''
   <PERSON>Kester</PERSON> says there's a lot to being a farrier, and it takes
instruction and practice. He says an unskilled person who shoes a
horse runs the risk of crippling the animal.
   His students don't spend all their time at the anvil. He's got a
textbook, a thick volume called ``The Principles of Horseshoeing
II,'' which contains information about anatomy, metallurgy and
history.
   <PERSON>Kester</PERSON> says there are many types of horseshoes for different
kinds of animals. There are lightweight, aluminum shoes for race
horses; large, heavy shoes for work animals; and even plastic shoes
for injured horses.
   Most horseshoes today are still metal and are nailed to a
horse's hoof. But synthetic and plastic shoes that are glued to the
hoof are beginning to take over.
   ``I think in 10 or 20 years the standard horseshoe we've known
for hundreds of years'll be obsolete,'' <PERSON>Kester</PERSON> says.
   As long as there are horses, there will be a need for people to
shoe them, but <PERSON>Kester</PERSON> says the farrier's business requires
individuals to go out and find clients.
   ``You don't go get a job'' just out of school, he says. ``You go
get a clientele. It's an entrepreneurial deal.''
   Clients vary. Racetracks are specialized and many require union
certification, he says, and working on show horses requires a high
level of skill. Horses with injured hoofs need a special kind of
care.
   In some ways, <PERSON>Kester</PERSON> says, he's an equine podiatrist. But he's
not a blacksmith.
   ``I call myself a horseshoer ... and that's what I am.''

STYLE: CUSTOM SHOES AND WIDE STYLES AVAILABLE FOR HARD-TO-FIT FEET

<P>
From its humble appearance, few would guess that <ORGANIZATION>Gia Shoe Design of U.S.A.</ORGANIZATION> 
attracts an occasional movie star or rock 'n' roll singer. 
</P>
<P>
The shop in a small strip shopping center in <LOCATION>Garden Grove</LOCATION> has none of the 
polished brass and studio lighting of finer shoe stores. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, patrons are greeted by the smell of cement glue and the sound of 
workers hammering away on leather soles. Cardboard boxes, scraps of leather and 
unfinished shoes fill every corner of the store. 
</P>
<P>
Yet people from as far away as <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> make pilgrimages to the 
no-frills shoe store because here they can order custom shoes in any size or 
style. 
</P>
<P>
"When people from <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood</ORGANIZATION> make a movie and need a 16th-Century-style shoe, I 
design it," says <PERSON>John Tran</PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION>Gia Shoe Design</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
If someone wants a blue suede shoe in Size Triple E, Tran will have a pair 
ready in 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, finding shoes to fit feet that don't conform to shoe 
manufacturers' rigid sizing has been as easy as squeezing a square peg in a 
round hole. Customers with wide feet usually had a narrow selection of styles. 
</P>
<P>
Today people with hard-to-fit feet are finding it easier than ever to be 
well-shod. 
</P>
<P>
Salomon's in <LOCATION>Westminster</LOCATION> specializes in wide shoes with a fashion flair. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until a few years ago, women with wide feet had to wear old lady shoes. 
(Wide shoes) were very conservative-looking," says <PERSON>Hugh Salomon</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>, 
owner of the store. 
</P>
<P>
Salomon used to operate a family shoe store which his own wife couldn't shop at 
because the store didn't stock wider shoes. When he opened his first shoe store 
in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> six years ago, he had to persuade shoe manufacturers to make their 
current styles in wider sizes. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently no one went to the manufacturers and told them of the need," he 
says. Now he has 25 to 30 manufacturers supplying him with wide shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"I can offer high fashion shoes in a variety of colors," he says. "They're 
shoes for the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
Most stores carry only Size B or C widths. Salomon's offers women's shoes from 
Size 5 to 11 in wide and extra wide sizes, up to a Triple E. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of women are squeezing into Bs" who should be wearing wider shoes, 
<ORGANIZATION>Salomon</ORGANIZATION> says. "Some are very vain and wouldn't wear a Triple E-width shoe. But 
these shoes are styled so they don't look wide." 
</P>
<P>
His store carries a pair of metallic flats in pewter with tiny gold studs for 
<MONEY>$64.95</MONEY>, soft penny loafers in burgundy, tan and black for <MONEY>$55.95</MONEY> and leather 
pumps with patent leather toes and brass buckles in purple, green, tan and 
black for <MONEY>$66.95</MONEY>. There are suede pumps in a rich shade of purple, black suede 
flats studded with colorful rhinestones and loafers in a multicolored faux 
snakeskin. 
</P>
<P>
Thieves Market, with stores in <LOCATION>El Toro</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fullerton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Costa Mesa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Los Alamitos</LOCATION>, 
sells boots in sizes to accommodate urban cowboys with large feet. 
</P>
<P>
At Thieves Market, one can find a lizard skin or alligator boot in sizes up to 
15 or 16, in widths up to Triple E. 
</P>
<P>
"We cater to the hard-to-fit," says <PERSON>Richard Downes</PERSON>, vice president of Thieves 
Market. "About <PERCENT>75%</PERCENT> of our sales are in the Size 9 to 11 range, but it's the 
remaining <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> that we're after. Nobody else is offering (these sizes)." 
</P>
<P>
Those who can't find a shoe in the style or size they want from ready-to-wear 
shoe stores can have them custom-made at <ORGANIZATION>Gia Shoe Design</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
From a shelf above his desk, Tran pulls down what looks like an ordinary shoe 
box, lifts the lid and reveals its strange contents: 
</P>
<P>
Inside there's an impression of two feet in a Styrofoam mold, with one foot 
slightly larger and wider than the other. Tran will use the impression to 
design a pair of shoes according to the feet's dimensions. 
</P>
<P>
"This way the shoe fits exactly the way the customer wants it to," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Some shoes have cork inserts built inside or one heel that's higher than the 
other for customers with foot problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I also make shoes for very tiny feet. These are a Size 2," <ORGANIZATION>Tran</ORGANIZATION> says, holding 
up a small pair of women's pumps. 
</P>
<P>
Customers can bring in a picture of a shoe from a magazine and <ORGANIZATION>Tran</ORGANIZATION> will draw 
up a pattern for it. Some bring a swatch of material and order shoes cut from 
red velvet or pink brocade. 
</P>
<P>
"If they have a fancy dress, we can build a shoe to match," says <ORGANIZATION>Tran</ORGANIZATION>, as he 
cuts out a shoe pattern from a piece of caramel-colored leather. 
</P>
<P>
His ankle boots with their pointed toes and crocodile trim have proved popular 
with teen-agers and rock singers. One singer had Tran design a pair of lace-up 
black patent leather boots. 
</P>
<P>
He charges about <MONEY>$100</MONEY> to <MONEY>$300</MONEY> for a pair of custom shoes, and about <MONEY>$300</MONEY> to 
<MONEY>$400</MONEY> for corrective shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Tran keeps patterns and sketches of shoes he has designed in an overstuffed 
binder. 
</P>
<P>
In a back room, workers sew together pieces of leather that have been cut from 
Tran's pattern. The so-called leather upper is then stretched over a mold 
shaped like a shoe. 
</P>
<P>
One worker glues the heel to the sole, then the sole is attached to the leather 
upper. Finally, the shoe is cleaned and buffed. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Gia Shoe Design</ORGANIZATION> makes 40 to 50 pairs of shoes a day -- enough to supply Tran's 
Garden Grove store and his five other franchise stores across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Shoe manufacturers often hire the company to make prototypes of new styles for 
national shoe fairs. 
</P>
<P>
Tran, 49, immigrated from <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> in <DATE>1975</DATE> and has been making shoes since <DATE>1956</DATE>. 
After working for several American shoe companies, he opened <ORGANIZATION>Gia</ORGANIZATION> Shoe Design in 
<DATE>1983</DATE>. A reminder of his native country stands in a corner of the shop -- a 
small altar with an Oriental statue of the Lucky Man. 
</P>
<P>
"It's to invite in customers," Tran explains. Especially those with wide feet.

<DESCRIPT>  DANCE; PALO-ALTO  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  LIKE flocks of penguins looking for a rookery, more than a thousand men in
tuxedos wandered the downtown streets of Palo Alto on Saturday night, with an
equal number of ball-gowned women beside them.;    Starting at City Hall on
Hamilton Avenue, they promenaded past Mac's newsstand on Emerson Street and
Zebra Copiers on University Avenue, finally coming to roost in celebratory
glory above the traffic on the Alma Street bridge. But they didn't come to
preen and pick at each other's feathers; they came to party.  </LEADPARA>

ALTO  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cover Stories  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     It was <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION>'s fifth annual Black and <LOCATION>White Ball</LOCATION>, which has exploded
from the first 125-person dance at <ORGANIZATION>Lucie Stern Community Center</ORGANIZATION> to a mega
gala-cum-dance riot that spreads from the Holiday Inn to the downtown CalTrain
station and <ORGANIZATION>MacArthur Park restaurant</ORGANIZATION>, with plenty of fun in between -- thanks
to the <ORGANIZATION>Galactic Rock Tent</ORGANIZATION>, a hip-hop DJ with projection dance screen towering
over the street and pedicabs schlepping revelers from one site to the other,
zipping through the strolling crowds.;    From <TIME>9 p.m.</TIME> until <TIME>2 a.m.</TIME> an army of
musicians and other entertainers held court at the scattered sites. As if
things weren't already lively enough, there was even a midnight raid by those
musical anarchists, the <ORGANIZATION>Stanford Marching Band.</ORGANIZATION>;    With streets closed off
and the 3,000 revelers converging nearly en masse, downtown <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION> was very
confused for a while. <PERSON>Maury Hearn</PERSON> and <PERSON>Shawn DeLuna</PERSON>, who just happened to be
cruising by in a fully restored and beautiful <DATE>1935</DATE> Packard Super Eight, caught
the attention of the <ORGANIZATION>Palo Alto Police</ORGANIZATION>, who assumed the guys were there for the
ball. They weren't, but they passed on through when the officers thoughtfully
moved a barricade for them. And, since they had their tuxedos on hand -- for a
Concours d'Elegance they planned to attend <DATE>Sunday</DATE> -- they parked the Packard
outside <ORGANIZATION>MacArthur Park</ORGANIZATION>, adding a touch of old-time elegance to the evening.;  
 For all that <MONEY>$50-a-head</MONEY> tickets and black-tie imply, it was a remarkably
egalitarian, universal party-hardy crowd of all ages, with women in beautiful
black lace swigging Coors in the street and very distinguished-looking men in
elegant tuxedos sweating clear through to their cummerbunds, dancing to the
<ORGANIZATION>Zasu Pitts Memorial Orchestra</ORGANIZATION> in the tent and the <PERSON>Pete Escovedo Orchestra</PERSON> at
<ORGANIZATION>MacArthur Park.</ORGANIZATION>;    There were lots of little black dresses, of course, but
also a number of elegant pantsuits, a fair amount of white satin, a generous
amount of lace. One woman in red, and another just barely held in by a gold
wrap-around number, added bright splashes of color to the black and white
evening. Very few men wore anything other than standard-issue tuxes, though
there was at least one pair of leather pants and the tyranny of black tie
formality was disturbed frequently by men wearing glow-in-the dark earrings.; 
  It was, however, painfully evident that very few attendees knew how to
samba, rumba or foxtrot. Really, <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION>, learn to dance.;    The best
dancers seemed to gravitate to the tent, for The Plaids and <PERSON>Zasu</PERSON>. It was sad
to see the <PERSON>Bill Lombardo Orchestra</PERSON> play a perfect fox trot in one of the two
Holiday Inn ballrooms for people who had no idea how to step-step-side-step.
In a second <ORGANIZATION>Holiday Inn</ORGANIZATION> ballroom, as the Charms (in really scary '50s poof
blond wigs) played "Tan Shoes and Pink Shoelaces," people just generally went
rhythmically insane, which was acceptable. All around them were tables piled
high with sweets ranging from strawberry shortcake to truffles to mini-quiches
to keep their energy levels up.;    Outside the Soda Shop on the darkened
lawn, <PERSON>Heidi Anderson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Marilyn Parker</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION> played with their
light-up yo-yos.;    "Watch out," <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> shouted, "I'm walking the dog!"
"Hey, honey, I'm going around the world," <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> yelled.;    By 10:45 the
lines to the women's rooms were dangerously long. At <ORGANIZATION>MacArthur Park</ORGANIZATION> an
emergency was declared and the men's room was turned into a second women's
room, with a hastily scrawled sign directing men to the temporary facilities
set up in the street. At the <ORGANIZATION>Holiday Inn</ORGANIZATION>, a gentleman threw his tuxedo over
his desperate date's face, and shouting "Girl on the floor!" escorted her
blindly into the mens room, where, of course, the lines were much shorter.;   
<PERSON>Patty Richmond</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION> was dancing to rap music on the Alma bridge when
she was startled by the sneak attack of the <ORGANIZATION>Stanford Band</ORGANIZATION>, which has been
thrown out of worse places than the <ORGANIZATION>Black and White Ball</ORGANIZATION>. "If I'd been dancing
to a song I really liked," <PERSON>Richmond</PERSON> said, "It would have made me mad, I guess,
but this was all right.";    The guerrilla commandos of marching music, the
<ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> anarchists rushed around the train station parking loop, then took a

<PERSON>Sherri Shenk</PERSON> of <PERSON>Atherton</PERSON> started through the graffiti-covered pedestrian
tunnel back to downtown. Seduced by the great, resonant echoes, <PERSON>John Shenk</PERSON>
cupped his hands and capped the evening with a series of animal howls:
"Arooooooo!" he yelled into the <TIME>night</TIME>. "Yip-yup-ah-arooooo!"  </TEXT>

   Cannon Beach, Ore. -- The big issue confronting the
Sneaker Society these days is what, exactly, to do with all
the sneakers.
   Someone suggested to Steve McLeod (size 8), who is an
artist here, that he paint his cache -- he's found 64 pairs
and 40 unmatched shoes -- and sell the pieces as sculptures.
Sherli Tarnasky (size 7 1/2), a city clerk in nearby Rockaway
Beach, thinks she might turn hers into some sort of gift-shop
novelty, something akin to Pet Rocks. Burke and Lisa Pond
(sizes 10 and 8 1/2), who have lined up their 150-odd shoes
in a greenhouse behind their Astoria home, are just looking
for buyers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Mr. McLeod</PERSON>, for one, doesn't want to do anything just yet.
"I feel like if we do, it'll blow the whole karma of the
thing," he said.
   The sneakers -- they're mostly brand new, high-end Nikes
-- have been washing up on beaches in <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>
since the beginning of <DATE>April</DATE>. At first, nobody knew why.
Those who picked them up just gave them a good scrubbing to
get rid of the long-neck barnacles and the seaweed coating
and the sand. When a <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION> television station put an item
on the <TIME>evening</TIME> news about <PERSON>Ms. Tarnasky</PERSON> and her new shoe
collection, she started getting calls from other beachcombers
who'd picked up shares of the loot. It turned out the shoes
had spent some time in the currents: Five 40-foot containers
of Nikes -- 40,000 pairs in all -- had fallen off the deck of
a South Korea-to-Seattle cargo ship in <DATE>May 1990</DATE>.
   The Sneaker Society -- the name was <PERSON>Mr. McLeod</PERSON>'s idea --
started one <DATE>Sunday</DATE> afternoon in early <DATE>spring</DATE> when <PERSON>Ms.
Tarnasky</PERSON>, a stout, effusive woman, invited everyone over to
barbecue burgers and try to swap the shoes to make pairs.
   All the members of the society have different stories
about how they first came across the shoes. <PERSON>Mr. McLeod</PERSON> was
walking on the beach near his home when he spotted a
seaweed-covered <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION> hiking boot in his size. He didn't think
much of it until the <DATE>next day</DATE>, when he found a matching shoe
-- same model, same size -- a few miles down the beach. Since
then he's done little besides scour the beaches of <LOCATION>Clatsop
County</LOCATION> in search of mint-condition Nikes.
   When I visited his apartment, half a block from the
<LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>, it wasn't hard to see that his efforts had met with
some success: There are Nikes everywhere. He has 17 pairs of
<ORGANIZATION>Cross Trainers</ORGANIZATION>, three pairs of hiking boots, three pairs of
high-top basketball shoes (two Strike Forces and one Solo
Flight), two pairs of Lady <ORGANIZATION>Pegasus</ORGANIZATION> running shoes, two pairs
of black <PERSON>Healthwalkers</PERSON> and 15 pairs of golf shoes.
   <PERSON>Mr. McLeod</PERSON>, a soft-spoken man with a salt-and-pepper
beard, admitted that he was in the midst of a midlife crisis
even before the sneaker wave. He'd been looking for a break
from his routine, and mating orphaned sports shoes has
brought some new meaning to his life. "I'm just kind of
obsessed with the idea of putting all these pairs together,"
he said.
   <PERSON>Ms. Tarnasky</PERSON> was walking Dixie, her elkhound, one evening
in <DATE>April</DATE> when the surfeit of washed-up tennis shoes caught
her eye. With the help of a neighbor, she collected 49 shoes
and dumped them in the beach grass behind her house.
   When I asked <PERSON>Mr. McLeod</PERSON> what sort of shoes he used to
wear, he got excited for a moment. "You want to see?" he said
eagerly, as if he were about to reveal to me a great secret.
"I'll show you." He trotted into his bedroom and emerged with
the full lineup: a pair of duck boots he got from his father
20 years ago, some worn out work boots and two fraying pairs
of moccasins. "I must be one of the only people in <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>
who's never had a pair of Nikes before," he said. (<ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION> is
based in a <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION> suburb.) These days, he pads around the
house in a pair of white-and-gray Cross Trainers that retail
for about <MONEY>$85</MONEY>.
   In fact, none of the members of the Sneaker Society are
the types to make fancy athletic shoes a priority in their
wardrobe budget. <PERSON>Burke Pond</PERSON>, for instance, a 62-year-old with
a striking resemblance to <PERSON>Fidel Castro</PERSON>, has bought sneakers
before, but only the type he can pick up for <MONEY>$9.95</MONEY> at
discount stores. "No one in my generation would ever pay <MONEY>$100</MONEY>
for tennis shoes," he said. "But I'm sold on them now."
   <PERSON>Mr. McLeod</PERSON> said he doesn't understand the appeal of the
shoes. "If people wanted my paintings the way they want these
shoes," he said, "I'd be in real good shape."
   Everyone in the <ORGANIZATION>Sneaker Society</ORGANIZATION> seems hesitant to part
with their spoils. A lot of <PERSON>Mr. McLeod</PERSON>'s neighbors here,
noticing the sneakers lined up to dry on his balcony and
outside his front door, have dropped by to inquire.
"Everybody says, `Oh, I'll take a pair,'" he said. "But the
longer I scrub them, the harder they are to give away." And
even once they decide what to do with the pairs, no one can
figure out what to do with the leftover singles, though <PERSON>Ms.
Tarnasky</PERSON> thought she was on to something when she got a call
from a man in <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> who was interested because his feet were
different sizes. "I didn't ask him why," she said.
   All sorts of things wash up on the beaches in <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>. The
Ponds' basement is full of the stuff they've collected on
their daily walks: glass floats from Japanese fishing nets,
crab pots, spools of rope, barrels, a plastic owl, rice
bowls, a table, a mailbox. <PERSON>Mr. McLeod</PERSON> has furnished most of
his apartment with stuff that's turned up on the beach. And
he once found a woman's body -- though he doesn't seem to
want to talk about that one.
   Still, the arrival of hundreds of high-tech athletic shoes
in high tide was unusual enough to merit some notice in the
local media. <PERSON>Mr. McLeod</PERSON>, for one, got so many calls from
curious people and reporters that he made a call to the
people at <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION> to make sure he wasn't saying anything they
didn't want him to say. The woman who answered the telephone
asked him for his address, so she could send him a <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION>
T-shirt. "I was never expecting them to reward us," he said.
"But I said, `If you really feel like doing something nice,
you can send a couple boxes of laces.'"

   Want to run faster and jump higher? 

   No sweat. 
All you have to do is lace up a pair of high-tech sneakers. 

   It's all part of the shoes' "biomechanical" design -- which has replaced fashion as the selling hook in athletic-shoe advertising. 
The new shoes, their makers say, collect energy released by each step and return some of it to the wearer. 

   The performance revolution, however, may be more gimmick than substance. 

   For one thing, most athletic-shoe buyers -- <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT>, in fact -- wear them for walking. 
In addition, researchers question just how much of an advance the high-tech shoes represent for runners. 
Even people in the industry get a bit fuzzy when they talk about what they're pitching. 

   "I run in the shoes myself," says <PERSON>Brian Igoe</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Reebok International Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> marketing executive. 
"I like them, but I don't know how much energy return I'm getting." 

   Nevertheless, the shoe makers know a good sales pitch when they see it -- especially with the Summer Olympics coming. 
"The feeling among companies," says <PERSON>Mr. Igoe</PERSON>, "is that the general public will say, 'Hey, if the shoe is good to run a marathon in, then it's certainly good to go to the supermarket in.'" 
Shoe makers also think consumers are tiring of the fashion emphasis -- started by <ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1983</DATE> -- and may be ripe for a new approach. 

   Companies are pouring money into advertising the high-tech shoes, which cost <MONEY>$65</MONEY> to <MONEY>$100</MONEY> a pair. 
The progenitor of the breed was <ORGANIZATION>Nike Inc.</ORGANIZATION>'s Air Revolution shoe, introduced last year with television ads set to the Beatles' "Revolution" and print ads promising improved performance. 
Several rivals have been introduced recently, or will be soon, including the Energy Wave shoe from <ORGANIZATION>Converse Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Interco Inc.</ORGANIZATION>; the World Trainer shoe, with an "Energy Return System," from <ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION>; and a line of shoes from <ORGANIZATION>Etonic Inc.</ORGANIZATION> using a "Dynamic Reaction Plate." 

   The shoes have similar designs: A resilient substance, such as polyurethane, gel or compressed air, is sandwiched in the sole. 
The companies say the substance both cushions the foot as it hits the ground and captures some of the energy released and returns it to the foot. 

   In their ads, the shoe makers promise improved performance -- much as <ORGANIZATION>Hyde Athletic Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> did back in the <DATE>1950s</DATE> when it said PF Flyers would make kids walk, run and jump better. 
"Imagine how much easier running would be," reads a current <ORGANIZATION>Etonic</ORGANIZATION> ad for the reaction plate, "if people could actually get energy from their shoes, so they could use less of their own." 
A <ORGANIZATION>Converse</ORGANIZATION> ad promises, "Athletes riding the (Energy) Wave can keep fresher legs, jump higher, run further." 

   The ads often cite in-house research in claiming that the company's shoes are better than the competition's. 
<ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION>, for instance, says its Energy Return System is superior to the <ORGANIZATION>Nike Air Max</ORGANIZATION> and the Tiger Gel (made by <ORGANIZATION>Asics Tiger Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Asics Tiger Japan</ORGANIZATION>) by "up to <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT>." 
Converse says its Energy Wave "provides <PERCENT>77%</PERCENT> more energy return than (<ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION>'s) Air." 

   <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION> dismisses these attacks as "unscientific." 
<PERSON>Martin Short</PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION>'s sports research division, says, "What <ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION> says is energy return is not necessarily what we define as energy return." 

   Some researchers say the high-tech footwear isn't significantly better than its predecessors. 
<PERSON>Peter Cavanagh</PERSON>, a professor of biomechanics at <ORGANIZATION>Pennsylvania State University</ORGANIZATION> and author of a book on running shoes, says buyers "have had high-energy return shoes all along without realizing it. 
What has happened is that the companies never before considered high energy as a marketing plan."

<TEXT>
   While <PERSON>Richard Nixon</PERSON> was on the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> to
open his presidential library, actor <PERSON>Jim Cooke</PERSON> did what he could
here <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to revive the reputation of another maligned
president, <PERSON>Calvin Coolidge</PERSON>.
   He brought his one-man show, ``More Than Two Words,'' to the
<ORGANIZATION>National Archives</ORGANIZATION> auditorium to repeat the wit and words of a chief
executive who is usually pictured as possessing little of either.
   The show's title comes from a Coolidge story, perhaps apocryphal.
   ``Oh, <PERSON>Mr. Coolidge</PERSON>!'' a dinner partner is said to have gushed to
a president known for his taciturn tendencies. ``I've made a five
dollar bet that I can get more than two words out of you.''
   Said he to her: ``You lose.''
   Cooke, 53, like <PERSON>Coolidge</PERSON> a flinty Vermonter, tried to hide his
dismay when he was reminded in an interview that history has not
been kind to <PERSON>Coolidge</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Samuel Eliot Morison</PERSON>, in his ``Oxford History of the American
People,'' said this of the man who served as president for six
years during the tumultuous 1920s:
   ``A mean, thin-lipped little man, a respectable mediocrity, he
lived parsimoniously but admired men of wealth, and his political
principles were those current in <DATE>1902</DATE>. People thought <PERSON>Coolidge</PERSON>
brighter than he was because he seldom said anything. ...
   ``<PERSON>Mrs. Coolidge</PERSON> was a handsome and gracious lady, without whom
the formal parties at the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> would have been unbearably
grim. She helped this dour, abstemious and unimaginative figure to
become one of the most popular American presidents.''
   Cooke flinched when reminded.
   He said maybe historians had been so enamored of <PERSON>Franklin D.
Roosevelt</PERSON> ``that they got into the habit of denigrating anyone who
came before him.''
   Maybe it was the mad-dog midday heat that brought them in, but a
lunchtime audience of Washingtonians spent an hour with <PERSON>Cooke</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Coolidge</PERSON>. By coincidence, the performance occurred on the same day
that <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON>, another former president with a rotten reputation, was
in <LOCATION>Yorba Linda</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, for a ceremony opening his presidential
library to the public.
   Cooke recited lines from <PERSON>Coolidge</PERSON>'s twice-weekly news
conferences, from his speeches, from his autobiography first
serialized in Cosmopolitan magazine in <DATE>1933</DATE>, and from his letters
to his father, always signed, ``Your son, <PERSON>Calvin Coolidge</PERSON>.''
   Coolidge, <PERSON>Cooke</PERSON> said later, delivered his humor deadpan, almost
with a scowl, so effectively that people didn't know he was joking.
   At a news conference, talking about retirement and twitting his
reputation for parsimony, he said: ``I would like to report that
there is no foundation to the rumor that I have been offered an
opportunity to teach a course in thrift at <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>University of
Aberdeen</ORGANIZATION>.''
   And hidden deep within a paragraph of his autobiography: ``The
pressure to speak is constant and intolerable. However, I resisted
most of it.''
   ``I have found in the course of a long public career,'' said
<PERSON>Coolidge</PERSON> and recited <PERSON>Cooke</PERSON>, ``that the things I did not say never
hurt me.''
   For the occasion, <PERSON>Cooke</PERSON> wore a starched, high-collared shirt, a
tight double-breasted suit and high-lace shoes.
   He used to teach theater at <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Emerson College</ORGANIZATION>, has done
<PERSON>Coolidge</PERSON> 40 or 50 times over the <DATE>last five years</DATE> and hopes to do it
in each of the 48 states in the union when <PERSON>Coolidge</PERSON> was in the
<ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``I've come to like him a lot,'' said <PERSON>Cooke</PERSON>. He also likes what
<PERSON>Coolidge</PERSON>'s son, <PERSON>John</PERSON>, 83, said _ Coolidgelike _ when he took in
<ORGANIZATION>Cooke</ORGANIZATION>'s first performance in <ORGANIZATION>Coolidge</ORGANIZATION>'s hometown, <LOCATION>Plymouth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Vt.</LOCATION>:
``I thought he did quite well.''
   After the show, <PERSON>Fran Wells</PERSON>, who came here in <DATE>1939</DATE> and worked for
the old <ORGANIZATION>War Production Board</ORGANIZATION> and for the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Trade Commission</ORGANIZATION>
and the <ORGANIZATION>Postal Service</ORGANIZATION>, hurried up to <PERSON>Cooke</PERSON> and said, ``I have to
tell you, I have a better opinion of that man.''
   Coolidge might have frowned. Cooke beamed.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Fashion: Stocking up on accessories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN you hang up your stocking for <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION> this year, make sure it is a matt,
black, opaque one. Into such a voguish receptacle the modern Father
Christmas (wearing red biker's leathers trimmed with white fake fur and
riding a <PERSON>Harley Davidson</PERSON> instead of a reindeer sleigh) will be unable to
resist pouring all your accessory requests.
With many women exercising a strict moratorium on serious fashion buys, this
year it is the essential accessory or inexpensive basic item that updates
your wardrobe and most of them are not too pricy for the present list.
Start with jodhpurs - although you may need a pillowcase rather than a
stocking if that is what you really want.
Jodhpurs are this year's advance on leggings to go with <DATE>last winter</DATE>'s
comfortable loose sweater or shirt, but also good with dandy-style
equestrian jackets. Best in basic black, they are Pounds 49.95 by <PERSON>Huntsman</PERSON>
from <PERSON>Fenwick</PERSON>, Pounds 29.99 at <ORGANIZATION>Stirling Cooper</ORGANIZATION> and from Pounds 19.99 to
Pounds 34.99 at <PERSON>Miss Selfridge</PERSON>.
Black leather jeans are every designer collection's must-have, but Top
Shop's are only Pounds 59.99, <PERSON>Miss Selfridge</PERSON>'s Pounds 69.99.
The new long-skirted or slim-trousered silhouette demands a new shoe shape,
with more of a heel, perhaps a slight platform (do not overdo it unless you
think <PERSON>Minnie Mouse</PERSON> is elegant) and a higher cut such as lace-up or
elastic-sided ankle boot.
Red or Dead's styles in this vein go from Pounds 60, <ORGANIZATION>Pied-a-Terre</ORGANIZATION>'s from
Pounds 39 to Pounds 99 and <PERSON>Russell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bromley</PERSON> have wonderful long-toed
lace-up ankle-boots for Pounds 95.50.
Bored with the plain white shirt that has gone under your suit jacket for
the past three seasons? Then abandon the jacket and try a cobwebby black
crochet waistcoat as the first salvo in the <DATE>1970s</DATE> fashion war.
Costing Pounds 25 at <PERSON>Miss Selfridge</PERSON>, and Pounds 24.99 at Top Shop, the black
crochet will also see you through party evenings over velvet or chiffon.
Printed waistcoats are a big part of the dandy look for women and men - from
Pounds 25 at <ORGANIZATION>Marks</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Spencer</PERSON> to Pounds 59 and Pounds 99 (this one in silk)
at <LOCATION>Fenwick</LOCATION>.
Another variant on the white shirt is an old-fashioned men's white silk
evening scarf (from antique shops or new version at <ORGANIZATION>Fenwick</ORGANIZATION>, Pounds 19.95)
tied stock-style on the neck. Newest in scarves, and a pointer for next
<DATE>spring</DATE>, is the long, 1920s style, in shimmery pale printed panne velvet,
Pounds 69, or soft plain silk with contrast border, Pounds 85, from <PERSON>Georgina
von Etzdorf</PERSON> (who can match the print in ties and scarves for your man).

FT  19 MAR 94 / How to Spend it: No match for a pair of shoes - Stand out in
a crowd with odd footwear.  A Spanish designer and producer with an original
range - from the asymmetrical, to more classic styles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone accustomed to buying shoes that are absolutely identical has probably
not stopped to consider whether there is some immutable law behind this
perfect symmetry.
Since our childhood, shoes have come in pairs and the likelihood was that
they would do so for ever more.
But Camper, a Spanish company based in <LOCATION>Majorca</LOCATION>, decided to look at the
matter differently. 'Why,' it asked, 'is that throughout history a pair of
shoes has always been made symmetrical, the left exactly the same as the
right?'
And it followed this up with another question: 'Why can't a pair of shoes be
disparate, asymmetrical and the left different from the right?' Twins, after
all, are not necessarily identical and sometimes even scarcely resemble each
other.
It went on to point out that the notion of asymmetry has a distinguished
architectural lineage - from <LOCATION>Gaudi</LOCATION> and Le Corbusier in the fields of
architecture to <LOCATION>Vionnet</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Miyake</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Yohji Yamamoto</PERSON> and <PERSON>Rei Kawakubo</PERSON> in the
field of fashion.
From there it was a short step to an exercise in exploring the asymmetrical
pairs of shoes, some of which are photographed here. The kinship between the
shoes is obvious - there could be no mistaking that they belong to the same
pair and yet each left is subtly, and sometimes not so subtly, different
from the right.
For those who find this breaking of the established rules of footwear a
trifle alarming, Camper does produce other ranges which, though less
innovatory, are just as interesting.
Its Camaleon line is a self-conscious recreation of a peasant shoe, the sort
worn by country people all over <LOCATION>Majorca</LOCATION>. The perfect shoe for the
ecologically concerned, it is made from unusable off-cuts of leather, worn
out tyres and strips of canvas.
It also occurs to me that it is the perfect shoe for those who dislike
anything that looks too new - these shoes look as if they have already been
to some interesting places before they leave the shop. For those who do not
lead the life of a country peasant these shoes are the sort to take on
holiday, to beaches, to <LOCATION>Majorca</LOCATION> perhaps.
Perfect for those who spend <DATE>summer</DATE> holidays on beaches or in hot climates is
the Terra collection. Based on the old-fashioned espadrille it has been
updated by dyeing the canvas with colours and patterns and using new
materials (rubber and natural rope) for the sole which give it greater
strength without detracting from the original 'look'.
Camper also has a range for real traditionalists - the Cartujano which aims
to marry traditional Spanish styling with fine quality leather. There are
soft loafers, brogues, boots - the whole gamut of classic footwear.
The Camper range can be found at <ORGANIZATION>Paul Smith of Floral Street</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Covent Garden</ORGANIZATION>,
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> WC2; <PERSON>Nichols</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION>; Matches of <LOCATION>Wimbledon</LOCATION>; Limeys of
<LOCATION>Leicester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sheffield</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Derby</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nottingham</LOCATION>; The Natural Shoe Store, 325 Kings
Road, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> SW3; and 21 <PERSON>Neal Street</PERSON>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> WC2. Prices range from Pounds
45-Pounds 80.
If your tastes are more classic still it might be worth looking at the
Paraboot which has similarly romantic origins. Camper shoes are made using
traditional methods in little workshops all over <LOCATION>Majorca</LOCATION>, while the Paraboot
comes from the small village of Izeaux in the <LOCATION>Isere</LOCATION> region of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. The
original footwear produced in <LOCATION>Izeaux</LOCATION> was practical and sturdy, shoes for the
tough farming life, often made in the farmers' own homes with crude tools.
However, <PERSON>Remy Richard-Pontvert</PERSON>, a local cobbler, began to visit fine <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>
boutiques and saw that quality and finish were important if he wanted to
expand and sell to more sophisticated shoppers. While in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> he saw
rubber-soled shoes. He went straight home and developed and then patented
his own rubber sole from which evolved the Paraboot (the rubber came from
<LOCATION>Para</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>).
In <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> they are as well-known as <ORGANIZATION>Church</ORGANIZATION>'s are in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>. They are made
from fine full-grain leather and all the stitching is still done by hand.
They have only fairly recently been on sale in the UK but have already
become much sought after.
Most famous shoe in the range is possibly <PERSON>Michael</PERSON>, a soft casual lace-up but
there are loafers, brogues, boots, golf shoes and boat shoes. Prices range
around Pounds 105 a pair and the shoes can be found in good men's shoe
shops, including Office Shoes, Jigsaw for Men, <PERSON>Woodhouse</PERSON> and Selfridges in
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.

   Andy is a 2-year-old with a new pair of
shoes. Nothing unusual about that, except that <PERSON>Andy</PERSON> is a goose.
   Andy, owned by <PERSON>Gene Fleming</PERSON> of <PERSON>Hastings</PERSON>, was born without feet
and has legs that end in stumps just below the ankle.
   ``He had to balance himself like a child on stilts,'' <PERSON>Fleming</PERSON>
said.
   Until recently, <PERSON>Andy</PERSON>'s legs weren't big enough to support shoes.
Fleming bought leather shoes _ size 0 _ for Andy.
   Now, the goose can walk, run and swim.
   ``Those shoes gave him a whole new lease on life,'' <PERSON>Fleming</PERSON>
said. ``Now he can outswim the other geese.''
   <PERSON>Fleming</PERSON> said the idea for shoes came easily, but that keeping
the shoes on a goose was another matter.
   He modified the shoes, putting foam rubber in the end for
comfort and to keep them from turning around. He also had to glue
the bows to the shoe because Andy kept untying the laces. Small
holes in the bottom of each shoe allows water to drain so the
leather won't freeze in winter.
   ``He just loves 'em,'' <PERSON>Fleming</PERSON> said. ``He doesn't try to kick
them off any more. He used to think he had mud on his feet and kept
kicking backward. Now he's got a big smile on his face.''

<HEAD>Horde Of Potential Heirs Appear To Claim Miser's Fortune</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   News reports of a 77-year-old miser who
died with no known relatives and had <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> stashed in banks
across the country have drawn out a horde of would-be heirs.
   And now the lawyer in charge of the man's estate has got a judge
to agree to a search for even more money.
   At least 400 people claiming blood ties to <PERSON>Henry Drummond</PERSON> have
called the <ORGANIZATION>Ingham County Probate Court</ORGANIZATION> or <PERSON>Paul Rosenbaum</PERSON>, the
state-appointed lawyer handling <ORGANIZATION>Drummond</ORGANIZATION>'s estate. An additional 150
have written.
   ``I have about 100 people asking for checks who say they are
second cousins twice-removed,'' <PERSON>Rosenbaum</PERSON> said. ``It's like `Send me
a check, we'll figure out how I'm related later.'''
   If no relatives are found, <ORGANIZATION>Drummond</ORGANIZATION>'s estate will go to the state
of <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>.
   Thanks to bank correspondence found in <ORGANIZATION>Drummond</ORGANIZATION>'s <MONEY>$49-a-week</MONEY> room
at the <ORGANIZATION>YMCA</ORGANIZATION> in downtown <LOCATION>Lansing</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Rosenbaum</PERSON> has located accounts
holding more than <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> in nine banks from <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>.
   And during a hearing <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in <ORGANIZATION>Ingham County Probate Court</ORGANIZATION>,
<PERSON>Rosenbaum</PERSON> said <PERSON>Drummond</PERSON>'s fortune could be even larger than first
thought, swelled by what he believes are extensive holdings in
stocks and bonds.
   In addition to the mail from banks in <LOCATION>Drummond</LOCATION>'s room, the lawyer
said he found a key to a safe-deposit box, but it doesn't fit any
safe-deposit boxes in <LOCATION>Lansing</LOCATION>. Judge <ORGANIZATION>George Economy</ORGANIZATION> authorized
<PERSON>Rosenbaum</PERSON> to spend <MONEY>$5,000</MONEY> to hire a private investigator to scour
the country for the box that matches the key.
   Drummond died <DATE>Jan. 28</DATE>, three weeks after he was found unconscious
in his <MONEY>$49-a-week</MONEY> room at the <ORGANIZATION>YMCA</ORGANIZATION> in downtown <LOCATION>Lansing</LOCATION>.
   He had come to town in <DATE>1985</DATE>, and spent his days roaming the
streets.
   He wore an old fedora, an old coat and had unwashed, scraggly
hair and a beard. He apparently did not bathe often. Workers in the
Federal Building once chipped in and bought <PERSON>Drummond</PERSON> a suit and
other clothes. He never wore them.
   If anyone asked about his past or his family, he would become
evasive, said postal worker <PERSON>Francis Dodge</PERSON>.
   In <ORGANIZATION>Drummond</ORGANIZATION>'s room, <PERSON>Rosenbaum</PERSON> found hundreds of pairs of used
shoe laces, three old suits, eight pairs of shoes and 50 pairs of
white socks. One drawer was full of clippings and pictures of
<ORGANIZATION>Princess Diana of Great Britain</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Rosenbaum</PERSON> also found journals in <ORGANIZATION>Drummond</ORGANIZATION>'s handwriting, from
which he has been able to put together a sketchy history.
   <PERSON>Drummond</PERSON> was born <DATE>June 27, 1911</DATE>, in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>. His father was <PERSON>John
T. Drummond</PERSON>, a carpenter for the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Railroad</ORGANIZATION>. His
mother's maiden name was <PERSON>Westelle Rosalie Howard</PERSON>. He was an only
child.
   When <PERSON>Drummond</PERSON> was 4, his father left and later died in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>.
His mother died in <DATE>1952</DATE> at the age of 80.
   Drummond graduated from high school in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, and
worked in a bank. He was drafted in <DATE>1942</DATE> and served four years in
the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> as a clerk-typist, before returning to the bank.
   Drummond wrote that he was fired from his bank job in <DATE>1959</DATE> by a
man who accused him of stealing adhesive tape and other supplies. He
then worked as a postal clerk in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> until he retired in <DATE>1973</DATE>.
   Then it was on to <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>, where he lived at a <ORGANIZATION>YMCA</ORGANIZATION> until <DATE>1981</DATE>. He
spent the next four years roaming the <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION>, staying at YMCAs
and opening bank accounts.
   Drummond was earning some <MONEY>$20,000</MONEY> a year in interest and his
government pension when he died.

   First came Nike's Air shoe. Then came Reebok's Pump. And
now there's Puma's Disc System sneaker.
   Forget about shoe laces and a tongue. The Disc System
instead features a "closure unit" that is turned like the
dial on a ski boot, an "anatomically pre-molded compression
unit" that replaces the tongue and "lateral stabilizing
elements" that tighten the sides for a better fit. All for
just $125 a pair.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It may sound more like astronaut gear than a sneaker, but
that's the point. In the athletic footwear world, the race is
not so much to the swift nowadays as to the one with the
latest gimmick.
   "This industry has turned into the battle of the bells and
whistles. . . . For a time, there even was a real wild shoe
you could hook up to your computer to tell how far you've
run," says <PERSON>Steven Frankel</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Adams Harkness &amp;
Hill Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
   Indeed, with the <MONEY>$5.5 billion</MONEY> <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sneaker market maturing
and showing little growth, dozens of makers are touting their
own high-technology shoes, from <ORGANIZATION>Adidas AG</ORGANIZATION>'s Tortion Bar to
<ORGANIZATION>Interco Inc.</ORGANIZATION>'s Converse Y-Bar to <ORGANIZATION>Hyde Inc.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Saucony Ground
Reaction Inertia Device</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Reebok International Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Avia
Compression Chamber</ORGANIZATION> system.
   Whether the <ORGANIZATION>Disc System</ORGANIZATION> shoe will revive the sluggish
sales of <ORGANIZATION>Puma USA</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> unit of <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Aritmos</ORGANIZATION>, remains
to be seen. Most hot shoes have proved to be fads, as fickle
buyers -- especially teenagers, the biggest part of the
market -- switch brands frequently.
   <ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION>'s Pump, which quickly became a big hit when it was
introduced two years ago, already shows signs of being
winded. So <ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION> will soon introduce the Double Pump, a
sneaker that -- yes -- features not one but two air bladders
and two inflation gadgets to pump more air into more parts of
the shoe. It will retail for <MONEY>$159</MONEY> a pair.
   <ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION> says the new shoe will expand the Pump line, and
not replace the single Pump, which costs less. "The Pump
provides a custom fit, but the Double Pump can tailor almost
all of the shoe to the foot," says <PERSON>John H. Duerden</PERSON>, president
and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION> brands.
   The brief history of the Pump shows how tough the athletic
shoe business has become -- even for hits. Hoping to improve
<ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION>'s image as a performance shoe, the company targeted
the 18-to-35-year-old male. But most buyers were younger, as
the shoe became a status symbol for teenagers and their
pre-teen siblings. "I have four-year-olds coming into the
store asking for the Pump," notes <PERSON>Liz Butler</PERSON>, assistant
manager for Lady's Athlete's Foot in <LOCATION>Burlington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION> "And a
friend of mine has an infant who wears Pumps."
   This year, the Pump will account for about <PERCENT>7%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION>'s
shoe sales. <ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION> says it remains a strong brand, but orders
have dropped, in part because kids are looking for something
new. "It's a very fickle, very fashion-oriented crowd,"
explains <PERSON>Josie Esquivel</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Brothers</ORGANIZATION> analyst.
"With them, once the fizz is gone, that's it."
   Also hampering the Pump's image were a number of unhappy
customers who returned the shoes to stores either because of
manufacturing defects or complaints that it took too long to
pump up the shoe. "Several of my customers brought the pump
back because the soles fell off or because of a flat-tire
feeling in the arch area," reports <PERSON>Gregory Hatch</PERSON>, an
assistant manager of <PERSON>Snyder</PERSON>'s Shoe Store in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>
"Consequently, the Pump started losing its status symbol in
the eyes of my customers."
   <ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION> says that any problems have been fixed, and that
excitement over the Double Pump will breathe new life into
the brand. Others aren't so sure. "The Double Pump won't be
overnight salvation," predicts <PERSON>John Horan</PERSON>, editor and
publisher of <ORGANIZATION>Sporting Goods Intelligence Management News
Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, an industry newsletter. "It's going to be a very long
and slow process educating the consumer that this is more
than just a gimmick."
   To be sure, the Pump was a breath of fresh air for <ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION>,
which two years ago lost the industry lead in sales to
archrival <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION>. The new line helped <ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION> regain brand
momentum, boost profits, hoist its stock price <PERCENT>250%</PERCENT> this year
and take a run at <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION>. Stealing business from some of its
smaller competitors, including <ORGANIZATION>L.A. Gear Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION>
expanded its market share from <PERCENT>22%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>24%</PERCENT>, much of the gain
coming in the last year. That compares with <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT>.
   Backed by award-winning advertising, <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION>'s nine-year-old
Air line is clearly the dominant brand in the market. In
<DATE>fiscal 1991</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION> sold 40 million pairs of its Air line. By
comparison, <ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION> sold six million pair of Pumps, albeit a
much newer line, in two years.
   Some customers are wary of all the high-tech hype. "This
is absolutely crazy," says <PERSON>John Sagebrush</PERSON>, a federal court
clerk, while hunting for a pair of sneakers at a store in
downtown <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>. Scanning a wall mounted with more than 60
different styles and listening to a salesman's description of
their features, he sighs, "How can a man decide? They all
look the same and all sound good enough to wear."
   <ORGANIZATION>Adidas</ORGANIZATION>, in fact, is trying to take advantage of the
confusion. To raise its shoes above the clutter, <ORGANIZATION>Adidas</ORGANIZATION> says
in its current catalog, "People are tired of gimmicks, hype
and inflated pricing. They want honest performance, quality
and value. . . . It's time to get back to what is essential."
   Puma insists that its Disc System isn't a gimmick, but a
major step forward in improving fit and performance. "Sure, a
lot of us feel there are lots of gimmicks out there, but the
Disc is giving consumers a tangible benefit," says <PERSON>John
O'Rourke</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Puma USA</ORGANIZATION>.
   Here's how the shoe works: After slipping it on, you
tighten it by turning the disc that's where the tongue is
located on conventional sneakers. The disc is connected to a
series of nylon cords that extend to various parts of the
shoe -- unlike shoelaces, which tighten only the top of a
conventional shoe. This results in a better fit, the company
says. The system is released by turning the disc in the
opposite direction or pressing a release button. <ORGANIZATION>Puma</ORGANIZATION> will
begin selling running, tennis, "cross-training" and track
spike versions of the shoes next <DATE>spring</DATE>.
   No matter how good the shoe is, it won't be easy for <ORGANIZATION>Puma</ORGANIZATION>
to succeed against the marketing clout of <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION>,
which dominate the market and spend more than <MONEY>$75 million</MONEY> a
year each on advertising.
   "There's so much product out there," says <PERSON>Jennifer Black
Groves</PERSON>, analyst for <ORGANIZATION>Black &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION> "Sometimes,
it comes down to who can shout the loudest and the longest."
   Still, the Disc System just might catch the fancy of
consumers. "The athletic shoe market is a strange business
with lots of surprises," says <PERSON>Ms. Esquivel</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>
analyst.

   Few people realize that the U.S. Customs Service is
perhaps the most philosophic of all government agencies.
Customs Service employees routinely wrestle with such age-old
questions as "Is a popcorn popper an electrothermic appliance
or an electrical article?" and "Is a jeep a truck or a car?"
The U.S. has 8,753 different tariff classifications, with
tariffs ranging from zero to 458%. Naturally, tariff
classification rulings are often disputed with a passion that
would have made St. Thomas Aquinas proud.
   Take tariff classification ruling 89-27(6), which could
have a major impact on some Americans' social lives. Customs
decreed in 1989 that condoms imported from Mexico that are
electronically tested must carry a higher import tax than
condoms that are not tested. Customs also ruled that
importers must pay more for condoms that include a spermicide
than they would for condoms without spermicide. (It is not
known whether this decision was part of a secret plan to
boost the revenues of family planning clinics.)
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The arbitrariness of such customs decisions can devastate
importers and destabilize international trade. Here are a few
more examples from the Customs casebook:
   -- Girls' jackets. The <ORGANIZATION>Customs Service</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1988</DATE> boosted the
tariff on a shipment of 33,000 girls' ski jackets to <PERCENT>27.5%</PERCENT>
plus <MONEY>17 cents</MONEY> a pound from <PERCENT>10.6%</PERCENT> because the jackets had
small strips of corduroy trim on the sleeves. Customs ruled
that the strips, amounting to roughly <PERCENT>2%</PERCENT> of the jacket's
composition, changed the tariff category from "garments
designed for rainwear, hunting, fishing, or similar uses"
(such as skiing) to "other girls' wearing apparel, not
ornamented."
   Famous <ORGANIZATION>Raincoat Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the importer, appealed the Customs
ruling to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Court of International Trade</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Judge Kenton
Musgrave</PERSON> observed, "During the trial, government counsel . .
. relied on the `philosophical' meaning of the word `or' . .
. as opposed to `and.' " The judge threw out the government's
case and ordered Customs to refund the tariff surcharge.
   -- Shoes. More than 3,600 of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>'s 8,753 tariff
categories are restricted by import quotas. When Customs'
decisions change a product's tariff classification from
unrestricted to restricted, the ruling can effectively ban
imports. In <DATE>1989</DATE>, a Customs inspector decreed that a box of
athletic shoes could not contain an extra pair of
shoestrings. Shoestring imports are covered by textile import
quotas; Customs' decision, by requiring importers to have a
federal license to import the extra shoestrings, blocked the
import of tens of thousands of athletic shoes from <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>. None
of the athletic shoe importers were thinking of the extra
shoestrings as anything but part of the athletic shoes, many
of which had eyelets for more than one set of shoestrings.
   Customs modified the ruling in <DATE>1990</DATE>, permitting an extra
pair of strings as long as the extra shoestrings were laced
into the athletic shoes and were color coordinated with the
shoe. But Customs warned importers, "We note that where
multiple pairs of laces of like colors and/or designs are
imported . . . a presumption is raised" that the shoelaces
are not actually part of the shoe.
   -- Lingerie. The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government has been drubbed in
repeated court battles for trying to block imports of
lingerie and nightgowns by claiming that the lingerie is
actually a blouse or long shirt. As the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Association of
Importers of Textiles and Apparel</ORGANIZATION> complained in <DATE>1988</DATE>,
"Customs resistance to a decision which distinguished
nightwear from daywear has left importers in limbo. Importers
who believe they are following the dictates of the Court
continue to have merchandise seized as non-complying."
   -- Steel. In the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> strong-armed 28 nations
into signing so-called Voluntary Restraint Agreements (VRAs)
to restrict their steel exports. Each <ORGANIZATION>VRA</ORGANIZATION> specified which
tariff classifications of steel would be restrained. Though
happy with the VRAs, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> steel industry was aghast at
the prospect of any freely imported steel remaining and
lobbied Customs to solve this problem.
   On <DATE>Dec. 6, 1988</DATE>, Customs reversed three previous rulings
dating back to <DATE>1974</DATE> and announced that it was reclassifying
steel wire rope with beckets from an uncontrolled tariff
category into a tariff classification restricted by the VRAs.
On <DATE>Aug. 31, 1989</DATE>, at the behest of <ORGANIZATION>Bethlehem Steel</ORGANIZATION>, Customs
reversed three rulings since <DATE>1978</DATE> and moved scroll-cut
tin-free steel sheet into a restricted tariff classification.
   -- Sweeteners. In the early <DATE>1980s</DATE>, Canadian firms were
exporting sugar-corn-sweetener blends to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> These
blends were <PERCENT>35%</PERCENT> cheaper than pure sugar, for which there are
quotas. The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government created a separate import quota
and classification for the blended product in <DATE>1985</DATE>. Even
though the quota limited Canadian sales to <PERCENT>2%</PERCENT> of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
market, the imports still gave heartburn to American sugar
growers. In <DATE>1988</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Cane Sugar Refiners Association</ORGANIZATION>
contacted its good friend, <PERSON>Sen. Jesse Helms</PERSON>; the <LOCATION>North
Carolina</LOCATION> Republican repeatedly called his good friend,
Customs Commissioner <PERSON>William von Raab</PERSON>, for sweet talk,
according to <PERSON>Greg Rushford</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Legal Times</ORGANIZATION>.
   In <DATE>early 1989</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Customs Service</ORGANIZATION> redefined sugar and
banned all Canadian blended imports. The first time Canadian
companies learned of the new sugar definition was when four
trucks carrying their products were stopped at the
U.S.-Canada border and prohibited from entering the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> The
Customs' change in definition devastated an <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> firm that
relied on the Canadian blend as its primary product, as <PERSON>Mr.
Rushford</PERSON> reported.
   The combination of thousands of tariff categories and
endless redefinitions of products is turning importing into a
crapshoot. Tariff classification disputes are the ultimate
"reductio ad absurdum" of enlightened `managed trade.' If the
government cannot even intelligently decide what an athletic
shoe or an item of lingerie is, how likely is it that
government trade restrictions will actually benefit <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>
as a nation?

'GAME' OF THROWING SNEAKERS ONTO WIRES FRUSTRATES RESIDENTS OF 'SHOE VILLAGE'

<TEXT>
<P>
A strange sight has remained unaltered for more than four months on a short 
<LOCATION>Highland Park</LOCATION> street that residents sarcastically call Shoe Village. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of tennis shoes -- old and new, expensive and cheap -- hang by their 
laces from utility wires crisscrossing <ORGANIZATION>Sycamore Park Drive</ORGANIZATION>, a modest, 
ethnically mixed one-block, dead-end street just east of the <LOCATION>Pasadena Freeway</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Some people say they throw old shoes up there because they get a kick out of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"All of my friends," said <PERSON>Sean Bumcrot</PERSON>, 17, "whenever their shoes get old, they 
hang 'em up there instead of throwing them in the trash." Bumcrot said he has 
hung two of his own pairs on the wires, the blue-and-yellow Nikes and the old 
white ones with the tongues hanging out. 
</P>
<P>
But there is an ugly side to it. Some shoes have been stolen from the front of 
houses of Asian immigrants who removed them before going inside. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family Victimized 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Ranee Jitdanai</PERSON>, a Thai immigrant and Buddhist who lives on <ORGANIZATION>Sycamore Park Drive</ORGANIZATION>, 
is one of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
Jitdanai said her family's shoes have been stolen three times this year, 24 
pairs in all. "And my children buy <ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION>, expensive shoes. Why can't they buy 
K mart shoes?" she asked, smiling sheepishly. 
</P>
<P>
For 17 years, since arriving in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Jitdanai</PERSON>, her husband and 
their two sons had left their shoes on a shelf on the porch before entering 
their house, immaculately decorated with Thai dolls and sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
Now they put them in a cardboard box in a corner of the living room, leaving 
only a few old pairs worn for gardening on the porch. 
</P>
<P>
Bumcrot knows all about the thefts. His friends do it, although not him, he 
said. "That's why they stopped leaving their shoes outside," he said 
matter-of-factly, referring to the Jitdanais. The thieves keep good shoes and 
heave worn-out ones onto the wires, he said. 
</P>
<P>
His friends, <PERSON>Bumcrot</PERSON> said, also stole shoes from two other families that live 
in the block, immigrants from <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. Both families refused comment. 
</P>
<P>
Jitdanai, a nurse at <ORGANIZATION>Sycamore Hospital</ORGANIZATION> who declined to be photographed, said: 
"I don't want any enemies. I have two children in high school." 
</P>
<P>
That same fear has kept the friendly, soft-spoken woman from filing complaints 
with police even though, in addition to the shoe thefts, someone recently 
smashed her car windshield, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some neighbors are baffled at the apparent lack of interest from public 
officials. They complain that the shoes are unsightly, create a hazard by 
overloading the cable and signal the urban decay that attracts undesirables. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why they do it," <PERSON>Maria Cervantes</PERSON>, one of the neighbors, said of 
the shoe-throwers. "It looks ugly. I tell the boys not to do it again, but what 
else can I do? The policeman walks by and doesn't care." 
</P>
<P>
Another neighbor, who requested anonymity, said he contacted the <ORGANIZATION>Department of 
Water and Power</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Bell</ORGANIZATION> and field representatives of <LOCATION>Los Angeles City</LOCATION> 
Councilman <PERSON>Richard Alatorre</PERSON> four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
A utility crew promptly removed about 30 pairs of shoes from a power line, 
neighbors said. But <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Bell</ORGANIZATION> never responded, the man said, and neither did 
the councilman's office. 
</P>
<P>
The man said he first contacted <PERSON>Alatorre</PERSON>'s field representative, <PERSON>Shirley 
Minser</PERSON>, four months ago and made a follow-up call to <ORGANIZATION>Alatorre Deputy Rosa 
Morales</ORGANIZATION> a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
Minser said she did not recall receiving a complaint. "I'm sorry I didn't act 
on it, but I don't even remember it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Morales, though, acknowledged receiving the call. "I'm trying to find out what 
phone company to contact," she said. "Is it Southwest or Pacific Bell?"

STUDENT DESIGNS FOR A POWER-PACKED AUDIENCE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
What started seven years ago as a table-top fashion show at the <ORGANIZATION>Hard Rock Cafe</ORGANIZATION> 
has evolved into a black-tie, standing-room-only, theatrical event of epic 
proportions. 
</P>
<P>
The Seventh Annual Critics Awards Show for the <ORGANIZATION>Otis Art Institute of Parsons 
School of Design</ORGANIZATION> was staged in the International Ballroom of the <ORGANIZATION>Beverly Hilton 
Hotel</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. 
</P>
<P>
It was a zany and enlightening look at the future, as well as the past and 
present, of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> fashion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
90-Minute Show 
</P>
<P>
The students themselves represented the future. Twenty graduating seniors and 
20 juniors showed their accomplishments in a 90-minute fashion show. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't come up with any startling new ideas. Rather, they seemed to be 
imitating their critics' tastes and collections, possibly stifling their own, 
brave, new fashion inventions in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Menswear designs, although classically inclined, showed the most imagination. 
Adult and child versions of boxy jackets worn with walking shorts were witty 
yet wearable. Some unexpected pattern mixes -- checks, stripes and dots -- 
looked new. Other notables were walking-short suits, vests in unusual shapes, 
and a pair of trousers cropped at mid-calf that made them look intentionally 
too short. 
</P>
<P>
To a greater extent than ever, the school is a recruiting ground for new 
talent. And the audience reflected the trend. It was dotted with fashion 
retailers from both coasts, including <ORGANIZATION>Industry Committee</ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON>Robert 
Mettler</PERSON>, president and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION>Robinson's</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Karen Gould</PERSON>, 
whose husband, <PERSON>Michael</PERSON>, is president of <PERSON>Giorgio Beverly Hills</PERSON>, was the 
evening's benefit chair. 
</P>
<P>
From <ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdale</ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> came vice president <PERSON>Barbara Kennedy</PERSON>, along with 
several store buyers. 
</P>
<P>
After <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>'s show there was a silent auction at which many of the 
student designs were sold. <PERSON>Fred Hayman</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Rodeo Drive</ORGANIZATION> boutique that carries 
his name placed bids of <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> each on four evening outfits. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, <ORGANIZATION>Nordstrom</ORGANIZATION> was the first retail store to sponsor a student award at 
<PERSON>Otis Parsons</PERSON> and carry student designs in the store's junior department. 
</P>
<P>
The evening's honored guest was <PERSON>Elois Jenssen</PERSON>, who designed all of the late 
<PERSON>Lucille Ball</PERSON>'s costumes for the "I Love Lucy" show. 
</P>
<P>
After a fantasy skit that featured her work for Ball, she was presented the 
Design Achievement Award, which had been planned for a year. The comedian's 
recent death made the remembrance particularly poignant. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd hushed to pin-drop level when a recording of Lucy's voice filled the 
room. 
</P>
<P>
As for <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> present, that was represented by the designer-teachers who 
worked with this year's students. Their names are among the best known in the 
<LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> contemporary fashion market. <PERSON>Leon Max</PERSON>, <PERSON>Karl Logan</PERSON>, <PERSON>Nancy Heller</PERSON>, 
<PERSON>Robin Piccone</PERSON> of Body Glove, <PERSON>George Machado</PERSON> for Zylos, <PERSON>Gary Nickerson</PERSON> for La 
Blanca swimwear and Tadashi and <PERSON>Eugene Rodriquez</PERSON> for <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s among them. All 
served as "student guides" and critics this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Big Winner 
</P>
<P>
Despite the big business and Hollywood overtones of the evening, the awards 
themselves are still the main event for students and their guests. And this 
year's big winner was <PERSON>Mitra Rajabi</PERSON> for the coveted Designer of the Year Award. 
In addition, 12 students received Golden Thimble Awards for excellence in 
specific fashion projects directed by a designer. 
</P>
<P>
The Thimbles went to <PERSON>Rebecca Kaufman</PERSON> for her <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION> shoe; <PERSON>Magali Juelle</PERSON> for her 
<PERSON>Stuart Weitzman</PERSON> evening slipper; <PERSON>Paula Corely</PERSON> for her Jocelyn Winship/Body 
Glove Menswear sleek cycling look; <PERSON>Nomi Saraj</PERSON> for her Body Glove Swimwear black 
neoprene bikini and skirt; <PERSON>Jaymie Harris</PERSON> for her La Blanca swimwear hooded 
maillot; <PERSON>Alice Bonner</PERSON> for her <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s oversized varsity jacket look; <PERSON>Tracy 
Meagher</PERSON> for her <ORGANIZATION>Nordstrom</ORGANIZATION> young junior separates; <PERSON>Sally Yuk Wa Chan</PERSON> for her 
Zylos menswear shorts suit; <PERSON>Duncan McKenzie</PERSON> for his Karl <LOCATION>Logan</LOCATION> red pantsuit; 
<PERSON>Jon Murata</PERSON> for his <PERSON>Leon Max</PERSON> fit-and-flare chocolate-brown wrap coat; <PERSON>Sharon 
Chang</PERSON> for her <PERSON>Nancy Heller</PERSON> English-dandy looks; <PERSON>Sergio Kracer</PERSON> for his 
Tadashi/Bloomingdale's black-lace cocktail dress. 
</P>
<P>
Other Awards included the <ORGANIZATION>USA/USSR Design for Peace Team Award</ORGANIZATION>, given to <PERSON>Magali 
Juelle</PERSON>, <PERSON>Christopher Ma</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mitra Rajabi</PERSON>; the <ORGANIZATION>National Assn. of Menswear Buyer</ORGANIZATION>'s 
Award given to <PERSON>Alice Bonner</PERSON>; the <ORGANIZATION>Mens Apparel Guild</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Award given 
to <PERSON>Christopher Ma</PERSON>; and the <ORGANIZATION>Mizuno International Sportswear Design</ORGANIZATION> competition 
given to <PERSON>Mitra Rajabi</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
The event raised <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> for the school.

<DESCRIPT>  FASHION; YEAR; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  FASHION designers welcomed the first year of the '90s by resurrecting the
'60s, causing women who'd been there before to wince and others to roll up the
waistbands of their already short skirts and wonder if false eyelashes, too,
would make a comeback.;    Those same designers also took a look around at
what real people -- not clotheshorses -- were actually wearing, and gave a
twist to "street fashion" by turning things such as parkas and hooded sweat
shirts, stretchy bicycle shorts, waist-slung belt bags and all manner of
functional sportswear into "high fashion."  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  THE YEAR IN FASHION
NO DOMINANT '90 TREND, EXCEPT HIGH PRICES  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Style  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Everybody moaned about the high cost of clothes, then went right out and
bought whatever it was they considered essential in their lives: yet another
pair of dangly earrings; a <PERSON>Barbara Bush</PERSON> fake pearl choker; a <PERSON>Bart Simpson</PERSON>
T-shirt; expensive running or walking or aerobic or basketball or
cross-trainer athletic shoes; a long, long jacket; or maybe even something in
a bright color for a change.;    It was not a year when only one look or idea
dominated women's fashion or when a new or renewed trend or fad blotted out
everything else.;    Ironically, the new women's clothes that were added to
many a mainstream wardrobe were based on ideas that first appeared on European
runways in '88 and '89.;    The fashions that looked weird and elicited scorn
and "who's going to wear that stuff?" back then started looking fairly normal
when they showed up on women riding the bus, sitting at the next desk, dining
at the next table in the same restaurant: long jackets or great big sweaters
with tights -- and nothing else; over-the-knee boots; dressy shorts worn with
hose and a jacket for jobs or social events; embroidered, sequined,
embellished everything; and, yes, even short skirts.;    The surprise
successes of the <DATE>fall</DATE> season were what <ORGANIZATION>Neiman Marcus</ORGANIZATION> vice president and
fashion director <PERSON>Joan Kaner</PERSON> calls "second skins," referring to all types of
stretch body coverings -- leggings, stirrups, catsuits -- that were strong
sellers at all price levels. They were the cover-ups, literally, that helped a
lot of women ease into shorter skirts or newer looks by offering coverage and
doing away with the appearance of naked legs.;    But if there was one item
that said "fashion" in <DATE>1990</DATE>, it was the jacket. Women who already owned a
bunch of them added one more -- a long, long, lean one by, or more likely,
inspired by <PERSON>Giorgio Armani</PERSON>. Others latched on to all sorts of variations of
Chanel-styled jackets, particularly those in plaids or sporting some type of
quilting.;    By far, these two designers -- <LOCATION>Milan</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Armani</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Chanel</ORGANIZATION>'s Karl
Lagerfeld -- continued to be the most influential in the realm of women's
clothing: <PERSON>Armani</PERSON> for his understated, comfortable and easy clothes, along with
his muted and mellow colors; Lagerfeld for everything from jackets and tights
to tiny bags, wide headbands and wigs.;    The name that gained added
recognition among fashion followers during the past year was that of Parisian
<PERSON>Claude Montana</PERSON>, sure to be an increasingly potent force in the future with his
sleek and modern clothes.;    Among American designers, <PERSON>Donna Karan</PERSON> continued
to do phenomenal business, especially with her <ORGANIZATION>DKNY</ORGANIZATION> collection of sporty
clothes. Though this line is supposedly moderately priced, many of her fervid
fans add a treasured piece or two only after vigilantly watching for "sale"
signs, then pouncing when a markdown makes something affordable.;    At year's
end, <PERSON>Karan</PERSON> was named women's fashion designer of the year by the <ORGANIZATION>Council of
Fashion Designers</ORGANIZATION>, while a youngster, 21-year-old <PERSON>Christian Francis Roth</PERSON>, was
awarded the council's "new talent" prize for his whimsical clothes based on
children's playthings -- Crayola sleeves, tick-tack-toe pockets.;    The year
ended with the promise that the dress was making a comeback, something that
women will decide when they start buying <DATE>spring</DATE> clothes -- if they do.;    In
men's clothing, it was pattern that made an impact. Though ponytails and
slouchy suits and spicy colors caught on with some individualists and the
fashion forward, by far the biggest thing to hit the widest audience was the
patterned -- or the "important" -- tie.;    Teens into "looks" focused on
their heads and their feet: Big hair, no hair, colored hair, partially shaved
heads, box cuts and baseball caps vied for attention with clunky <PERSON>Doc Martens</PERSON>,
any big black shoes or canvas shoes -- especially high-tops with different
colored laces that are never, never, ever laced.  </TEXT>

RICHARD EDER: THE FIRE THIS TIME; 
</P>
<P>
PHILADELPHIA FIRE BY JOHN EDGAR WIDEMAN (HENRY HOLT: $19.95; 199 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bloodiest and -- relative to the level of disorder that provoked it -- most 
violent government repression ever undertaken in an American urban black 
community was the helicopter bombing of a <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> slum house in <DATE>1985</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The house was occupied by MOVE, a Rastafarian-like commune that had resisted 
repeated municipal orders to vacate. The group was armed, and some level of 
force was required to accomplish the eviction. It turned out to be a 
mini-holocaust. The bomb killed 11 commune members, including five children, 
and burned down 53 houses. 
</P>
<P>
That horror provides the central imagery of the agonized fictional meditations 
and variations that make up "<LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> Fire." <PERSON>John Edgar Wideman</PERSON>'s novel is 
a blaze of rage, but what makes the blaze hotter and the book more stunning is 
the despair that lies under it. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor <PERSON>Wilson Goode</PERSON>, who ordered the bombing, is black. He was elected in the 
hope that <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, with its prosperity and strong civic and cultural 
traditions, might be the city where black voices and white resources could come 
together to reverse the spiral of urban decay and racial degradation. 
</P>
<P>
The cruel irony of <ORGANIZATION>Goode</ORGANIZATION>'s decision provides <PERSON>Wideman</PERSON>, our most powerful and 
accomplished artist of the urban black world, with a theme so overwhelming and 
painful that it threatens to burst his throat. Sometimes it does, and his voice 
splinters and becomes inchoate. Sometimes, <PERSON>Wideman</PERSON>'s genius for impassioned 
imagery triumphs and "<LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> Fire" delivers its message with a careening 
momentum and astonishing precision. 
</P>
<P>
If the telling is multifarious and passionate, the theme is straightforward and 
harsh. There is a narrator figure who, much like <PERSON>Wideman</PERSON> -- a <LOCATION>Rhodes</LOCATION> scholar, 
acclaimed writer and professor -- managed to rise out of disadvantage, thanks 
to talent, struggle and the opportunities that the '60s briefly opened. The 
thought was that such individual successes would in some fashion bring a whole 
people along. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of a rising tide lifting all boats, a few rising boats were supposed to 
raise the ocean. For the achievers, the hope seemed genuine, despite uneasiness 
at enjoying the benefits of being its chosen instrument. Such uneasiness has 
flavored <PERSON>Wideman</PERSON>'s books, and given them edge, anger and art. 
</P>
<P>
Now he uses the <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> fire as the turning point, the end of the road. It 
stands, dramatically, for the less dramatic and more lethal turning of the last 
dozen years. Instead of tentatively holding out their hands, the privileged 
classes were encouraged to tuck them back in their pockets. And <PERSON>Wideman</PERSON>'s black 
mayor, who thought he was to deliver his people, bombed them instead. 
</P>
<P>
Whether it was a forced choice, in view of MOVE's violent resistance, and 
whether a white mayor would have felt empowered to make it, are debated 
questions. Whether any mayor would have ordered such a bombing in a 
middle-class white neighborhood, and if he had, whether the neighboring houses 
would have been so wretched and flimsy as to burn up, seems much less 
debatable. 
</P>
<P>
Do you try to join a society that is ready to bomb you? The question splits the 
narrator in two. One half is <PERSON>Wideman</PERSON>, writing and teaching in western 
<LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>. The other half is a figure named Cudjoe, who represents a 
Wideman in transition from a belief in peaceable means to a hesitant, 
despairing identification with extremes. Cudjoe lives in a comfortable literary 
exile in <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION>; news of the fire sets him on a voyage of discovery back to 
<LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
An image drives him. A boy named <PERSON>Simba</PERSON> was briefly spotted fleeing from the 
burning house, and subsequently disappeared. Cudjoe thinks of Simba -- he 
visualizes him caught in the cross-hairs of a policeman's sniper-scope -- as 
part of himself. And <PERSON>Wideman</PERSON>, in his own voice, reminds us of his own real son, 
jailed for a killing and seemingly lost to his father's world of achievement. 
Success is a fraud if you cannot bring your children too. 
</P>
<P>
"Fire" tells of Cudjoe/Wideman's search. He talks to <PERSON>Margaret Jones</PERSON>, one of the 
"slaves" of King, the leader and prophet of MOVE. He talks to <ORGANIZATION>Timbo</ORGANIZATION>, a former 
classmate now ensconced in power -- and bitterness -- as an aide to the mayor. 
He talks to the young men hanging around the neighborhood basketball court. And 
he recalls or imagines others: a white publisher who helped him get into print, 
members of a violent gang of boys for whom Simba is symbol and hero, and a 
ragged, picaresque wanderer named J. B. who also seems to be the dead King. 
</P>
<P>
It is a swirl of stories, images and voices. Some burn indelibly. <PERSON>Wideman</PERSON> has 
made fire his own, and there are fire figures everywhere, illuminating us and 
driving us back with heat and smoky confusion. 
</P>
<P>
There is the clotted, dreadlocked J. B. roaming implacably through the business 
district, begging, singing rap songs and transfixing the city's prosperous 
heedlessness like a risen <PERSON>Lazarus</PERSON>. Even more memorable is <PERSON>Margaret Jones</PERSON>' 
account of coming under the spell of King. 
</P>
<P>
An office worker with "my little bit of degree," determined to keep her place 
clean and rear her two children decently, she is repelled when she first sees 
King lounging in front of his house. He has J. B.'s dreadlocks, filth and 
stink. He is everything she abhors. Yet after a month or so, she is living with 
him. Her mother spent her life on aching feet, working as a maid and cleaning 
up for white folks. King's blazing defiance suddenly shows her that she is 
simply a better-paid maid. Her feet still hurt. "He got to me through my feet," 
she says. "Though he did it wrong, he did it right." 
</P>
<P>
Feet are <PERSON>Wideman</PERSON>'s recurring sign; the most literal image of oppression. An 
oppressed body discharges its burden on its feet. In an extraordinary passage, 
the author describes a mound of sneakers beside a city fountain where the slum 
kids go to cool off. 
</P>
<P>
They are beat-up, "the way kids' shoes always are, but these scattered around 
on the wet steps, these were worse, gaping holes in the bottoms, shredded 
uppers, laces missing, shoes taped, patched, lined with cardboard. Cheapest 
concoctions of glue and foam and canvas that money could buy." 
</P>
<P>
But a lot of money. The ad-driven status symbol that exploits poverty and 
despair while seeming to promise that you can jog right away from them. And in 
a tremendous extrapolation, Cudjoe: 
</P>
<P>
". . . constructs a room to match the shoes, fills it with sleeping bodies, 
many funky pairs of sneakers set out overnight to dry. Constructs a row house 
to hold the room, matches it with house after house till there is a street, 
then a neighborhood matching the sorry-assed shoes he's ready to lace now and 
thinks of miles of streets he must negotiate to reach the fountain, how pebbles 
and grains of glass punch through the thin soles, how after walking awhile with 
his brothers and sisters in tow, it's like walking barefoot on burning coals, 
you don't stop and wait for a light to change, you charge through 
intersections, daring cars to hit you. Constructs a city to hold the 
neighborhood. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Cudjoe never finds <PERSON>Simba</PERSON> but the mayor's aide, <ORGANIZATION>Timbo</ORGANIZATION>, tells him about <PERSON>Simba</PERSON>'s 
disciples, a gang of 15- and 16-year-olds that calls itself the Kiddie Kars 
Korps -- or <ORGANIZATION>KKK</ORGANIZATION>. (We will think of the <PERSON>Ku Klux Klan</PERSON> and register <PERSON>Wideman</PERSON>'s 
savage irony.) They wild around the city. Their target is adults. In scrawled 
flyers -- did they write them? did some adult radical or police provocateur? -- 
they proclaim that the world belongs to them; that "olds" must be killed, 
robbed and exiled to islands. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything for the young," is their slogan, <PERSON>Timbo</PERSON> explains. "It's fair, they 
say, because everybody's young once. And nobody has to grow old if they don't 
want to." It is a bitter twist. Adults have eaten their children's seed corn 
and denied them decent schools and jobs, and made a profit by selling them 
drugs. Many of the young never will grow old, but not because they don't want 
to. They have no choice. 
</P>
<P>
It is in passages like these that <PERSON>Wideman</PERSON>'s book comes to its burning focus. 
Elsewhere it rambles, clumsy and sometimes indecipherable. When he writes of a 
<LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> vacation, of Cudjoe's troubled marriage, of the book editor, his control 
wavers; mainly, perhaps, because his heart doesn't seem to be in it. A long 
section about staging "The Tempest" with a cast of slum children has a 
diffuseness, even a sentimentality, that overwhelms a rather academic point 
about <PERSON>Caliban</PERSON> as the symbol of black oppression. 
</P>
<P>
Wideman holds nothing back. The unevenness, the repetitiveness, the partial 
chaos of "Fire" are, in a sense, the embodiment of his theme. An authentic 
culture is entangled and choked in a culture that is superimposed. The book can 
be as ungainly as <PERSON>Caliban</PERSON> or the dreadlocked King. The defect may be partly 
willed, but it is a defect in any case; a form that struggles to encompass its 
theme and often fails. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the successes are indelible. Wideman offers himself as a casualty of the 
struggle, but he is its victor as well.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Fashion: Best foot (fetish) forward - Imelda Marcos had a
shoe hoard which shocked the world. But, says Brenda Polan, some women
understood why . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRENDA POLAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The young woman in the wine bar was furious. Shoes were the problem. She
had, she told her friends, searched and searched and not a shoe shop in
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> had anything for sale that she wanted to buy.
They were full of platforms; hideous, ugly, clumping, frightful, unsexy,
horrid platforms. Nothing nice, she reiterated, as she gazed fondly at her
well-polished spike-heeled courts, amid mutters of passionate agreement from
the friends. One began to fantasise about a lynch mob teetering into
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s stores to demand nice shoes. Lots of them.
Shoes can arouse strong passions. When the democratic masses liberated
<PERSON>Imelda Marcos</PERSON>'s formidable wardrobe in the presidential palace in <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>,
they were deeply shocked by her 3,000 pairs of shoes.
For the Filipinos, and for the world, those shoes became the symbol of greed
and excess. But, as puritans, moralists and right-thinking people exclaimed
in disgust, some remained silent. Many women could understand Imelda. After
all, some knew that their own closets were crammed with shoes. Given
Imelda's ill-gotten resources, who is to say that they too would not have
managed to accumulate a similar number? Some women have a shoe thing. It is
not really a guilty secret. It is just that talking about it tends to cause
men a disproportionate amount of distress. But among themselves certain
women are open about their shoe habits.
'I'm a shoe fetishist,' says <PERSON>Elaine Paige</PERSON>, the singer. 'I have a real fetish
for shoes,' says TV personality <PERSON>Gloria Hunniford</PERSON> defiantly. 'I have a mega
fetish about shoes,' explains <PERSON>Ulrika Jonsson</PERSON>, a television presenter. 'I'm a
shoe fanatic,' is how designer <PERSON>Edina Ronay</PERSON> puts it. 'I'm a complete
shoeaholic,' jokes actress <PERSON>Kate Hardie</PERSON>.
'I've got about 25 pairs, not counting dancing shoes,' says <PERSON>Darcy Bussell</PERSON>,
the ballerina. 'I have about 50 pairs,' says actress <PERSON>Tara Fitzgerald</PERSON>. 'About
100 pairs,' guesses <PERSON>Gloria Estefan</PERSON>, singer.
'I own about 200 pairs,' says <PERSON>Belinda Carlisle</PERSON>, also a singer, without
hesitation. 'Let's just say,' says <PERSON>Charlene Tilton</PERSON>, a former star of <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>,
'that I understand Imelda. I have a whole wardrobe full of high-heeled
shoes.'
<PERSON>Greta Garbo</PERSON> once bought 70 pairs in the same style (but several colours).
<PERSON>Marlene Dietrich</PERSON>, who had hers made to measure by <PERSON>Ferragamo</PERSON>, reckoned that,
since a pair were worn out after two outings, a replacement had to be
ordered immediately. Why, when women can be infinitely cautious and
restrained when buying clothes, are they so inconsistent where shoes are
concerned?
There are several practical explanations. Unless a shoe is made-to-measure,
it is unlikely to fit perfectly. Those of us whose feet do not chance to
match a manufacturer's last, are engaged on an endless quest for comfort.
Given a co-operative sales assistant, a woman can try every shoe in the shop
in the time it takes to wriggle into three clothes outfits in a cramped
changing room. And she does not have to address the fact that a dress size
10 no longer appears to accommodate her hips. One's shoe size remains
reassuringly constant.
Then there is the fashion imperative. Or, as the shoe designer, <PERSON>Manolo
Blahnik</PERSON>, puts it: 'A fine shoe is an essential part of fashionable dress. It
can provide an accent to an outfit - whether witty, solemn, provocative or
simply elegant. Dress designers know that the right shoes are a crucial
ingredient to a successful look.'
And the wrong shoes can wreck an outfit. As fashion changes its proportions,
every element of dress changes. The woman in the wine bar was wearing a
tight mini skirt and a jacket with square shoulders. She had decided to pass
on long skirts and the soft, slender outline of <DATE>1993</DATE>, the look which demands
clumpy shoes and looks frumpy with spike-heeled court shoes. So she was
right about her needs.
Few of us are so impervious to fashion's swings. Most of us have clambered
aboard a pair of platforms. So, to a certain extent, women's shoe hoards
represent the detritus of their journeys along fashion's meandering highway.
Not so much a problem of rampant acquisition as one of never throwing away.
And yet there is more to it than that. When pressed, some women admit to
never wearing, indeed to never having worn even once, a high proportion of
their hoard. Pressed to show and tell, these women will tenderly unwrap
delicate, pointy-heeled confections of shiny leather, softest suede, satin,
grosgrain, leopardskin print, brocade or lace, all in deeply impractical
colours and adorned with bows, buckles, sequins, gilt or embroidery.
Women can use shoes to express (and then hastily banish to the back of the
cupboard) a fantasy self. This self is simultaneously ultra feminine,
fragile, refined and a total vamp.
Not that these shoes are the stuff that true shoe fetishists' (always male
and usually masochistic) dreams are made of. They do not have to be. For
reasons that psychiatrists, psychologists and fashion historians are all
unable to fathom, the female foot and its shoe are erotically charged.
When, in the <DATE>1970s</DATE>, <PERSON>William A. Rossi</PERSON> had a stab at solving the problem in
his book, The Sex Life of the Foot and Shoe, he concluded that there were
several factors at work. The intrinsic sensitivity of the feet (toe-sucking
apart, has anyone tickled yours recently?) makes them an area of sensuality.
Then there's <PERSON>Sigmund Freud</PERSON>'s argument that the foot is a phallic symbol.
There is also the way high heels affect the wearer's gait and posture,
emphasising the hips and buttocks, arching the back, thrusting the bosom
forward, lengthening the leg, tightening the calf muscle and focusing
attention on the ankle.
Fragile ankles and small feet are feminine and, in terms of dress, anything
which reinforces gender differences is sexy. Unfortunately, nowadays most
women have comparatively large feet and sturdy ankles.
Perhaps the endless quest for shoes is, in fact, the endless quest for
ideally feminine feet and ankles.
But there is a new element. The female executive's <DATE>1980s</DATE> 'power' uniform was
incomplete without her high, high heels.
As she strode out, hips swinging, she felt in control, autonomous, truly
powerful. There is no rule that says you cannot invest an old accessory with
new symbolism and then feel undermined when the symbol is snatched away from
you.
Significantly, when the <PERSON>Michael Douglas</PERSON> character in The War of the Roses
decided to whip his uppity wife into line, he invaded her punctiliously
ordered closet and, leering horribly, sawed the heels off all her many
shoes.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Fashion: Iron styling puts lingerie on top - A tailored
jacket and black metal jewellery are perfect to set off the slip-dress as it
comes come out of the boudoir
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MULVAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Visualise the counterpoint of iron and lace, specifically, the chiaroscuro
of black <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> iron jewellery resting on white skin dressed in lambent
satin edged with lace.
For the past two seasons, the American designer <PERSON>Donna Karan</PERSON> has been showing
slips in silk satin - but these slips are not for the boudoir, they are to
be worn as day dresses under neat, plain, tailored jackets. The look is a
natural continuation of <PERSON>Karan</PERSON>'s exploration of ways to soften a woman's
wardrobe after the shard-sharp assertiveness of working women's clothes in
the <DATE>1980s</DATE>.
Her bronze satin slip-dress at Pounds 520 and tweed jacket at Pounds 1,075
are available at <PERSON>Brown</PERSON>'s in <LOCATION>South Molton Street</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> W1, and those who
love the <PERSON>Donna Karan</PERSON> look can spend huge sums on buying the original.
However, women on a tight budget will find it is the idea that matters, and
it is worth browsing round the lingerie shops (<PERSON>Janet Reger</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Rigby &amp; Peller</ORGANIZATION>,
<PERSON>Fenwick</PERSON>'s and <PERSON>Janet Whiteman</PERSON> at weekends in the Covent Garden market), where
petticoats and slips can be found for between Pounds 22 and Pounds 29.
Team them with neat, trim-waisted and tailored jackets. It is important to
juxtapose the boudoir tone of the lingerie with the propriety of the
tailored jacket if this look is to work outside the bedroom.
Put together carelessly, it could appear that you had forgotten your skirt
or - worse - leave you looking like a streetwalker. So choose accessories
carefully. Wear fine, skin-toned hosiery, such as <ORGANIZATION>Wolford</ORGANIZATION>'s 10-denier
'Individual'. Absolutely sheer tights look tarty; opaque ones too heavy.
Choose gossamer-light shoes to give the impression that you are barely shod.
<ORGANIZATION>Russell &amp; Bromley</ORGANIZATION> has an extensive range of pretty, strappy and ribbon-tied
high sandals this season in black, bronze, silver, gold and pink, for about
Pounds 100.
Your jacket should be understated. Avoid loud, gilt buttons or 'novelty'
details. If you are reviving an old, tailored jacket, replace the gilt with
dressmakers' buttons of the same tone as the cloth or, if you cannot find
them, modest mother-of-pearl ones. Above all, grooming should be bandbox
smart and classic: that tousled 'just out of bed' style and lashings of
make-up will only induce unwelcome attention.
The new, on-the-knee length of skirt is perfect - too short, baby-doll
style, looks comical. Avoid transparency, too much lace or too many bows and
ruffles. Keep it simple.
The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> has a particularly wonderful lingerie department. The
workmanship on its embroidered slips is exquisite and there is the added
thrill of receiving your lingerie in a big, white shiny box, lettered in
gold and fastened with ribbons, which, if you live in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, is delivered
to your door free of charge by an old retainer driving a green and gold van.
Such delicacy needs finely crafted jewellery to set it off. Berlin Iron,
which imitates the filigree effect of black lace, has a compelling history.
In <DATE>1804</DATE> the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Prussian Iron Foundry</ORGANIZATION> introduced the jewellery as a
sideline. During the Prussian War of Liberation in <DATE>1813</DATE>, aristocrats who had
sacrificed their diamonds and pearls for the war coffers, donned this
patriotic jewellery to proclaim their loyalty in the fight against <PERSON>Napoleon</PERSON>.
Grand duchesses and countesses appeared at political salons and country
house parties wearing black inscribed rings in place of their wedding rings,
and steel cameos depicting the profiles of their war heroes wreathed in
Roman-style laurels.
European ladies swooned with envy, for the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Foundry</ORGANIZATION> and its fellow
steelworks - <PERSON>Trier</PERSON> on the <LOCATION>Moselle</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>, Gleiwitz in <LOCATION>Silesia</LOCATION>, and Count
Stolberg-Wernigerode's at Ilsenburg in the <LOCATION>Hartz mountains</LOCATION> - refused to
disclose how it was done for several decades.
At the <ORGANIZATION>Great Exhibition</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Crystal Palace</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> in <DATE>1851</DATE>, English
craftsmen speculated about the iron's composition. Had phosphorus been added
to the molten iron in the casting process? Perhaps the Germans used iron
without graphite; perhaps it was the inordinately high temperatures of the
charcoal-fired furnaces that allowed such precision? Would-be imitators were
confused and maddened.
Berlin iron was never diminished by the description 'imitation jewellery'.
It was far too defined and demanded such artistry and skill. That the iron
of canons could be turned into fine foliated scrolls, and gothic motifs had
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> marvelling at its strange beauty. Even the enemy <PERSON>Napoleon</PERSON> dispatched
patterns from <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> in <DATE>1806</DATE> to be copied.
By <DATE>1860</DATE> its moment had passed. Nickel alloys circulated as poor cousins and
the sacrificial notion was briefly revived during the first world war by the
Germans, but its heyday was gone.
Perhaps the strength of iron, lying lightly on a whisper of lace is the way
to reflect the strong and the gentle side of a woman this <DATE>winter</DATE>.

<LEADPARA>  FOR once, getting a leg up on fashion doesn't require skipping a mortgage
payment.;    Leggings -- tights that end above the ankle -- just keep gaining
in popularity. Popular with dancers for years, they moved easily into the
world of exercise wear before teens recognized their inherent fashion quotient
and started tugging on leggings in place of pants.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  THE NEW PANTS OF THE 1990'S
LEGGINGS ARE A COMFORTABLE, VERSATILE AND
USUALLY INEXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Style  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     This true "street" fashion has since been enthusiastically embraced by
adult women, little girls and the design establishment. They're hot now and
they're hot for <DATE>fall</DATE>, where they are a foundation for many key looks.;   
"Leggings are the pants of the '90s," says <PERSON>Sarah Hoskins</PERSON>, spokeswoman for Hue,
a major manufacturer whose products are carried in more than 5,000 stores
across the country. In the <DATE>past two years</DATE>, sales of leggings have increased <PERCENT>35
percent</PERCENT>, <PERSON>Hoskins</PERSON> says.;    Prices start at around <MONEY>$10</MONEY> -- not bad, when you
consider a pair of leggings often makes half an outfit. Of course, prices go
up from there, but for under <MONEY>$30</MONEY> you can find just about any look you want --
from solid colors to <LOCATION>Pucci</LOCATION> pattern knock-offs. And if you simply must run up
your charges, there are luxury leggings in velvet that cost <MONEY>$75.</MONEY>;    Aside
from the comfort factor, the appeal of leggings is that they create a slim
look on most women -- particularly if you pair black leggings with an
over-size shirt, sweater or jacket that hits at mid-thigh.;    Here are some
tips for maximizing the leggings look:;    (box) Solid colors are more
slimming than patterns. If you've got long, lean legs you can wear whatever
you like, but if your legs aren't your best feature, stick to solids.;   
(box) Don't buy a pair of patterned leggings without trying them on first and
taking a good look in the mirror. That pretty pattern may stretch into a
not-so-pretty blur.;    (box) If you really like the idea of a pattern, look
for small rather than large prints, subtle rather than psychedelic colors or
lace -- which will give you both a pattern and a solid color.;    (box) If
your hips are as slim as your ankles, you can pair leggings with short tops.
If not, stick with long tops that cover any bulges or rolls.;    (box) For
day, flats or sandals are the perfect footwear. Ballet-slipper flats are
ideal.;    (box) For evening, heels can work but it's a tricky combination.
Again, take a long look in the mirror to make sure the heels, leggings and top
all work together.;    While leggings aren't for every woman, tights are. If
the idea of a break between your pants and shoes makes you uncomfortable, a
heavy pair of tights works just as well as leggings.;    In fact, designer
<PERSON>Louis Dell'Olio</PERSON> is telling people his innovative pant boots and pant heels (a
pair is pictured on the cover of today's Living section) came about in part as
a solution for the woman who doesn't like to expose her ankle. They also are
an alternative to the early-morning ritual of finding the right shade of
hosiery to go with both your shoes and your outfit.;    However, unlike
leggings, the pant boots <ORGANIZATION>Dell</ORGANIZATION>'Olio designed for the fall <PERSON>Anne Klein</PERSON> collection
are equal to a mortgage payment. Pant boots in simple stretch velvet sell for
<MONEY>$450</MONEY> and the dressier rhinestone-encrusted pant boots cost <MONEY>$1,200</MONEY>.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   For a time <DATE>Monday</DATE> the most pressing
question for some of the highest officials of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government
was: Which ones are my shoes?
   The top poohbahs of the <ORGANIZATION>Bush White House</ORGANIZATION> had to leave their shoes
at the door when they lunched in the pleasant wooden surroundings of
the <ORGANIZATION>Ever Spring House</ORGANIZATION> on the grounds of the <ORGANIZATION>Blue House</ORGANIZATION>, the
fortified residence of Korean presidents.
   That's Korean tradition. No problem.
   But when lunch was over there they were, in a neat row, the nine
pairs of nearly identical black slip-on shoes that clearly are
favored by the upper crust of the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> team.
   Which were Secretary of State <PERSON>James Baker</PERSON>'s and which were Chief
of Staff <PERSON>John Sununu</PERSON>'s? Which belonged to <PERSON>Brent Scowcroft</PERSON>, the
temporarily shoeless national security adviser, and which to <PERSON>Gaston
Sigur</PERSON>, the assistant secretary of state?
   With all the dignity they could command, they stood on the porch
of the <ORGANIZATION>Ever Spring House</ORGANIZATION>, long-handled shoehorns in hand, figuring
out which shoes belonged to which feet.
   They did it, and were shod in time for the formal ceremony ending
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s talk and lunch with President <PERSON>Roh Tae-Woo</PERSON>, the former
four-star general who is <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s Korean counterpart.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> had no problem with his shoes. The presidential shoes were
the only ones of the American party that were laced, traditional
black wingtips.
   It didn't even matter, hoever, since a Korean aide whisked <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s
shoes inside at the last minute, sparing the president the need to
put them on in public.
   If shoes were a problem, so were legs, at lunch. The <ORGANIZATION>Ever Spring
House</ORGANIZATION> is a handsome Korean building of 52 red pine pillars, and the
meal served inside was equally traditional, including the sitting
arrangements.
   Sitting was on seats that lack legs. The president, who stands
6-feet-2, did not know quite where to put his feet that lacked shoes.
   So he asked his host, <PERSON>Roh</PERSON>, ``Do you put your legs straight out or
do you fold them up?'' The president of <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> showed the president
of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> how to fit his long legs under the low table.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was in <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> for a friendship stop on the way home from his
trip to the funeral of <PERSON>Emperor Hirohito</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and his visit to
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION>.
   He talked and lunched with <PERSON>Roh</PERSON> _ pumpkin porridge, three kinds of
fish, sliced marinated beef, dumpling soup, rice cakes and
milky-white Korean rice wine. But mostly he posed for pictures duing
his Korean visit of less than five hours.
   He posed at the airport, where Koreans waving paper flags held up
signs reading: ``Great Regard for <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>.''
   He posed with <PERSON>Roh</PERSON> upon arriving at the <ORGANIZATION>Blue House</ORGANIZATION>, and with <PERSON>Roh</PERSON>'s
wife, and when he signed the guest book. He posed during the talks,
photographers being allowed in in relays, assembly line fashion.
   He posed before lunch in the <ORGANIZATION>Ever Spring House</ORGANIZATION>, with his shoes
off. (The photographers were equally unshod.)
   He posed after lunch with <PERSON>Roh</PERSON> after both declared their talks a
great success in remarks written before the session started.
   At the <ORGANIZATION>National Assembly</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> posed with the assembly speaker
and the speaker's wife. Just a few more pictures at the airport with
members of the American community and <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was ready to head home.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> went by helicopter everywhere he traveled in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>. Parts of
the city, including near the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> and the university, saw
ugly police-demonstrator clashes, but the airborne <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> never laid
eyes on an angry Korean.

<P>
They're called baby dolls, but you won't find them hanging around the lingerie 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, many of them look like negligees, with their filmy, see-through fabrics, 
low necklines and thigh-high skirts, but these baby dolls aren't pajamas. 
</P>
<P>
Baby doll is a generic term for dresses that have full, flowing silhouettes. 
</P>
<P>
"Technically it's a float dress -- it floats from the body and it's usually 
real short," says <PERSON>Holly Sharp</PERSON>, a Costa Mesa-based fashion designer who has seen 
her line of baby dolls become one of the hottest new street looks. 
</P>
<P>
"The dresses have a high waist and a low neck, like the kind worn by <PERSON>Napoleon</PERSON>'s 
wife, <PERSON>Josephine</PERSON>," Sharp says. "I've always liked that silhouette. I was one of 
the first designers to do baby dolls, and now we're selling tons of them." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, since introducing baby dolls 18 months ago, Sharp says she's sold about 
30,000 of the dresses. 
</P>
<P>
"I started out selling them to high-fashion stores on Melrose Avenue, then 
<PERSON>Bullock</PERSON>'s bought them and blew them out," she says. "Now I'm selling to all of 
the major chains." 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION>, boutique owners can hardly keep baby dolls in stock. 
</P>
<P>
"All of my baby dolls are going fast," says <PERSON>Rose LeDonne</PERSON>, owner of the <PERSON>Rose 
LeDonne</PERSON> contemporary sportswear boutique in <ORGANIZATION>Dana Point</ORGANIZATION>. "My customers who are a 
little more fashion-forward really want them." 
</P>
<P>
Sharp designed her first baby doll while expecting a baby of her own. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd wear the baby doll while I was pregnant and got a lot of compliments on 
the street," she says. 
</P>
<P>
What keeps the virtually shapeless baby dolls from looking like maternity 
dresses is their sheer fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
Filmy materials such as chiffon, a popular choice among baby doll designers, 
allow slender silhouettes to show through. Anyone hoping to hide a few pounds 
beneath those yards of material will be disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"Baby dolls are very strong for the figure-conscious customer," says <PERSON>Laura 
Downing</PERSON>, owner of <LOCATION>Laura</LOCATION> -- <ORGANIZATION>The Unique Boutique</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Laguna Beach</LOCATION>, who has 
temporarily sold out of her baby dolls. 
</P>
<P>
For modesty's sake, Sharp adds a slip to wear underneath her dresses, but women 
have found other ways to wear their baby dolls without revealing too much. 
</P>
<P>
Some wear their baby dolls over "catsuits," those one-piece unitards that fit 
snugly over the body like a giant stocking. Others wear them over lace leggings 
and a bustier, biker shorts or tight denim shorts and tank tops. 
</P>
<P>
The baby doll can be interpreted in endless fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"They remind me of the <PERSON>Shirley Temple</PERSON> look," Sharp says. 
</P>
<P>
Many of her designs have "real big, fun, floppy collars," loose sleeves and 
empire waists. 
</P>
<P>
One of her baby dolls comes in sheer black georgette with red and orange 
flowers and has a wide, pointed collar with a low V-neck, an empire waist and a 
short skirt. The baby doll is available for <MONEY>$170</MONEY> at <ORGANIZATION>Bullock</ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION>South Coast 
Plaza</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Costa Mesa</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Sharp's designs look like something out of "The Great Gatsby." 
</P>
<P>
She created a sheer baby doll in solid black or white with long sleeves, a 
floppy collar, and a drop-waist skirt that falls below the knees, available for 
<MONEY>$194</MONEY> at <ORGANIZATION>Bullock's</ORGANIZATION>. The same style comes in a floral print with red, purple and 
gold flowers against an ivory background. 
</P>
<P>
Another of her old-fashioned baby dolls comes in white with bow fasteners down 
the front and a drop waist with a softly pleated long skirt, for <MONEY>$150</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
"When I style them I see them as Victorian," Sharp says. A few styles feature 
pearly buttons down the front and scoop necklines. 
</P>
<P>
Other baby dolls have a '60s look, thanks to wilder prints and those short, 
short hemlines. One short-sleeved style by <ORGANIZATION>Bon Chic Bon Genre</ORGANIZATION> is made out of a 
multicolored sheer fabric that has a tie-dyed look. The baby doll sells for <MONEY>$88</MONEY> 
at <ORGANIZATION>Bullock's</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Rose <PERSON>LeDonne</PERSON> carries a sleeveless baby doll in solid white or black rayon with 
a short, full skirt and large buttons down the front for <MONEY>$98</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Elisabetta Rogiani</PERSON>, a Los Angeles-based designer who created the tank dress, 
also has a line of fluid chiffon baby dolls. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed a softer silhouette to go over stretch lace," <PERSON>Rogiani</PERSON> says. "I wanted 
something loose but feminine." 
</P>
<P>
Rogiani has experimented liberally with the silhouette, designing baby dolls 
with uneven hemlines that are several inches shorter in front, and switching 
from bold floral prints to smaller flowers to create "a '40s antique look." 
</P>
<P>
By adding different accessories, baby dolls can go from punk to romantic. 
</P>
<P>
"You can wear them with a crocheted sweater and those funky big black shoes 
with little white socks," <PERSON>Rogiani</PERSON> says. 
</P>
<P>
"You can wear them with cowboy boots for that '70s western feeling. I've seen a 
lot of women wearing them with platform shoes and peace signs. Others wear them 
with a big cross around their necks." 
</P>
<P>
Some women wear them with a heavy pendant necklace and shoulder duster 
earrings. 
</P>
<P>
"The baby doll is so simple, it's like a canvas," <PERSON>Rogiani</PERSON> says. "You can paint 
what you want on it."

<P>
Vintage clothes are a good buy in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>, where top dealers offer a wide 
range of styles for a fraction of the cost of contemporary clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Harriet Love the most famous of the city's vintage stylists and author of 
"Guide to Vintage Chic" (<PERSON>Holt Rhinehart</PERSON>, <DATE>1982</DATE>), set the standards for 
retro-chic fashion. Her shop at 412 <PERSON>W. Broadway</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Soho</LOCATION> is the leading showcase 
for this marriage of old and new. 
</P>
<P>
"When I began in <DATE>1965</DATE>, I really focused exclusively on vintage clothing, much 
of it Victorian in look," Love said. "The '60s were the big costume era. But 
now customers have a more contemporary, practical vision and need. So I've 
become much more eclectic. This gives customers a lot of fashion options; they 
can merge the romance of the past with modern convenience." 
</P>
<P>
Love's shop is filled with merchandise that has been collected by 150 "pickers" 
-- buyers who scour the nation's yard sales, flea markets and estate closets 
for pieces that are not only of stylistic interest but in near-mint condition. 
The shop is small, and every square inch is used for display. 
</P>
<P>
Love usually shows 250 to 300 pieces of clothing bearing the labels of such 
designers as <LOCATION>Worth</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Hattie Carnegie</PERSON>, <PERSON>Schiaparelli</PERSON>. Stock changes constantly, 
but there are always '30s and '40s dresses (<MONEY>$125</MONEY> to <MONEY>$175</MONEY>) with bold print 
designs, as well as a good selection of beaded blouses (<MONEY>$145</MONEY> to <MONEY>$195</MONEY>), some 
with buttons down the back. A black cashmere <PERSON>Ballentine</PERSON> sweater with 
multicolored beading costs <MONEY>$175</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
Jackets are in rayon, gabardine and wool, and many have beading around the 
collar and cuffs. A mauve gabardine '40s jacket with a cinched waist, white 
buttons and some white beading on the collar costs <MONEY>$200</MONEY>, and is displayed with 
eggplant-colored silk pants (<MONEY>$112</MONEY>). 
</P>
<P>
The highly stylized jackets bearing the label of <PERSON>Lilli Ann</PERSON> of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> are 
priced from <MONEY>$150</MONEY>. They include gabardines with satin piping, black velvet and 
black faille combinations and a jacket of black silk patterned with a 
turquoise-and-white design and lined with red silk. 
</P>
<P>
For men, there are fabulous '40s ties priced at <MONEY>$45</MONEY> to <MONEY>$55</MONEY>, as well as terrific 
Hawaiian shirts, vintage '40s to '60s, priced at <MONEY>$125</MONEY> to <MONEY>$250</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
Love is also known for her extraordinary collection of costume and estate 
jewelry. The shop has three showcases filled with about 1,000 pieces, ranging 
from men's cufflinks for <MONEY>$35</MONEY> to a <MONEY>$600</MONEY> pair of Victorian earrings in gold , 
emerald and pearl. 
</P>
<P>
There are also accessories, including Bakelite or beaded (<MONEY>$85</MONEY> to <MONEY>$110</MONEY>) and 
alligator (<MONEY>$175</MONEY> to <MONEY>$450</MONEY>) purses. The newer clothes in the shop include <PERSON>Mary 
Jane Mariafiano</PERSON> and <PERSON>Anne Mieke</PERSON> sweaters, <ORGANIZATION>Equipment</ORGANIZATION> shirts and Zelda jackets. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria Falls (451 <PERSON>W. Broadway</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Soho</LOCATION>), the shop belonging to designer and 
stylist <PERSON>Rina Gill</PERSON>, was founded in <DATE>1976</DATE> and created a craze for Victorian 
lingerie worn as street garb. The shop still features the Victorian romantic 
look, but now augments its stock of authentic turn-of-the-century linen and 
lace petticoats (<MONEY>$75</MONEY> to <MONEY>$400</MONEY>), camisoles (<MONEY>$60</MONEY> to <MONEY>$250</MONEY>) and nighties (<MONEY>$120</MONEY> to 
<MONEY>$400</MONEY>), with <PERSON>Gill</PERSON>'s own line of Victorian-look contemporary linen camisoles 
(from <MONEY>$90</MONEY>) to be worn with silk gabardine skirts and jackets (about <MONEY>$600</MONEY> a 
suit). 
</P>
<P>
Both the originals and <PERSON>Gill</PERSON>'s adaptations are delicate and delightful, ranging 
from the rather simple country look to elegant and sophisticated designs 
covered with embroidery. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a selection of exquisite high-neck, dropped-waist, gauzy, 
hem-stitched dresses dating to the turn of the century (from about <MONEY>$450</MONEY>), to be 
worn at weddings or fancy afternoon lawn parties, as well as beaded dresses 
from the '20s (<MONEY>$250</MONEY> to <MONEY>$850</MONEY>). 
</P>
<P>
Accessories include antique hats, handbags (including a '40s alligator purse 
for <MONEY>$140</MONEY> and a <DATE>1910</DATE> lacy crocheted silk wedding bag for <MONEY>$120</MONEY>) and 
handkerchiefs, vintage '30s and priced at <MONEY>$10</MONEY> each. 
</P>
<P>
Liza's Place (132 <ORGANIZATION>Thompson St.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Soho</LOCATION>), now in its sixth year, specializes in 
vintage evening wear. This large shop shows all the fashion flair of its 
Brazilian owner. The place is painted a pleasant light lilac, and the stock -- 
about 800 pieces of clothing at any given time -- hangs on the walls or from 
the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
The clothes, in perfect condition and rather expensive, are the sort that might 
be seen in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's <ORGANIZATION>Costume Collection</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
There are '20s flappers' dresses in gold and covered with beads (about <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY>), 
and dramatic turn-of-the-century capes in red velvet with gold trim (about 
<MONEY>$1,200</MONEY>), as well as a rich selection of wedding dresses from the <DATE>1900s</DATE> through 
the <DATE>1930s</DATE>, priced from about <MONEY>$1,200</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
Liza also has fabulous hats from the '20s, '30s and <DATE>'40s</DATE> and shoes (priced at 
about <MONEY>$250</MONEY>) from the <DATE>'30s</DATE> and <DATE>'40s</DATE>, plus fine silver jewelry by <ORGANIZATION>Chanel</ORGANIZATION> and 
<PERSON>Schiaparelli</PERSON>, from about <MONEY>$200</MONEY> and up. 
</P>
<P>
Alice Underground (481 Broadway, <LOCATION>Soho</LOCATION>, and 380 <LOCATION>Columbus Ave.</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Upper West Side</ORGANIZATION>) 
has rack after rack of women's '40s print rayon dresses (from <MONEY>$40</MONEY>), '50s cotton 
dresses (from <MONEY>$12</MONEY>) and vintage prom and party dresses, including tulles, 
failles and laces (from <MONEY>$25</MONEY>). 
</P>
<P>
Men's items include brocade smoking jackets and rayon robes (from <MONEY>$20</MONEY>), plus 
ties, jeans (from <MONEY>$6</MONEY>) and baggy trousers (from <MONEY>$15</MONEY>). There are also vintage 
leather flight jackets (from <MONEY>$125</MONEY>) and a vast selection of tweed jackets and 
coats (from <MONEY>$30</MONEY>). Stock changes constantly. New stock is usually put on the 
racks on <DATE>Fridays</DATE>. The merchandise is usually in good condition, but check 
carefully for rips, missing buttons and other damage before buying. 
</P>
<P>
Reminiscence (74 <LOCATION>Fifth Ave.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Greenwich Village</LOCATION>) mixes inexpensive vintage 
clothes with its own line of moderately priced contemporary copies. The dresses 
include boldly patterned numbers with cap or no sleeves, square neck and circle 
skirt (priced from <MONEY>$12</MONEY> to <MONEY>$100</MONEY>). 
</P>
<P>
Men's baggy pants in rayon and linen cost about <MONEY>$38</MONEY> to <MONEY>$48</MONEY>. Men's '50s and '60s 
boxy tweed coats cost <MONEY>$28</MONEY> to <MONEY>$70</MONEY>, and '50s raincoats are priced from <MONEY>$18</MONEY>. When 
the shop's supply of original '40s World War II era overalls, dyed in vibrant 
colors, were sold out, Reminiscence began to manufacture copies. These sell for 
<MONEY>$18</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
Off the tourist trail but promising for dedicated shoppers, <ORGANIZATION>Domsey</ORGANIZATION>'s (431 <LOCATION>Kent 
Ave.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Williamsburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION>) is a two-square-block repository of vintage and 
remaindered clothing. The store receives hundreds of thousands of pounds of 
clothing a week from charity drives and warehouse close-outs across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Everything is dumped into bins and sold by weight (<MONEY>$2</MONEY> to <MONEY>$3</MONEY> per pound). Picking 
through the bins can be a challenge even for the most dedicated bargain hunter. 
</P>
<P>
Those with less stamina can shop in the adjacent four-floor Annex (the entrance 
is around the corner at 488 <ORGANIZATION>Whyte St.</ORGANIZATION>), where items are displayed on racks and 
have price tags (<MONEY>$2</MONEY> to <MONEY>$15</MONEY> per item). Be prepared to spend several hours 
sifting through miles of dresses, skirts, shirts, slacks, vests, suits, 
trousers and shoes that date from the '20s through the <DATE>'70s</DATE> and are not 
arranged by size. 
</P>
<P>
The search can be rewarded with superb buys, such as two-tone wing-tip men's 
shoes for <MONEY>$10</MONEY> a pair or a stunning black wool '50s cocktail dress with cut-out 
back, in perfect condition, for <MONEY>$6</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
To get to <ORGANIZATION>Domsey</ORGANIZATION>'s by subway, take the J, M or Z train to <PERSON>Marcy Avenue</PERSON>, then 
walk down Broadway toward the river until you reach Kent Avenue. Of course, 
what you save on clothes should easily cover the cost of a cab.

FT  04 JUL 92 / How to Spend It: A jewel of a name

<TEXT>
LALIQUE is one of the greatest of names in the litany of fine French
companies that cluster together near the Madeleine in the poshest part of
<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>. It was <PERSON>Rene Lalique</PERSON> who lifted the company out of the ranks of mere
producers of glass into starry status of world-famous designers of
sought-after crystal. However, <PERSON>Rene Lalique</PERSON> actually began in a smaller way
 -with jewellery.
<PERSON>Marie-Claude Lalique</PERSON>, his grand-daughter, has now gone back to where her
grandfather started and has produced a summery, colourful collection of
crystal jewellery, photographed right. The Cabochon collection comes in 14
colourways, including bracelets and ear-rings, brooches, pendants, pins, tie
clips and cufflinks. Prices range from Pounds 345 for the bracelet and
Pounds 125 for the ear-rings to Pounds 75 for the pendant. The collection is
stocked at the Lalique shop at 162 New Bond Street, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> W1Y 9PA, at
<ORGANIZATION>Selfridges of Oxford Street</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> W1, at <ORGANIZATION>Mappin &amp; Webb</ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION>Regent Street</ORGANIZATION>
and from <PERSON>Mulberry Hall</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Stonegate</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>York</LOCATION>.
Some lovely new wallpapers from <ORGANIZATION>Osborne &amp; Little</ORGANIZATION> have been brought out.
Scaglia is a striking paper rendering of Italian marbling which comes in 20
different colourways, ranging from a rich terracotta to a heavenly pale
blue, from palest apricot to a country green. Stronger and more striking
than its forerunner, <ORGANIZATION>Sienna</ORGANIZATION>, it is an easy, almost instant way of conjuring
up some of the latest paint effects.
If <PERSON>Scaglia</PERSON> is too strong for your tastes then take a look at <LOCATION>Pietra</LOCATION>, also
new to the range, which imitates very soft Italianate stone effects. There
are some 20 different colours: gentle stones, beiges, greens, blues, pinks.
Both papers come in rolls of 10 m long by 52 cm wide and both sell at Pounds
17.15 per roll (inclusive of VAT) from <ORGANIZATION>Osborne &amp; Little</ORGANIZATION>'s own shops at
304-308 King's Road, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> SW3 5UH and 39 Queen Street, <LOCATION>Edinburgh</LOCATION>, and from
good interior decorators and designers.
What does a well-dressed chap wear on his feet when he is relaxing around
the house during the <DATE>summer</DATE>? Docksiders, that's what. Once the only shoe the
yachting crowd would contemplate, it has now become the THE snob shoe for
fashionable landlubbers as well.
The pukka original version was a soft, comfortable moccasin, treated with
oil to make it waterproof and with rubber soles to keep the wearer steady on
deck. The most noticeable trademark, though, are the eyelets and lacing at
the sides. Versions abound in almost every high street shoe shop, but
anybody who is not near a good shoe shop might like to buy the Sebago
version direct by mail from <ORGANIZATION>Shipton &amp; Heneage</ORGANIZATION>, 117 <LOCATION>Queenstown Road</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Battersea</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> SW8 (tel: 071-738-8484).
Prices are Pounds 55 for the women's shoe, Pounds 60 for men. Colours are
plain tan, two-tone tan, suede, navy and white, navy and tan. And remember -
NO socks.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Fashion:The Lady loves to shock - Jane Mulvagh asks Lady
Powell about her choice of clothes and gets a surprising answer / Me and My
Wardrobe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MULVAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forget propriety. Carla, <PERSON>Lady Powell</PERSON>, was wearing skin-tight, black,
cashmere leggings and a smile as bright as a Cadillac chrome fender. As she
greets you at the door, she exudes ebullient, recession-proof chutzpah.
Married at 19, <PERSON>Lady Powell</PERSON>, the 51-year-old Italian wife of the erstwhile
diplomat and Number 10 adviser, has spent the <DATE>last 30 years</DATE> escorting her
sage plenipotentiary through the corridors of power.
Ask her about her style and she answers with winning directness. 'Oh, it's
short and tarty, like Crystal in 'Dynasty'.'
What joy she must bring to all crusty mandarins - or 'old goats' as she
affectionately calls them - for she loves to shock in Atlantic-deep
decolletes, Kilimanjaro-high minis and dresses slashed from here to
eternity. 'I love big shoulders, low necks, tight waists and high heels.'
Whether she is hosting a private dinner for visiting dignitaries or
attending a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> banquet, her dress teeters on the borders of a
diplomatic incident.
Lady <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> is a devotee of high-heeled court shoes. 'I'm tiny, a midget, so
I need heels, and then I feel, well . . .' she completes the picture with
Monroe-like gestures. Those heels are lined up like lethal weapons along 12
shelves, each bearing half a dozen pairs of 3in-high stilettoes but there
does not seem to be a single walking shoe or plimsoll among them nor even a
black, brown or navy court shoe with sensible heels.
Instead . . . puce, pea-green, lacquer-red, lambent patents, glittering
lurex and crushed velvets. And there, on the top shelf, standing alone, the
pride of her armoury, awaiting coquettish deployment, is another pair,
6in-heeled <PERSON>Vivienne Westwood</PERSON> platforms.
Some of this is a bit deceptive: <PERSON>Paul Johnson</PERSON>, the writer and her daily
walking companion, later tells me that she is a keen hill walker and rock
climber and three very professional-looking pairs of climbing boots lurk
somewhere in the house.
Lady <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> is a master of the Wildean art of how to flirt. 'I can get away
with it because of self-control,' she begins somewhat disarmingly. 'I'm very
earthy and I shock sometimes, but never too much. It's like drinking; you
have to know what you can get away with and you have to understand the
occasions when you can.'
Her style is carefully gauged to contrast her own ebullient personality with
her husband's academic and outwardly austere demeanour. She feels that 'by
marrying me he thinks it's this exotic thing that he can't control. The rest
of his life is so in control. You see he comes from a military family -
neat, tidy, organised - he even makes his own bed in the <TIME>morning</TIME>. He's
totally amused by the way I dress.'
State, and now private sector, matters prevent them from dressing for dinner
together and so Sir <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> never knows what his wife will turn up in next.
She loves to sail close to the wind, just to see her husband's face and
recalls her first invitation to a formal dinner at Number 10 Downing Street.
'<PERSON>Charles</PERSON> was really scared about that first dinner, what I'd wear. I was
advised by <PERSON>Robin Butler</PERSON> (head of the civil service) that I should dress
down. To <PERSON>Carla Powell</PERSON> that was as good as a challenge. 'I had the most
stunning dress you can imagine from <PERSON>Victor Edelstein</PERSON>. White, shoulders out
to here, very <ORGANIZATION>Dynasty</ORGANIZATION>, and totally proper in the front. I walked up to <PERSON>Mrs
Thatcher</PERSON> with <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> standing behind her, all proper.
'Then I turned and boom] It was backless down to There: I looked back over
my shoulder and, Oh] <PERSON>Charles</PERSON>'s look was too wonderful] You see, what men
don't understand is that <PERSON>Mrs Thatcher</PERSON>, being a woman, would have loved all
that]'
<PERSON>Mary Henderson</PERSON>, wife of Sir <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON>, guided the Powells through their early
years in the diplomatic service. Superficially the two women seem poles
apart; in fact they are close friends.
Lady <PERSON>Henderson</PERSON> seems to look on Lady <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> almost as a secret weapon. 'When
she was on our staff in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>,' <PERSON>Mary Henderson</PERSON> recalls, 'whenever we had a
difficult dinner we'd always ask <PERSON>Carla</PERSON>. She'd sit cross-legged at the feet
of our important guest and he'd be completely bowled over by her and
everything went well. She dresses in a very sexy way and is full of
vitality. And being in the foreign service she's had to do it all on a very
tight budget.'
Lady <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> subscribes, out of necessity, to that long British tradition,
which makes the average Italian shudder, of 'make-do and mend'. Ripping the
black <LOCATION>Chantilly</LOCATION> lace from an old ball gown, she can turn it into a mini
pencil-skirt by adding elastic to the waist and then popping it over a
shiny, tar-black, <PERSON>Norma Komali</PERSON> body.
When her husband saw it he exclaimed, 'Oh God] How could you] It's
transparent]' But now he loves it, she says.
Lady <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> heartily defends the diplomatic wives, so often ridiculed for
their dowdy, home-made dresses. 'They have to dress for all sorts of
occasions with very little money and you should hear some of the tricks we
used.'
'You know about the <ORGANIZATION>Embassy Dress</ORGANIZATION>, of course? The black one with spots on it
 -very simple.'
This grand couture evening dress from Dior was made for <ORGANIZATION>Marina Berry</ORGANIZATION> in the
<DATE>1960s</DATE>. It was passed on to her sister-in-law, <PERSON>Harriet Berry</PERSON>, and eventually
on to <LOCATION>Carla</LOCATION>. It is still in circulation. 'We all had our best times in that
dress,' Lady <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> beams, 'and whoever had it we'd all ring up and ask if
we could borrow the dress for the night.'
While working for <ORGANIZATION>Hambros</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Lady Powell</PERSON> was expected to look efficient and
business-like. But, instead of buying a navy suit at <PERSON>Jaeger</PERSON>, she stopped
over in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> and bought metres of washed silk in fuchsia, marrowfat
green and midnight blue. In <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> she bought floral-patterned cashmere,
lining it with matching silk: 'So much more glamorous than a winter coat,
don't you agree?' Three suits, three shawls, all for the price of one Armani
jacket.
Other tricks include Pounds 50 crochet dresses from Roman boutiques, old
ball dresses chopped into thigh-high minis and, her one extravagant buy, a
minuscule petrol-blue and black lace dress from a Saint Laurent sale in the
south of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
And although her financial circumstances have changed, thanks to Sir
<PERSON>Charles</PERSON>'s post at <PERSON>Jardine Matheson</PERSON>, she still prefers to shop in boutiques
and second-hand markets, although she admits to a weakness for <ORGANIZATION>Anouska
Hempel</ORGANIZATION> and Dior.
One cannot see Lady <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> submitting to middle age or sobriety no matter
what her husband's station. He may be proper in his grey flannels but she
continues to teeter alongside him cajoling, teasing and flirting in
<LOCATION>Chantilly</LOCATION> lace and impossible heels.
'We're complete opposites,' she beams. Last year the couple were announced
by a master of ceremonies at a dinner. He pronounced his name poshly, like
<PERSON>Disraeli</PERSON>'s slippery pole; she pronounced it with the wide-mouthed 'o'. The
MC pronounced both and the room roared with laughter.

<HEAD>Bootmaker Appeals to Professional Cowboys, Yuppies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By J.L. SCHMIDT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ELLSWORTH, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who spent 20 years on the rodeo
circuit now makes his living making boots and other items that fit
the special needs of professional cowboys.
   And a few yuppies who would like to look like professional
cowboys.
   <PERSON>Veldon Morgan</PERSON>, his wife and two sons, run the <ORGANIZATION>Old Spade Western
Store</ORGANIZATION> that greets visitors to this community of about two-dozen
people in the heart of the <LOCATION>Nebraska Panhandle</LOCATION>.
   Handmade Morgan boots, which line the walls of the rustic store
built in <DATE>1869</DATE>, run from <MONEY>$119</MONEY> to <MONEY>$750</MONEY>, excluding custom orders.
   The newest boot, a lace-up roper, was the brainchild of the
54-year-old <ORGANIZATION>Morgan</ORGANIZATION> and a professional rodeo friend and customer.
   ``Regular cowboy boots have a somewhat flimsy shaft,'' explained
<PERSON>Wayne Morgan</PERSON>, Veldon's son and general manager. ``Professional
ropers complain that when they step, jump or fly off a horse it's
easy to twist an ankle in conventional boots.''
   A U-shaped toe and a block heel make the new lace-up boots
working boots bound to be a hit with cowboys.
   ``The professional rodeo cowboy is a honed athlete, but they've
always had to dress like a ranch cowboy,'' the elder <PERSON>Morgan</PERSON> said
<DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   ``To send them into the rodeo arena dressed like a ranch cowboy
is like sending a boxer into the ring wearing cowboy boots,'' said
<PERSON>Morgan</PERSON>, who was on the professional rodeo circuit for 20 years.
``The guy with the boxing shoes would beat the other guy every
time.''
   The company also has found a new market: ``one we'd never expect,
among yuppies on the coasts,'' his son said.
   ``The idea of a lace-up cowboy boot must just appeal to them.''
   So, apparently, does the gear used to carry coiled ropes and
boots and saddles, he said.
   ``We've expanded the nylon luggage line into a whole area of
backpacking, horsepacking and camping equipment as well,'' <PERSON>Wayne
Morgan</PERSON> said.
   More than 40 people work in the large manufacturing plant and
warehouses attached to the store.
   The complex has been expanded twice as the business has grown,
<PERSON>Wayne Morgan</PERSON> said. Last <DATE>spring</DATE>, the company bought the <ORGANIZATION>Laramie Boot
Co.</ORGANIZATION> and some manufacturing is done in <LOCATION>El Paso</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   Handmade saddles ranging from <MONEY>$895</MONEY> to <MONEY>$2,000</MONEY> have become another
staple of the business. It takes 15 hours to assemble a plain
saddle's 25 to 30 parts, <PERSON>Wayne Morgan</PERSON> said.
   Craftsmen work at individual booths in the factory, concentrating
on one saddle at a time.
   ``We've tried to make things that are needed,'' <PERSON>Vernon Morgan</PERSON>
said. ``Somebody made lace-up boots back in the <DATE>'30s</DATE> and then quit.
We decided to pick it up again. It's a new frontier out there.''

FT  25 JUN 94 / Fashion: Why baggy shorts are down and out - John Morgan
urges Englishmen to use more imagination when packing their holiday clothes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is always easy to spot the Englishman on holiday. He is the burnt one,
whose clothes - an untantalising mixture of sagging swimwear and ill-chosen
separates - set him apart so dismally from most other nationalities.
Many men who dress appropriately for the office and attractively at
weekends, often abandon any vestige of sartorial savoir faire at passport
control. This is an unnecessary shame: a holiday wardrobe, like any other,
requires only a little imaginative application and a modicum of
self-knowledge.
The first rule of holiday dressing (assuming a reasonably sophisticated
destination that offers the usual mix of beach life, sight-seeing and night
life) is to remember that the same body you live with throughout the year
comes on holiday too and, thus, clothes that do not suit your shape at home
will look even worse abroad.
This may seem obvious, but I am constantly amazed by how many Englishmen
dress like clowns when on holiday. The right clothes make economic as well
as practical sense, as they will integrate happily into your general <DATE>summer</DATE>
wardrobe when you return home.
The second principle is to go easy on colour. The English complexion may
look peerless when celebrated by <PERSON>Lely</PERSON> or <PERSON>Gainsborough</PERSON>, but does not stand up
well to the harsh glare of the southern sun.
Unclothed, I, like many of my compatriots, bear a striking, and seriously
unappetising, resemblance to saumon en croute before it goes in the oven.
Leave bright colours to others and, instead, look at soft cream, stone, ecru
and white, with a few earth tones - such as terracotta and indigo for the
more adventurous.
A restricted colour palette will also help with the third prerequisite of
the holiday wardrobe - interchangeability. So will sticking to clothes in
plain rather than patterned fabrics. No one wants to travel with masses of
luggage, yet most people pack far more than they need. Everything described
here is designed to work together in different combinations, depending on
weather conditions and dress codes.
So we come to the components. The first necessity is a good lightweight
jacket. It is both practical and versatile and its pockets mean you need not
wear a money belt which, although undeniably useful, is grisly to look at.
The jacket should be made of linen, which is the coolest and most breathable
of cloths. Man-made fibres, no matter how advanced, should be left at home.
Some of the nicest jackets comes from <LOCATION>Dries</LOCATION> van Noten at <LOCATION>Joseph</LOCATION>. Made from
white linen, they are unstructured and cut fashionably long.
Alternatively, plump for a more robust white cotton drill blazer bristling
with antique brass buttons from Voyage, an excellent shop in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s Fulham
Road selling clothes ideal for travelling.
You also need to pack a couple of pairs of trousers. These could be the
lightweight linens, matching the Dries van Noten jacket, a pair of more
substantial cotton chinos from The Gap, in khaki, stone and salt, or, more
fashionably, a pair of draw string, pyjama-style pants from Voyage. These
would look much more up-to-the-minute than jeans and are also more
comfortable in hot climates.
When it comes to the vexed question of shorts, length is crucial. Too long
and you will look like a superannuated boy scout; too short and you appear
undressed. Opt for a beautifully-cut, mid-length pair in stone-coloured
linen by <PERSON>Margaret Howell</PERSON>. They are flattering and versatile. Passable
cheaper versions can be found at <PERSON>Thomas Burberry</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Marks</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Spencer</PERSON> and The
Gap.
<PERSON>Margaret Howell</PERSON> also scores well with her understated, relaxed shirts in
cotton or linen. These are cut generously, are cool to wear and can be
teamed with trousers, shorts and worn as a cover-up on the beach. Also
include a selection of classic polo shirts in <LOCATION>Sea Island</LOCATION> cotton from <PERSON>John
Smedley</PERSON> and plenty of white cotton T-shirts by the American manufacturer,
Hanes. Should you need clothing for a black tie occasion, an
exquisitely-made, knife-pleated evening shirt from <PERSON>Budd</PERSON>, in the coolest
cotton voile, is the most elegant thing you can wear.
A <DATE>summer</DATE> suit is also recommended. Ivory linen is always the most glamorous
choice. It can be worn on any occasion when you have to dress up a little
and its components can be worn separately with other items in your holiday
wardrobe. Also, with the addition of the <PERSON>Budd</PERSON> evening shirt, a corded silk
black bow tie and a pair of patent pumps, it will convert into an acceptable
tropical dinner jacket.
Designer <PERSON>Paul Smith</PERSON> has a three-button, single-breasted version that
manages, in true <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> fashion, to look both classic and contemporary. More
conventional tastes could invest in his khaki cotton version or an even more
traditional model in olive, buff or navy from <PERSON>Hackett</PERSON>, although neither of
these could be transformed into black tie.
When it comes to beachwear, I am rather tired of seeing Englishmen lolloping
about in baggy shorts. I feel that surfing jams look best on those for whom
they were originally intended. Opt instead for a pair of well-designed
classic swimming trunks.
Speedo have good styles including a model made in a special sleek
lightweight fabric developed for professional swimmers. Look out, too, for
designs by the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Sporting Club</ORGANIZATION> at branches of Sports Locker. Black
or darkest navy blue, remain the smartest colour choice. Remember, white is
for exhibitionists only as it becomes transparent when wet.
The beach look is completed with a cotton singlet available in a selection
of muted hues from Voyage. This year's most trendy holiday garment is a
Kikoi from <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>, which works as a wrap, towel, mat and, for some men,
tropical night wear.
When choosing footwear, espadrilles are de rigueur. Both <PERSON>Ralph Lauren</PERSON> and
Dries van Noten have attractive designer versions, but you are probably best
buying them on location.
You should also include a couple of pairs of Superga Originali plimsolls, in
navy, white or ecru, a washable deck shoe by <PERSON>Dexter</PERSON>, a pair of the lightest
canvas desert boots from <PERSON>Fratelli Rossetti</PERSON> and a pair of formal light-brown
lace-up shoes. I am particularly impressed with <PERSON>John Lobb Oxfords</PERSON> at <PERSON>Kurt
Geiger</PERSON>, which are elegant and light. If you want to wear sandals, <PERSON>Paul Smith</PERSON>
has a handsome classic design in brown or black leather.
A cotton sweater is a must for cool evenings - and there is little to beat
<PERSON>Marion Foale</PERSON>'s classic, understated and beautifully-made knitwear. The look
would be completed by a fold-up, wide-brimmed, panama from <PERSON>Herbert Johnson</PERSON>,
a couple of silk ties from <ORGANIZATION>Turnbull &amp; Asser</ORGANIZATION> and sunglasses from the <PERSON>Paul
Smith</PERSON> range. With these purchases you will have a holiday wardrobe that,
although classic in inspiration, will be modern, practical and stylish. Bon
voyage.

   As the saying goes, you never get a second chance to make a
first impression. So making a good one can be a vital key in your
quest for corporate success. How you look and how you communicate
during an interview can affect its outcome.
   Among contenders with equal qualifications, the candidate who
with the best communications skills is the one most likely to get
the job offer, says <PERSON>Barbara McEntee</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> communications
consultant whose clients include some of the country's top
companies. ``In fact, the ability to communicate well is ranked as
the number one key to success by leaders in business, politics and
the professions,'' she says.
   Job-seekers can say a great deal about themselves without
uttering a word, says <PERSON>Richard Press</PERSON>, grandson of the founder of <ORGANIZATION>J.
Press Clothiers</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Without words, a properly-dressed applicant lets the
interviewer know he will fit into the `corporate culture' of a
company,'' says Press, whose male customers include leaders of
business and industry.
   How should a man dress for an interview?
   ``Conservatively,'' says Press, in a word. ``Most corporations
value a traditional approach to work and apparel.''
   Some of his recommendations for the job applicant:
   _ Suit: <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> blue or dark gray pinstripes, single breasted.
   _ Shirt: White, with spread or button-down collar (some
companies have a white-shirt-only policy).
   _ Tie: Ancient madder foulard or patterned silk (never wear a
striped tie with a pinstripe suit).
   _ Handkerchief for breast pocket: Optional (it should complement
but not match the tie).
   Socks: <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> blue or black over-the-calf.
   Shoes: Calfskin lace-ups, well polished.
   Press says clothes should be thought of as a career investment.
``If a suit is selected with care,'' he notes, ``it will last five
or more years without going out of style.''
   Both men and women should strive for the neat, tailored look, he
adds.
   Posture also is important in the job interview, according to
<PERSON>Linda Fields</PERSON>, an expert on body language and public speaking.
   ``Slouching sends a message you're insecure and nervous and
perhaps not capable of handling the job,'' says <PERSON>Ms. Fields</PERSON>, a
principal of <ORGANIZATION>New York-based Fields &amp; McKamy International Speaker
Services</ORGANIZATION>. Sitting on the edge of the chair will help you avoid the
slouch, she says.
   Both <PERSON>Ms. Fields</PERSON> and <PERSON>McEntee</PERSON> say the candidate should maintain
eye contact and appear confident.

VANS UNMATCHED IN QUICKLY FILLING ORDERS FOR CUSTOM SHOES

When it comes to colors, few shoemakers can rival Vans. The company's canvas 
sneakers are sold in more than 30 different shades and prints, from red 
checkerboard to little green fish swimming through a sea of black-and-white 
swirls. 
</P>
<P>
But when a retailer recently placed a large order for sneakers in bright 
purple, green and orange, Vans didn't have them. But the shoe manufacturer 
promised that it could make them -- fast. 
</P>
<P>
And therein lies the Vans secret. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no shoe company that can respond as quickly," boasted company 
President <PERSON>Richard Leeuwenburg</PERSON>, sinking back onto a couch while pointing the 
waffle soles of his light-colored Vans sneakers at a visitor. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the retailer had uncovered a fashion trend that had eluded 
the rest of the shoe industry. The purple, green and orange shoes are expected 
to be so popular with the back-to-school crowd that Vans is featuring them in 
its billboard ads. 
</P>
<P>
Vans, founded in <DATE>1966</DATE> as the <ORGANIZATION>Van Doren Rubber Co.</ORGANIZATION>, rose to dizzying success in 
the wake of the <DATE>1982</DATE> movie "Fast Times at Ridgemont High." Actor <PERSON>Sean Penn</PERSON> wore 
a pair of checkerboard Vans in the film, sparking a wave of teen-age copycats 
who snatched up every pair they could find. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to cash in on its hit product, Van Doren Rubber expanded quickly by 
building new stores -- too quickly, as it turned out. When the fad died out, 
sales plummeted and the company suddenly was stuck with the big debt incurred 
during its expansion. By <DATE>1984</DATE>, the company had filed for protection from 
creditors in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. But it didn't stay there 
long. 
</P>
<P>
The company emerged a year later and was sold to a Menlo Park venture capital 
firm, <ORGANIZATION>McCown De Leeuw &amp; Co</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Leeuwenburg</PERSON> (the similarity between his name 
and the venture capital firm's is only coincidental) took over the company and 
has embarked on a strategy of expansion beyond <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>. The 
48-year-old executive said the <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION> and foreign markets are ripe for 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
He said the shoes are especially popular in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. Sales in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> 
would have been even better, <PERSON>Leeuwenburg</PERSON> said, except for a counterfeit ring 
that flooded the Mexican market with cheaply made knockoffs of Vans shoes. The 
counterfeit ring was broken up by Mexican authorities, but not before the 
company lost an estimated <MONEY>$4 million</MONEY> in profits in <DATE>1989</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping that the counterfeiting problem is behind it, <PERSON>Leeuwenburg</PERSON> predicts a 
strong year for the shoemaker. At least one industry observer agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"That whole fashion-active look . . . is one of the biggest-growing 
categories," said <PERSON>Dick Silverman</PERSON>, editor of the 30,000-circulation Footwear 
News, a New York-based trade publication. "That market overall is in good 
shape." 
</P>
<P>
The key to the company's success, <PERSON>Leeuwenburg</PERSON> said, is the ability of the 
1,500-employee manufacturing plant to handle special orders as well as the 
company's stock. The flexibility also allows the company to quickly adopt new 
fabrics or colors into its lines so that it can stay on the cutting edge of 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
A quarter of the 75,000 pairs of shoes that the company manufactures this year 
will be custom-ordered. Customers can select shoes in different colors and 
shades from the company's catalogue, and retailers can place special orders for 
large volumes. Custom shoes cost <MONEY>$2</MONEY> to <MONEY>$5</MONEY> more than the usual <MONEY>$30</MONEY> price tag. 
</P>
<P>
The company's most popular model, a lace-up sneaker, has not changed in design 
since its introduction in <DATE>1966</DATE>. But by constantly adding new colors of canvas 
or stripes, the look can be simply updated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Leeuwenburg</PERSON> acknowledges that Vans is a bit player in an industry dominated by 
the likes of <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION>. The company holds less than <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> of the sport shoe 
market and has its highest profile in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>, where it has 59 
company-owned retail stores. Its shoes are also sold by some large retail 
chains such as the Foot Locker. 
</P>
<P>
Vans had sales of about <MONEY>$70 million</MONEY> for its fiscal year ended in <DATE>May</DATE>. The 
privately held company does not disclose its profits. 
</P>
<P>
The company focuses its marketing efforts on its core customer group: males 
ages 9 to 19. It markets its shoes as a unique alternative to regular sport 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"The product itself is fun," he said.

<LEADPARA>  IT'S THOSE three seconds that give you pause. You've leaped face-first from
the crane platform, the elastic cords strapped to your ankles undulating
limply a few feet away as you drop. It's supposed to be about three seconds
before the cords start to stretch and slow your fall.;    Long enough for a
moment of reflection. As you drop, rock-like, at a speed now approaching 55
mph, you wonder vacantly, "What the hell am I doing, and why?"  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     What you are doing is startlingly obvious -- you are hurtling headlong
toward a patch of rocks about 200 feet below. Why you are doing it is, of
course, another matter entirely.; (hbox);    This is bungee jumping. Some call
it a sport. Some just call it crazy. Since it's commercial start in <DATE>1988</DATE>, it's
caught on quickly with the thrill-junkie crowd. There are small firms all over
the country now offering jumps, including several in the <LOCATION>Bay Area.</LOCATION>;    The
oldest and biggest, Bungee Adventures of Mountain View, started modestly in
<DATE>May of 1988</DATE>, with its founders hooking their customers into the cords (used by
the military in dropping equipment from planes) and having them jump off
bridges.;    Now <PERSON>John</PERSON> and <PERSON>Peter Kockelman</PERSON>, the founders, own a 250-foot,
100,000 pound tower crane, which they have set up on private land near <LOCATION>Tracy</LOCATION>,
about a 1 1/2-hour drive from the <LOCATION>South Bay</LOCATION>. Every weekend dozens of people
gather there, paying <MONEY>$99</MONEY> each to scare themselves.;    You may remember the
Kockelmans. They were the ones who jumped off the bridge in the television
commercial for <ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION> sneakers. It aired only a few times before it was pulled
because it was . . . well, too crazy. Since then they've set a world bungee
record with a jump of 1,000 feet out of a hot air balloon, and plan a
2,000-foot jump from a balloon in <DATE>August</DATE>. They do exhibitions -- including one
at an <ORGANIZATION>Oakland Coliseum Grateful Dead</ORGANIZATION> show and a recent jump at a monster truck
show in SJS' Spartan Stadium -- and are developing a couple stunts for a Fox
network television show scheduled to air in the fall.;    Mostly, though, they
bring religion to folks on a hot and barren parcel of land in the <LOCATION>Central
Valley.</LOCATION>;    On a recent <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, there were about 40 people signed up
to jump. A group of 21 had made the trip over from <LOCATION>Moffett Field</LOCATION> -- <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>
fliers presumably bored with maneuvering several tons of high-tolerance
machinery through the air at excessive speeds. <PERSON>Larry Smith</PERSON>, the organizer of
the jet-jockey group, had jumped a few weeks earlier and wanted to let his
buddies -- and his girlfriend -- in on the thrill.;    Like everyone else
questioned, they had no idea exactly why they were doing this. "Sounds like
fun" was as deep as it got.;    Fun, indeed. Ask <PERSON>Smith</PERSON>'s girlfriend, <PERSON>Kim
Harris</PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION>. Before she went up in the crane platform, as she stood
below watching the first few jumpers step into the void, her face was an
immutable, twisted grimace. It was white-knuckled fear, and she admitted it.; 
  "Very nervous," she said.;    A few minutes later, she was pushing herself
backward off the platform for her 100-foot jump. Her eyes were shut tight and
she yelled not "Geronimo!" but "AAAYYYYYY!";    Back on the ground the grimace
was still there, but softened by relief.;    So was it scary?;    "Not so much
scary as awesome," she said, still out of breath.;    You going to do it
again?;    "No," she said quickly. "That's enough for me.";    Despite the
safety redundancies in the equipment and the knowledge that Bungee Adventures
have had no serious injuries in more than 15,000 jumps, jumping from a crane
100 or 200 feet in the air is pretty much as scary as it sounds.;    After a
short presentation on the procedures, the equipment and safety ("Keep your
arms and legs spread at all times"), they start taking people up one at a time
in the crane platform, which is attached to a steel cable hung from the very
top of the crane boom. The railed platform can be lowered or raised in a
matter of minutes using hydraulic controls on the ground.;    One end of the
bungee cord is hooked to the bottom of the platform; the other end is hooked
to the jumper's shoulder harness and rock-climber's seat harness. (For the
jumps from 200 feet, you can wear a customized ankle harness, so at the end of
the jump you're dangle upside-down.);    The trip to the 100-foot level is
quick. There's not much time to have second thoughts or take in the scenery.
In fact, it's a good idea not to dwell too much on the scenery from this
height -- it's like looking down from the top of a 10-story building, only the
building is suspended in mid-air, and is swaying gently in the breeze.;    The
efficiency of the operation is helped by The Countdown -- a transparent
euphemism for peer pressure. Once you're up there, hooked into the cords and
on the outside of the railing, screwing up the courage to push off, the
attendant in the platform requests the countdown via walkie-talkie.;    The
order is relayed to the group below, which yells in unison "Five, four, three,
two, one." At "one" you go. Needless to say, you lose face if you need more
than one countdown to launch. On this <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, everyone jumped at "one.";   
The trip down, those few seconds when you seem disconnected from the earth, is
like flying. It almost doesn't seem like you're plummeting like a stone. And
the cord's absorbing of your falling weight heightens the floating sensation.
There is no jerk at the end of the rope (except the jumper, of course). The
cord stretches to twice its original length, then flings you back up about <PERCENT>75
percent</PERCENT> of the distance you fell. You get about five successively smaller
bounces until you're dangling at the end of the rope and the crane operator
lowers you to the ground.;    The ankle jump from 200 feet is hairier. This
time you're supposed to approximate a swan dive from a platform that at that
height feels like it's the size of a doormat. You faintly hear the countdown
reach "one" and leap, trying to hold a modicum of form as you fall.;    The
thing about the higher jump is that its longer fall gives you just enough time
-- three seconds or so -- to think about it. Perhaps flash back to the <ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION>
ad, where the guy with the inferior shoes bought the farm, off camera at
least, leaving his empty shoes stuck in the ankle harness.;    The fall gives
you just enough time to think about that scene, and to reflect on your shoes,
and how tight you tied the laces.  </TEXT>

   LOS ANGELES -- Nike Inc. filed suit against L.A. Gear
Inc., alleging that L.A. Gear's new "Catapult" athletic shoes
infringe on patents that Nike holds.
   According to the two-count complaint filed in federal
court here, the technology that gives Catapult its bouncy
sole "embodies the invention" in the "spring moderator"
system that Nike developed. Nike hasn't used the spring
moderator in its shoes, depending instead on its "Air"
technology. "We consider the spring moderator a second horse
in our barn," said an attorney at Nike, Beaverton, Ore.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION> also claims in its suit that <LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION> Gear's Catapult
infringes <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION>'s patent on a so-called "variable lacing"
system. The suit seeks an end to the alleged infringements
and unspecified damages.
   A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>L.A. Gear</ORGANIZATION> said officials of the <LOCATION>Los
Angeles</LOCATION> company hadn't seen the complaint and therefore
couldn't comment.
   This isn't the first time that <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION> has sued <LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION> Gear
over a similarity in sneakers. Last year, <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION> alleged that
<LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION> Gear's MVP-1 too closely mimicked <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION>'s Air <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON>
basketball shoe, thereby misappropriating <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION>'s intellectual
property. The suit was settled out of court.

<P>
Don we now our gay apparel: our socks that light up like Christmas trees, our 
musical neckties that play "Jingle Bells," our boxer shorts festooned with 
reindeer. 
</P>
<P>
This season everybody's getting decked out for the holidays. Young or old, male 
or female, people are dressing from head to toe in Yuletide attire. 
</P>
<P>
Even stuffy executives have succumbed to the holiday spirit. The Tie Rack in 
<ORGANIZATION>MainPlace</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION>, had one customer swear off musical ties after his started 
playing Christmas carols during an annual meeting with 800 other executives. 
</P>
<P>
"He was sitting in the front row and he couldn't get the thing to shut off," 
says <PERSON>Ziva Adams</PERSON>, manager of the Tie Rack. "They tried dunking the tie in a 
glass of water but that only made it play louder." 
</P>
<P>
With each passing <DATE>Christmas</DATE>, the amount of seasonal garb has grown. 
</P>
<P>
At <ORGANIZATION>Nordstrom</ORGANIZATION>, men can choose from braces adorned with angels and Christmas 
trees, ties with Victorian scenes of old <ORGANIZATION>St. Nick</ORGANIZATION>, and socks with skiing Santas 
and reindeer. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these novelties do not come cheap -- the suspenders cost <MONEY>$110</MONEY> and the 
hand-sewn silk ties about <MONEY>$35</MONEY>. Yet shoppers merrily snap them up. 
</P>
<P>
"They're fun and they can be worn year after year," says <PERSON>Lenora Giovino</PERSON>, 
wardrobe consultant for <ORGANIZATION>Nordstrom</ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION>MainPlace</ORGANIZATION>. "Men are just going crazy over 
this stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Some bosses wear festive garments to show their employees they're more like 
<LOCATION>Santa Claus</LOCATION> than <LOCATION>Scrooge</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
One <ORGANIZATION>Nordstrom</ORGANIZATION> customer, a company vice president, showed up at his office 
wearing red corduroy pants covered with green Christmas trees, a shirt with 
bright candy cane stripes, suspenders and <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION> socks. 
</P>
<P>
"He blew his staff away," <PERSON>Giovino</PERSON> says. "He's a very strait-laced guy." 
</P>
<P>
Giovino's husband has worn his holiday suspenders to two Christmas galas this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been the hit of the party," she says.

Dressing up like elves is a way for people to spread holiday cheer. Yet behind 
the frivolity lies a serious desire on the part of many to find relief from a 
world they might find hard or threatening, <PERSON>Giovino</PERSON> says. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't threatening," she says. "The world is such a hard place. This 
cheers people up." 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Nordstrom</ORGANIZATION> also has battery-operated socks and mittens with light bulbs that 
actually work and colorful hand-knit sweaters for women trimmed with Christmas 
trees, snowmen, reindeer, bows and wreaths. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be fun to wear to a party," says <ORGANIZATION>Beth Southern of Villa Park</ORGANIZATION>, a 
young woman admiring one of the holiday cardigans. "It's different from your 
ordinary red sweater or green turtleneck. And it's always in style." 
</P>
<P>
Technology has added to the variety of novelty merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
The Sock Market in <ORGANIZATION>MainPlace</ORGANIZATION> has an array of socks adorned with wreaths, Santas 
and candy canes that light up and play Christmas carols, thanks to tiny 
batteries and microchips. 
</P>
<P>
Computer-generated patterns allow sock and sweater manufacturers to weave 
intricate holiday designs into their garments. Oshkosh has tiny stockings for 
infants and children decorated with detailed pictures of trains, toy soldiers 
and Christmas mice for <MONEY>$4.75</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
"Today it's all done on computer, whereas years ago they used to have to do it 
by hand," says <PERSON>Connie Gualiano</PERSON>, manager of The Sock Market. Where handmade 
socks would cost about <MONEY>$35</MONEY>, machine-made ones sell for about <MONEY>$3</MONEY> to <MONEY>$15</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to colorful graphics, socks are no longer utilitarian but a key fashion 
accessory. 
</P>
<P>
"Customers constantly call us before the holidays to see if we have our 
Christmas hosiery in," <PERSON>Gualiano</PERSON> says. 
</P>
<P>
Men who never strayed from black, brown or navy socks will now sport red and 
green stockings with bells and lights. 
</P>
<P>
For conservative <PERSON>Kris Kringles</PERSON> there are more restrained holiday styles, such 
as black socks with just a sprig of holly along the sides or gray socks with a 
single black-and-white-striped Christmas ornament. 
</P>
<P>
Men and women are buying boxer shorts adorned with Christmas mice, polar bears 
and hippo Santas for <MONEY>$12.99</MONEY> at the <ORGANIZATION>Tie Rack</ORGANIZATION>. Young women wear them on the 
outside, while <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> has sold them to businessmen to wear underneath their 
suits. 
</P>
<P>
The Tie Rack also stocks tuneful ties that play "Jingle Bells" and sell for 
<MONEY>$15.99</MONEY>. This season's most popular style shows <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION> lounging in a hammock 
under a palm tree. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an excuse to be silly," <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> says. 
</P>
<P>
Kiosks stationed throughout <LOCATION>Fashion Island</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Newport Beach</LOCATION> stock unusual 
seasonal merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
For baby, there are rompers, tennis shoes, sweat shirts and hair bows 
hand-painted with Christmas themes. 
</P>
<P>
Jamaica Me Crazy carries rubber bolos featuring Christmas cacti and Santas, 
with coordinating earrings and bracelets. 
</P>
<P>
The Sporting Life, a women's boutique in <LOCATION>Fashion Island</LOCATION>, has earrings strewn 
with miniature Christmas lights, necklaces strung with jingle bells and red 
chili peppers, red and green metallic shoelaces and Christmas sweaters with 
snowmen, trees or sequined ornaments. 
</P>
<P>
"We do really well with our novelty. People want to wear something frivolous," 
says <PERSON>Linda Recko</PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION>Sporting Life</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"People's happiest memories are of the holidays. They're trying to recapture 
those simpler, childish times."

ITALIA EXPRESS (<ORGANIZATION>FT</ORGANIZATION>, <DATE>January 14</DATE>)
A vessel was sunk outside <LOCATION>Piraeus</LOCATION> harbour and the underwriters alleged that
there had been a plot to blow up the ship. They wished to prove the original
conspiracy by means of surreptitious tapes of conversations of those
involved, including the divers allegedly responsible. At first instance, it
was held that the tapes were not admissible in evidence under the Civil
Evidence Act <DATE>1968</DATE>. Allowing the appeal against that decision in part, the
Court of Appeal stated that insofar as the tapes related to evidence of
facts stated by one of the alleged conspirators, <ORGANIZATION>GDV</ORGANIZATION>, who knew that the
conversations were being taped and who supplied the tapes, <ORGANIZATION>GDV</ORGANIZATION> was quite
deliberately making simultaneous statements both orally and in a document.
Subject to production and proof of the tapes or authenticated copies, the
statements of the other interlocutors would not be evidence of facts stated
but, in so far as they proved the context in which <ORGANIZATION>GDV</ORGANIZATION>'s statements were
made, would be evidence of that context.
<ORGANIZATION>DEUTSCHE BANK AG</ORGANIZATION> v IBRAHIM AND OTHERS (FT, <DATE>January 15</DATE>)
The bank claimed in an action in <DATE>December 1991</DATE> for a declaration that it had
valid equitable mortgages of two leases owned by the daughters of the
defendant as security for their father's overdraft. The claim was refused on
the ground that section 4 of the Statute of Frauds was not satisfied in that
there was no memorandum in writing by the daughters to support the loan.
Allowing an application to recall that judgment to hear further argument, <PERSON>Mr
David Neuberger</PERSON> QC stated that the bank had sent draft memoranda to the
daughters for signature. However, that was insufficient to satisfy section
4. The court had found that the memoranda were received by the daughters,
but were never acknowledged by them, nor executed by them in any way. It
would be quite wrong to infer approval on the daughters' part, whether of
the memoranda generally or of inclusion of their names. Moreover, the bank
could not bring the facts into the class of cases where section 4 could be
said to have been used as 'an engine of fraud'. The daughters' counterclaim
for the delivery of the title deeds for want of consideration succeeded.
IN RE <LOCATION>LONDON</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>UNITED INVESTMENTS PLC</ORGANIZATION> (FT, <DATE>January 17</DATE>)
In <DATE>October/November 1990</DATE>, the secretary of state, in exercise of his powers
under section 432(2) of the Companies Act <DATE>1985</DATE>, appointed inspectors to
investigate the affairs of a company, <ORGANIZATION>LUI</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr Wilson</PERSON> was a director of <ORGANIZATION>LUI</ORGANIZATION>
but had refused to answer the inspectors' questions, invoking the common law
privilege against self-incrimination. Moreover, he contended that it was
improper for the secretary of state to appoint inspectors to investigate
matters which were the subject of allegations of fraud because it was more
appropriate that suspected crimes should be investigated by the <ORGANIZATION>Serious
Fraud Office</ORGANIZATION> or the police. Dismissing an appeal against a first instance
decision that the refusal to answer was unjustified, the <ORGANIZATION>Court of Appeal</ORGANIZATION>
stated that under the provisions of the <DATE>1985</DATE> Act, as amended by the
Companies Act <DATE>1989</DATE>, (i) inspectors would in very many cases have been
appointed where the circumstances suggested fraud; (ii) persons questioned
were bound to answer their questions; and (iii) the inspectors' report might
lead the secretary of state to petition for winding-up or to proceed in the
company's name in the public interest.
ROYAL BANK OF <LOCATION>SCOTLAND</LOCATION> v CASSA DI RISPARMIO DELLE PROVINCIE LOMBARD AND
OTHERS (FT, <DATE>January 21</DATE>)
The Royal Bank of <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION> claimed reimbursement on a letter of credit as
confirming bank, subject to the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary
Credits <DATE>1983</DATE> Revision, where reimbursement was to take place in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
However, when the bill was still current, the issuing Italian banks had
received information to the effect that the documents might be false because
the underlying transaction was said to be fraudulent. Service of proceedings
on the issuing banks was set aside at first instance on the ground that the
English court had no jurisdiction to hear the claims under the Civil
Jurisdiction and Judgments Act <DATE>1982</DATE>, article 5 of which stated that, with
regard to contracting states, a person may be sued 'in the court of the
place of performance of the obligation in question'. Dismissing the <ORGANIZATION>Royal
Bank of Scotland</ORGANIZATION>'s appeal, the <ORGANIZATION>Court of Appeal</ORGANIZATION> stated that the 'obligation
in question' for the purposes of article 5 was the obligation to effect
reimbursement, and that was an obligation which was due for performance
outside the jurisdiction of the English court.
RE SHOE LACE LTD (FT, <DATE>January 22</DATE>)
An application was made by the liquidator of <ORGANIZATION>Shoe Lace Ltd</ORGANIZATION> for return of
company funds paid to another company, <ORGANIZATION>Sharp Investments Ltd</ORGANIZATION>, which held 80
per cent of <ORGANIZATION>Shoe Lace</ORGANIZATION>'s issued share capital. Section 245 of the Insolvency
Act <DATE>1986</DATE> provided that a floating charge created within two years before the
onset of insolvency in favour of a person connected with the company was
invalid, except to the extent of consideration paid for creation of the
charge 'at the same time as, or after, the creation of the charge'. The
floating charge was created within two months before the onset of insolvency
in the instant case where Sharp controlled Shoe Lace and so was a 'connected
person' within the section. No businessman, having knowledge of the kind of
time limits imposed by the Insolvency and Companies Acts and using ordinary
language, <PERSON>Mr Justice Hoffmann</PERSON> stated in granting the application, would say
that the payments had been made at the same time as execution of the
debenture in the present case.
<ORGANIZATION>MARC RICH &amp; CO AG</ORGANIZATION> v SOCIETA ITALIANA IMPIANTI (FT, <DATE>January 24</DATE>)
In a dispute over the sale of a cargo of oil by the defendant to the
plaintiff, the contract having been negotiated in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, the plaintiff
sought leave to appoint an arbitrator in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. The defendant issued
proceedings in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> where it was held that there was no arbitration
agreement. Article 1(4) of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Convention
<DATE>1968</DATE> provided that the Convention did not apply to arbitration and the <ORGANIZATION>Court
of Appeal</ORGANIZATION>, on the plaintiff's appeal against a dismissal of its application
to restrain the defendant from pursuing the action in <LOCATION>Genoa</LOCATION>, referred to the
<ORGANIZATION>European Court</ORGANIZATION> questions on whether the exception under article 1(4)
extended to litigation as to the initial existence of an arbitration
agreement. The <ORGANIZATION>ECJ</ORGANIZATION> held that the exclusion did extend to litigation, which
was pending before a national court and which concerned the appointment of
an arbitrator, even if existence of an arbitration was a preliminary issue
in that litigation. In light of that answer, the Court of Appeal stated, the
plaintiff's appeal against a setting aside of leave to serve on the
defendants outside the jurisdiction would be dismissed.
CHANNEL <ORGANIZATION>TUNNEL GROUP LTD &amp; ANOTHER v BALFOUR BEATTY CONSTRUCTION LTD</ORGANIZATION> &amp;
OTHERS (FT, <DATE>January 29</DATE>)
The defendant contractors (TML) appealed against a decision in an action in
which <ORGANIZATION>Eurotunnel</ORGANIZATION> had issued a writ against <ORGANIZATION>TML</ORGANIZATION>, claiming an injunction
restraining it from suspending work. No order was made on an undertaking
that <ORGANIZATION>TML</ORGANIZATION> would not suspend work except on 14 days' notice. The judge also
dismissed an application by <ORGANIZATION>TML</ORGANIZATION> that the action be stayed in favour of
arbitration. Clause 67 of the contract provided that any dispute should
first be referred to a panel of independent experts and that 'the seat of
such arbitration shall be <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>'. Allowing <ORGANIZATION>TML</ORGANIZATION>'s appeal, the <ORGANIZATION>Court of
Appeal</ORGANIZATION> stated that some of the parties were not English but French, and they
had all agreed to arbitrate in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>. The court was therefore not
concerned with a domestic arbitration agreement (see section 1(4)
Arbitration Act <DATE>1975</DATE>). Whether or not there was jurisdiction, an interim
injunction should not be granted when the parties had agreed to arbitration
in a place outside <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and there was an arbitrable dispute between them.

<HEAD>Big Moment For Lacroix in Ready-to-Wear Openings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christian Lacroix scored a solid success in his
first ready-to-wear show <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, keeping hemlines short and
flirty.
   His show capped the first day of a big week for buyers and press
who come to view what <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> has to say about next winter's clothes.
The consensus is that many influential designers plan to keep their
skirts short. Others will set hemlines zooming down.
   <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> wonder-boy <PERSON>Lacroix</PERSON> was most successful in his daytime
clothes. His late-day dresses were inspired by Moroccan folklore
and the dance hall, a departure from the ``Arlesienne'' look of
previous collections.
   He had hinted he would show very simple clothes, but couldn't
resist some occasional fantasy, and his offerings were anything but
dull.
   The show started with a bang: hot-colored coats in all shapes
from swirly trapeze to fitted, often with big fichu collars. The
little suits in houndstooth checks or plaids with fitted jackets or
tiny boleros were geared more to daily life then some of the
costumey lines in his couture collections.
   Simplicity, however, took away none of the pizazz of these
outfits, which are priced ultra-moderately compared to his ``luxe''
or couture lines. Made for him by Genny of <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, the ready-to-wear
ensembles are expected to sell for about <MONEY>$420</MONEY> to <MONEY>$1,060</MONEY>.
   Top sellers in this collection may be the fabulous silk jacquard
full-skirted coat-dresses in coral, yellow and blue.
   Lacroix was ebullient, with a fun-and-games approach in hats
such as an animal-spotted stovepipe or tipped pyramids, to go with
little satin beribboned ballerina shoes.
   He went in for some of his favorite full taffeta babydoll
dresses with bows or pyramid shapes. His fluid black jersey
waistless or fitted dresses with asymmetrical hemlines, topped by
dresses with big white organza collars might appeal as well _ to
those with conservative tastes.
   The fancier numbers included some ribbed sweaters with
embroidered net tops over flying bright skirts. There were merry
widow dresses too, complete with music-hall tights that had lace
and garter effects under the full, bouncy skirts.
   In a circus vein, he branched out into some loud and crazy
patchwork dresses with woolen balls and ribbons.
   The dressier silk or velvet outfits with Moroccan jewelry and
lace embroidery did not come off as well in this collection as the
beautifully finished simpler clothes. But the audience loved it all
anyway, and gave him a big hand for his peppy approach.
   In contrast to <PERSON>Lacroix</PERSON>'s exuberance, <LOCATION>Lolita Lempicka</LOCATION>'s
collection featuring mannish suits was down-to-earth to the point
of boredom.
   In greys and black pinstripes with ties, the outfits had long
pleated or short lean skirts, some of the jackets fitted, other
spencer-style for office chic. More mannish looks featured
trousers, making a comeback.
   Streamlined long and loose princess coat dresses were winning in
sober silvery grey, black or brown light wools.
   The satin and lace evening looks made an attempt at gaiety with
their bubbling scalloped skirts, but they didn't quite hit the
mark. And lace sleeves on man-tailored jackets over knit knickers
were not quite successful in their androgynous aim for a
masculine-feminine line.
   <PERSON>Doby Broda</PERSON> went in for sweaters on more sweaters _ a pullover
V-neck topped by a cardigan with a shoulder shrug, sometimes over
cuffed long or pedal-pusher pants. Her skirt lengths in low-key
outfits of mauve, beige or violet were either well above the knee
or nearly to the ankle.
   Kimijima's ``Venetian Carnival'' show was all in good fun,
especially the evening wear with huge peplumed bright taffeta
skirts, some harlequin-motif underskirts, and embroidered fitted
tops.
   <PERSON>Chantal Thomass</PERSON> _ known as ``queen of lingerie'' _ toned down
some of her risque touches in a bright, appealing show featuring
lots of pink angora and black stockings with vine-like motifs up
the front.
   Her wrapped tops over very short lean or bubbled skirts were
offset by some ankle-length numbers, often in soft pastel knits.
Equally appealing here might be the long and full cuffed pants and
the coats _ either full trapeze style or in sober charcoal and
white stripes fitted like short redingotes.

Nike's alleged efforts to monopolize the high-tech basketball
shoe market.
   L.A. Gear made the charges in a counterclaim filed in
federal court in Los Angeles yesterday in response to Nike's
recent patent-infringement lawsuit against it. Los
Angeles-based L.A. Gear said it could suffer damage of more
than $3 billion over the next three years if it is blocked
from the high-tech basketball shoe market.

YOUNG CANCER PATIENTS WRAP UP A MAGIC WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christmas music chimed through the <LOCATION>Glendale Galleria</LOCATION>. Santa Claus jounced 
toddlers on his knee. And seven children with cancer, four of them from <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> 
and three from <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, were on a shopping spree arranged by <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> 
police officers. 
</P>
<P>
"How about some of these?" Officer <PERSON>Gilbert Escontrias</PERSON> asked <PERSON>Mike Dighero</PERSON>, 
holding up a pair of jeans for the frail, 6-year-old <ORGANIZATION>Boyle Heights</ORGANIZATION> boy. 
</P>
<P>
The little boy looked less than thrilled -- then he caught sight of something 
else. 
</P>
<P>
"El nino <PERSON>Bart Simpson</PERSON>!" he shouted, ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he left the mall, <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> sported a <PERSON>Bart Simpson</PERSON> T-shirt and warm-ups, 
a <PERSON>Mickey Mouse</PERSON> hat and a pair of Reeboks. The rest of the group walked out with 
packages full of Barbie dolls, <ORGANIZATION>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Air Jordans</ORGANIZATION> and a 
<ORGANIZATION>Nintendo</ORGANIZATION> game. 
</P>
<P>
Advertising had brought the glamour of brand names into <LOCATION>East Los Angeles</LOCATION> 
housing projects and even into dirt-floored homes in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, where the onetime 
expense of a black and white television yields years of entertainment. But 
until <DATE>Friday</DATE>, for these seven families, the money to buy such products had 
remained out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, children who had never seen a department store, and in two cases, 
parents who had never shopped anywhere but public markets in a town square, set 
out for the mall. Each family had a mission to spend more than <MONEY>$250</MONEY>, which was 
raised by the <PERSON>Hollenbeck</PERSON> community relations unit of the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Police 
Department</ORGANIZATION>. The shopping spree was the climax of a five-day trip to <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> 
that included outings to <LOCATION>Disneyland</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Knott</PERSON>'s Berry Farm, and, for one 
15-year-old boy, an artificial leg. 
</P>
<P>
Such sprees are conceived as once-in-a-lifetime voyages into happy oblivion, a 
magical few hours where poverty and illness are left behind. On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, in 
fact, children seemed to forget the chemotherapy treatments and all the painful 
months in hospitals. They were no longer kids with cancer; they were kids at 
<LOCATION>Christmas</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Separated from their parents for part of the spree on the assumption that they 
would feel freer to buy what they really wanted without supervision, they asked 
excitedly for things whose names they had heard on TV, or from friends. 
Meanwhile, their parents -- a mom or dad accompanied each child on the trip -- 
were each given <MONEY>$100</MONEY> to spend on themselves and their families back home. 
</P>
<P>
The children started out in a shoe store, where the six boys each asked for 
favorite brands, in some cases according to the stars (<PERSON>Michaels Jackson</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Jordan</PERSON>) who had endorsed them. <PERSON>Raudel Gonzalez</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Jalisco</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, who lost one 
leg to cancer <DATE>last June</DATE>, couldn't stop smiling as he explained to the clerk 
that he was about to get another foot for the <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION> that was left in the shoe 
box. 
</P>
<P>
The only girl, <PERSON>Rocio Romero</PERSON>, 13, spurned "boys' shoes," and chose a pair of 
low-slung black boots. Rocio, who comes from a small town outside <LOCATION>Guadalajara</LOCATION>, 
said all her family shopping is done in the public market in her small town. 
She gazed longingly at a <MONEY>$69</MONEY> confection of pink nylon lace, but chose a more 
practical outfit, barrettes for her older sisters, and a neon T-shirt that said 
"<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>" across the chest. 
</P>
<P>
During this trip, children, who had never met one another and had little in 
common except those things they prefer to forget, turned into a kind of 
extended family. One frail 10-year-old, <PERSON>Salvador Gudino</PERSON>, who did not speak when 
he arrived, learned to use a telephone at the motel where they were staying, 
and kept ringing his new friends just to say hi. His mother, <PERSON>Juana Torres</PERSON>, 40, 
who described herself as a peasant with 10 children, went around saluting 
police officers with a "high five." 
</P>
<P>
In the <LOCATION>Glendale Galleria</LOCATION>, cancer proved easier to forget than poverty. 
</P>
<P>
As the boys walked through the aisles of a toy store, Officer <PERSON>Maria Martinez</PERSON> 
suggested that they avoid toy cars with batteries. The children understood 
instantly; batteries wore out and at home there would be no money for more. 
</P>
<P>
The three fathers, left alone to shop with their <MONEY>$100</MONEY> bills, chose gifts for 
their wives and outfits for the children left at home. 
</P>
<P>
The mothers, however, walked through <ORGANIZATION>J.C. Penney</ORGANIZATION> almost without touching 
anything. They glanced at one another over the counters full of holiday 
trinkets and assorted perfumes. They wended their way past ties for Dad and 
sequinned tops for New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
Still, they bought nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Torres and <PERSON>Elisa Romero</PERSON>, <PERSON>Rocio</PERSON>'s mother, each have nine other children at home. 
<PERSON>Mike</PERSON>'s mother, who lives in a housing project in <LOCATION>Boyle Heights</LOCATION>, has four other 
children. Would it be possible, they asked politely, to take the cash and spend 
it elsewhere? The store the police officers had chosen for its low prices was, 
they said, for "monied" people. 
</P>
<P>
On the way out, <PERSON>Romero</PERSON>, in one impulsive moment, picked up a small box of 
gift-wrapped perfumed soaps for <MONEY>$7</MONEY>. Guilt flashed across her face. But, after 
the tough going, even the toughened, a mother with the 10 mouths to feed, 
wanted to go shopping. Just this once. 
</P>
<P>
She smiled shyly at her companions. Then she handed the clerk her single, crisp 
<MONEY>$100</MONEY> bill.

<HEAD>Nike Plans to Spend $5 Million to Place Public Service-Type Ads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Nike Inc.</ORGANIZATION> plans to spend <PERCENT>17 percent</PERCENT> of its <MONEY>$30
million</MONEY> basketball shoe advertising budget this year on public
service-type messages encouraging youngsters to stay in school.
   The campaign comes at a time when some critics have blamed
high-priced athletic shoes for triggering crime in poor urban
areas. Some children wearing the shoes have been attacked by other
youngsters who covet them as status symbols.
   ``We know people that are in our ads are role models and kids
pay a lot of attention to our ads,'' said <PERSON>Liz Dolan</PERSON>, a spokeswoman
for <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION>. ``We felt this could be a real contribution that we could
make.''
   The <LOCATION>Beaverton</LOCATION>, Ore.-based athletic shoemaker said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> it
plans to spend <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY> to buy time for these messages and will
run them along with its regular product ads so they won't be
consigned to the least-watched times.
   <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION>'s public service messages would feature pro basketball
stars <PERSON>Michael Jordan</PERSON>, who has appeared for his own line of <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION>
shoes, and <PERSON>David Robinson</PERSON>, who is about to turn up in a new ad
campaign for <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION>'s Force line.
   <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>, who plays center for the <LOCATION>San Antonio Spurs</LOCATION>, told a
news conference he thought it was unfair to single out the makers
of athletic shoes for causing crime.
   ``Kids are attacking kids over a lot of things, not just
shoes,'' he said.
   He said the new ads give him a chance to become a positive role
model for children who may not have one.
   Prices for the <ORGANIZATION>Force</ORGANIZATION> line of shoes run from <MONEY>$58</MONEY> to <MONEY>$135</MONEY> a pair
with the major share of sales coming in the least expensive shoes,
<PERSON>Ms. Dolan</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION> brand marketing manager <PERSON>Ron Hill</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Force</ORGANIZATION> line
accounts for about <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION>'s <MONEY>$250 million</MONEY> a year in
basketball shoe sales.
   In the <MONEY>$15 million</MONEY> ad campaign for the line, which debuts in
late <DATE>April</DATE> on the <ORGANIZATION>NBA</ORGANIZATION> playoff telecasts, <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> is the amiable
focal point in his own ``<PERSON>Mr. Robinson</PERSON>'s Neighborhood,'' an apparent
takeoff on the children's public TV show ``<PERSON>Mister Rogers</PERSON>'
Neighborhood.''
   In one ad, Spurs Coach <PERSON>Larry Brown</PERSON> talks about the words for
that day, ``Transition Game.''
   Brown repeatedly admonishes <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> to run back down the court
after the opponent misses a shot as clips of <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> playing
basketball flash on the screen.
   ``I don't think we'll have Coach <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> on the show anymore,''
<PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> tells viewers as the commercial ends.
   Another ad in the series, called ``<PERSON>Kick Butt</PERSON>,'' is being held
until fall when the new inflatable <ORGANIZATION>Nike Force</ORGANIZATION> shoes are on the
market. The shoes have a built-in pump to inflate the collar around
the ankles; the shoes replace <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION>'s Air Pressure shoes that
required a separate pump.
   <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION>'s arch rival <ORGANIZATION>Reebok International</ORGANIZATION> sells a shoe called The
Pump that is inflated by pressing a marked spot on the tongue of
the shoe.
   In the ad, <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> demonstrates how to tie them _ ``<PERSON>Mr.
Robinson</PERSON> likes double knots'' _ and to inflate them _ ``<PERSON>Mr.
Robinson</PERSON> likes six pumps.''
   ``Then <PERSON>Mr. Robinson</PERSON> likes to take his special <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION> shoes onto
the court and kick some butt,'' the athlete says in an innocent
voice.
   ``Can you say `Kick some butt?''' he asks as the words flash on
the screen, interspersed with more shots of <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> in action on
the basketball court.
   <PERSON>Ms. Dolan</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION> feels viewers will understand that <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>
is talking about playing agressively, and doubts youngsters will
read more into it.
   ``I think everybody will get the joke,'' she said.

<LEADPARA>  Has anybody else noticed that today's big educational problem is not that
Johnny hasn't learned to read, but that he can't tie shoelaces? Oh, eventually
he will, but not until he's 8 or 9, when he first gets shoelaces. Until that
age, children's shoes all fasten with Velcro.;   I don't know why I say
"shoes." Children don't have shoes now. They have sneakers, and not the canvas
kind we had. These may be leather, and cost about as much as new feet.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  DISAPPEARING PRODUCTS SHOW HOW TECHNOLOGY ALTERS
LIVES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     I have taught a half-dozen children to tie shoelaces, not because I
remembered learning any better than their parents, but because I found a tutor
-- a helpful shoe salesman close enough in age to her first experience with
shoelaces to remember. It was completely different. You don't do each loop
separately now; you make two loops, one in each hand, then tie them together.;
  When something as elemental as the way shoelaces are tied changes in your
lifetime, you're up against a really galloping form of obsolescence. Instead
of just sitting around and talking nostalgically of things in common usage
during our parents' lifetime, we can now tally all that has disappeared during
our own.;   Some products have been outmoded by technology, which produces a
better model, and these days, does it faster than ever. Some products went out
of fashion. Some disappeared, in some cases replaced by an unexpected
alternative, part outgrowth, part chance.;   Most people think first of the
things that technology replaced with a better (faster, more accurate, easier)
means of getting to the same end. Gone, for example, are rotary dials on
telephones. Push buttons get callers to the numbers they want faster and more
accurately, and nowadays, can take them many other places besides. Records and
record players are virtually gone. Compact disc players deliver the same
music, but a better sound, and by a totally different mechanical means.;  
Cloth diapers were gone, but they're coming back. It turned out that
disposable diapers, for all their other virtues, aren't as disposable as
believed.;   Slide rules are definitely gone, replaced by electronic
calculators. But gone with them, and less easily replaced, said a scientific
friend, is something even more vital -- the need, and the continued ability,
to estimate.;   Not yet gone, but going, are passenger trains, unable to
compete with planes on speed or price or even service now. Again, something is
going with them -- leisurely travel, comfort, a close-up view of whatever lies
between here and there? And enough people feel the loss to keep a few clumsy
versions of them in business, if barely.;   Going also, if gradually, are
typewriters -- manual, electric, and even the electric versions desperately
posing as word processors. With them, of course, goes carbon paper, and good
riddance.;   With clotheslines will go clothespins; the wooden kind have
already vanished. Only poor people, unable to afford dryers, still have
clotheslines, as do the rich, who still have seasonal articles "aired" and
linens hung out for a "fresh" smell. Washtubs disappeared in our parents'
lifetime, and laundry tubs are disappearing from ours. Only a dozen of us
believe this a great loss.;   Just as many, if not more products, fell to
fashion, not technology. People simply wanted a different look, or were given
one, perhaps because of some practical advantage in cost or function.;  
Clothing styles are always changing, but rarely does a whole item vanish.
Girdles seem quite gone, and except for a nostalgic little resurgence, so are
stockings, firmly replaced by panty hose. Peds are not just gone, but almost
unknown. This is a test: What were Peds?;   Fitted bedspreads are gone,
probably because of the labor of fitting and piping those corners. Telephone
booths are almost gone, reduced to shallow body shields that save space and
material.;   Window shades have also disappeared, for no discernible reason,
considering their ineffective replacements. Eggbeaters are hard to find, also
retired unjustly. It's odd how many kitchen instruments have been replaced by
a motorized version no more effective, much bulkier, and harder to <LOCATION>wash.</LOCATION>;  
Explanations, even with hindsight, are often just guesswork. Many products
just evolved: A change or addition turned out to be practical for the
manufacturer and appealing to consumers.  </TEXT>
