<HEAD>Panel Hands Agent Orange Decision Back to Derwinski</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Veterans Secretary <PERSON>Edward J. Derwinski</PERSON> will
have to decide without the guidance he was looking for from an
advisory panel whether to award benefits to some <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans
exposed to Agent Orange.
   Derwinski is expected to make the decision around Thanksgiving
as the result of court-ordered regulations for determining the
relationship between exposure to the herbicide exposure and cancer.
   Nearly 12,000 disability claims once denied by the VA are now
pending as a result of a court order issued in <DATE>May</DATE> by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District
<PERSON>Judge Thelton E. Henderson</PERSON> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.
   Derwinski was looking for the <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Hazards Advisory
Committee</ORGANIZATION>, made up largely of scientists, to clear up some of the
arguments over Agent Orange.
   But the panel, in its first ruling on Agent Orange, acknowledged
<DATE>Friday</DATE> that it couldn't come up with a definite conclusion. The
committee said it ``does not find the evidence sufficient at the
present time to conclude that there is a significant statistical
association between exposure to (Agent Orange) and non-Hodgkins
lymphoma.''
   They added they ``cannot rule out such an association.''
   Veterans' groups blame Agent Orange for cancers that have turned
up years later in former soldiers who were exposed when the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> used it to clear jungle area in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> during the war.
   Veterans say their non-Hodgkins lymphoma, soft tissue sarcoma
and other forms of cancer were caused by the defoliant.
   The government has long said that cancers cannot be definitively
linked to Agent Orange. No studies have been undertaken looking at
veterans who were exposed to the chemical because government
scientists contend they cannot create such a sample.
   In his ruling in <DATE>May</DATE>, <PERSON>Henderson</PERSON> said the VA had used criteria
more stringent than <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> intended in a <DATE>1984</DATE> law that ordered
benefits to veterans exposed to the herbicide.
   The <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> has said the new regulations give <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> the freedom
to give veterans the benefit of the doubt absent any strong
recommendation by the committee, made up largely of scientists.
   The committee will meet in late <DATE>January</DATE> to address studies
covering Agent Orange exposure and soft tissue sarcomas as well as
porphyria cutanea tarda, an ailment that produces chronic skin
lesions. Those are the other two ailments addressed in <LOCATION>Henderson</LOCATION>'s
court ruling.
   Several of <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON>'s actions have been interpreted as signs
that he wants to take action, if only limited, in favor of
veterans. Those include his decision not to appeal the <DATE>May</DATE> ruling,
his appointment of retired Adm. <PERSON>Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr.</PERSON> as a special
adviser and his statements that he will give veterans the benefit
of the doubt.
   Zumwalt ordered spraying of Agent Orange during the war, and a
son who served in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> died of a cancer believed linked to
exposure.
   The <ORGANIZATION>American Legion</ORGANIZATION>, which has accused the panel of bias,
criticized <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s statement.
   ``They spent entirely too much time on crossing the t's and
dotting the i's,'' said <PERSON>Richard S. Christian</PERSON>, a deputy director of
the <ORGANIZATION>American Legion</ORGANIZATION>.
   The main suspect in Agent Orange is the contaminant dioxin, a
byproduct of industrial processes known to be an extremely potent
carcinogen in laboratory animals. Its effects on humans are less
well documented.
   Of the roughly 230,000 veterans who have told VA they were
exposed to Agent Orange, 635 have documented cases of non-Hodgkins
lymphoma, the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> says.
   There are 35,000 veterans seeking benefits for problems linked
to Agent Orange exposure.

<HEAD>Zumwalt Backs Compensation for Vets With Agent Orange-Related
Illness</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam veterans who suffered cancer and other
diseases after exposure to Agent Orange should receive disability
payments, says a government adviser who had ordered spraying of the
herbicide.
   Retired Adm. <PERSON>Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr.</PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION>Department of Veterans
Affairs</ORGANIZATION> advisory panel that he believed 27 cases of illness, mostly
cancers, could be sufficiently linked to Agent Orange exposure to
justify compensation.
   Zumwalt spoke to the <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Hazards Advisory Committee</ORGANIZATION> as
its newest member and as a personal adviser to Veterans Secretary
<PERSON>Edward J. Derwinski Jr</PERSON>.
   The committee on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> began reviewing scientific evidence
on the health effects of Agent Orange.
   Zumwalt speaks from a unique perspective: as commander of naval
forces in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, he ordered the spraying of the
dioxin-contaminated herbicide, which was used to deny jungle cover
to the enemy.
   In addition, <PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON>'s son, who served in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, died of a
cancer linked to Agent Orange exposure, and a grandson has birth
defects linked to exposure.
   Zumwalt urged the panel to take a fresh look at the scientific
evidence on Agent Orange. He also said a study he conducted for
<PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> parallels the work of an independent group of scientists
hired by three veterans' groups.
   That group, the <ORGANIZATION>Agent Orange Task Force</ORGANIZATION>, said this month there
was enough evidence to justify compensation for eight diseases or
ailments that have been linked to exposure. The panel said there
were 13 other health problems, mostly cancers, for which there is
sound evidence of connection but not yet enough evidence to justify
compensation.
   ``I suggest to you that any objective review by knowledgeable
experts in the field would predictably lead to much the same
conclusion,'' <PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON> said. He contended the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> panel lcked a
systematic approach or epidemiological perspective.
   Zumwalt went further, saying he believes 27 ailments, mostly
cancers, could be compensated using VA criteria that were adopted
as the result of a court order last year.
   The main diseases cited by the task force, <PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON> and others
are non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, <ORGANIZATION>Hodgkin</ORGANIZATION>'s disease, soft tissue sarcoma,
chloracne and other skin disorders, liver disorders, a metabolic
disorder known as porphyria cutanea tarda and birth defects.
   Zumwalt's list includes 13 kinds of cancer in addition to those
already cited.
   The <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> has said it will come up with final rules this year on
compensation. Derwinski must make the decision based on the
recommendations of the 15-member advisory committee, a panel of
scientists and lay people.
   The <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> decided in <DATE>March</DATE> to award compensation for 1,800 <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>
veterans with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. That decision was based on a
<ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION> study that found an increased risk of
the disease among <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans as a whole. The study was
inconclusive on Agent Orange exposure.
   About 36,000 claimants have been denied compensation despite
their contention that Agent Orange exposure caused their health
problems. About 240,000 say they have been exposed to the herbicide.
   The Zumwalt statement heartened congressional Vietnam-era
veterans who have pushed for legislation to award compensation.
   ``The evidence is there,'' said <PERSON>Sen. Tom Daschle</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-S.D.</LOCATION> ``The
only question left is whether or not the federal government is
willing to accept its responsibility.''

   Three kinds of cancer and five other diseases
among <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans can be traced to exposure to the defoliant
Agent Orange, according to a scientific report released <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by
veterans groups.
   The report, released on the eve of a congressional hearing on a
bill to pay benefits to Agent Orange victims, produced no new
evidence. Rather, it reviewed existing studies.
   Lawmakers pushing the benefits praised the study by the <ORGANIZATION>Agent
Orange Task Force</ORGANIZATION>, seven scientists assembled by the <ORGANIZATION>American
Legion</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Vietnam Veterans of America</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>National Veterans Legal
Services Program</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``It is not only appropriate but it is scientifically correct''
to award compensation to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans exposed to the
dioxin-containing defoliant, said <PERSON>Sen. John Kerry</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Mass.</LOCATION>, a
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veteran and sponsor of <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> legislation to award
compensation.
   The report said proof exists of a ``significant statistical
association'' between herbicide exposure and non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma; soft-tissue sarcoma; chloracne and other skin disorders;
early liver disease; and porphyria cutanea tarda, a metabolic
disorder.
   The scientists also said there was enough evidence to give the
benefit of the doubt in awarding compensation to veterans who were
exposed and suffer from <ORGANIZATION>Hodgkin</ORGANIZATION>'s disease, neurologic and
reproductive problems and developmental problems with their
offspring.
   They say there's limited evidence of an association between
exposure and a large number of cancers, as well as immunological
abnormalities and psychological problems.
   A <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> bill has been passed and a <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> bill introduced to
provide benefits to veterans who claim their diseases were a result
of exposure. The bills differ in cost _ <MONEY>$36 million</MONEY> for the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>
version and <MONEY>$89 million</MONEY> for the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> version _ length of coverage
and number of diseases covered.
   A Veterans Affairs subcommittee was scheduled to hear testimony
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> on the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> bill sponsored by Rep. <PERSON>Lane Evans</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Ill.</LOCATION>, a
co-chairman of the Vietnam-Era Veterans in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
   Both bills would create an independent panel of scientists under
the auspices of the independent <ORGANIZATION>National Academy of Sciences</ORGANIZATION> to
review herbicide studies. Critics say the government has
intentionally tried to influence the evidence on Agent Orange to
avoid paying benefits.
   VA Secretary <PERSON>Edward J. Derwinski</PERSON> has decided to award benefits
to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma sufferers who served in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. That
decision was made <DATE>March 29</DATE> as the result of a study by the <ORGANIZATION>Centers
for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION>.
   About 35,000 veterans have filed claims asserting a connection
between exposure and a variety of ailments. Only a handful _ those
for chloracne _ have been granted.
   About 240,000 veterans believe they may have been exposed to the
herbicide and have requested physical examinations, <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> says. A
total of 12 million gallons of Agent Orange was sprayed during the
war to remove ground cover and crops.
   Agent Orange is a phenoxyacetic herbicide contaminated with
dioxin during manufacture. Dioxin is the main disease-causing
suspect.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION> has labeled dioxin a
``probable human carcinogen.''
   The scientists on the panel say an influential private study of
<ORGANIZATION>Nitro</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>W.Va.</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Monsanto</ORGANIZATION> workers exposed to dioxin has been
discredited because of allegations of scientific fraud. So has an
important study of industrial workers in <LOCATION>Ludwigshafen</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West
Germany</LOCATION>, they said.
   The scientists were especially critical of the VA and <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> for
ignoring animal studies, especially because agencies such as the
<ORGANIZATION>EPA</ORGANIZATION> gives them such strong consideration.
   VA scientists say the animal dioxin studies are less reliable
because of the variety of reactions from species to species, and
because there is documented human exposure, said <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman
<PERSON>Donna St. John</PERSON>.
   The two bills cover only a few of the ailments: non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, melanoma and chloracne. The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>
version adds melanoma and basal cell carcinoma.
   <PERSON>Oliver Meadows</PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION>'s outside <ORGANIZATION>Environmental
Hazards Advisory Committee</ORGANIZATION>, dismissed criticism in the new report
that it ignored a large number of studies and that it used a
``simplistic tallying system'' to weigh data.
   The panel has only examined the connection between Agent Orange
and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The new report covers all the possible
ailments.
   The panel found in <DATE>November</DATE> that an association cannot be proved
or disproved. The <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> panel meets later this month to consider other
cancer studies.
   The <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> study of six kinds kinds of cancer found an increased
risk of only one _ non-Hodgkin's lymphoma _ among <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans.
It found no such increase in soft tissue sarcoma, <ORGANIZATION>Hodgkin</ORGANIZATION>'s
disease, and nasal, nasopharyngeal and primary liver cancer.
   The study looked only indirectly at Agent Orange exposure.

   A Vietnam-era commander who advises the
<ORGANIZATION>Veterans Affairs Department on Agent Orange</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> veterans
should be compensated for 27 cancers or other afflictions he says
were linked to the herbicide.
   Retired Adm. <PERSON>Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr.</PERSON>'s assessment came at the
opening of two days of hearings by a VA advisory committee on
health effects related to herbicide exposure.
   The panel's conclusions will help determine whether the VA will
award service-connected disability payments to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans
exposed to the dioxin-contaminated herbicide.
   The department has already decided to award compensation for one
related cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. That decision was based on
a congressionally mandated study of cancer among <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans.
The study, however, was inconclusive on Agent Orange exposure.
   Zumwalt was commander of naval forces in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, and ordered
that the herbicide be sprayed. His son, <PERSON>Elmo R. Zumwalt III</PERSON>, was a
patrol boat commander at the time and died two years ago at age 42
of cancer purportedly linked to exposure. A grandson suffers from a
birth defect also purportedly linked to exposure.
   Zumwalt has recently been an adviser to Veterans Secretary
<PERSON>Edward J. Derwinski</PERSON> and is a member of the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION>'s advisory <ORGANIZATION>Committee
on Environmental Hazards</ORGANIZATION>.
   He said his conclusions closely paralleled those of a group of
independent scientists retained by the <ORGANIZATION>American Legion</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Vietnam
Veterans of America</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>National Veterans Legal Services
Project</ORGANIZATION>.
   That group said <DATE>earlier this month</DATE> the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION>'s advisory <ORGANIZATION>Committee
on Environmental Hazards</ORGANIZATION> ignored a large body of data. The
scientists said they found evidence to compensate veterans for
eight ailments or diseases, and evidence to consider compensating
for 13 others.
   ``I suggest to you that any objective review by knowledgeable
experts in the field would predictably lead to much the same
conclusion,'' <PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON> said compensation could be justified for 27 afflictions,
including soft-tissue sarcoma, chloracne and other skin disorders,
liver disease, <ORGANIZATION>Hodgkin</ORGANIZATION>'s disease, neurologic defects, birth
defects, leukemia and 13 other cancers.
   Derwinski was still reviewing the private report from <PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON>
and could not comment on it, said spokeswoman <PERSON>Donna St. John</PERSON>.
   The government and veterans advocates have been at odds for
nearly a dozen years over the link between Agent Orange and various
diseases. The government <ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION> has concluded
that there is no way to determine which veterans have been exposed.
   Some <MONEY>12 million gallons</MONEY> of the herbicide was sprayed between
<DATE>1965</DATE> and <DATE>1970</DATE>. The herbicide was contaminated during manufacture
with dioxin, regarded by the <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION> as a
probable human carcinogen.
   More than 36,000 veterans have been denied claims as a result of
the impasse. Derwinski, in deciding not to appeal a court case a
year ago, paved the way for the issue to be reconsidered.
   In another development dealing with <ORGANIZATION>Agent Orange</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Internal
Revenue Service</ORGANIZATION> said it has declared non-taxable the payments to
veterans from a fund established in <DATE>1984</DATE> by herbicide manufacturers
as a result of a lawsuit. Some 60,000 servicemen who served in
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> from <DATE>1961 through 1972</DATE> or their survivors are eligible for
payments.

<HEAD>Report Criticizes VA's Refusal to Compensate Agent Orange-Related
Illness</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A report to Veterans Secretary <PERSON>Edward J.
Derwinski</PERSON> sharply criticizes the government for its longstanding
refusal to compensate <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans for illnesses linked to
Agent Orange exposure.
   The report by Admiral <PERSON>Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr.</PERSON> was released the same
day an advisory panel to the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Veterans Affairs</ORGANIZATION> paved
the way for compensation to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans suffering from a rare
cancer known as soft-tissue sarcoma.
   Derwinski is expected to decide in late <DATE>May</DATE> or early <DATE>June</DATE>
whether to award compensation for that form of cancer.
   ``I hope this is the beginning of the end of the nightmare Agent
Orange victims have suffered,'' said <PERSON>Sen. Thomas A. Daschle</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>D-S.D.</LOCATION>, a co-chair of the Vietnam-Era Veterans in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> caucus.
   The <ORGANIZATION>VA Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards</ORGANIZATION> made its
recommendation <DATE>Thursday</DATE> after reviewing scientific studies on the
connection between dioxin and herbicide exposure to soft tissue
sarcoma.
   Zumwalt, one of four lay members of the 15-member panel,
criticized the committee <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> for its previous handling of the
Agent Orange question. The panel was created by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1984</DATE> to
investigate the link between exposure and a host of ailments,
largely cancers, that <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans have been complaining about
since the <DATE>1970s</DATE>.
   A federal court order last year, which <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> declined to
appeal, forced the panel to begin its work anew. Although the last
<ORGANIZATION>Agent Orange</ORGANIZATION> was sprayed in <DATE>1971</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> has awarded only a handful
of Agent Orange claims, and those were all for a skin condition
called chloracne.
   Derwinski decided in <DATE>March</DATE> that all <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans with
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma should be compensated.
   The <ORGANIZATION>American Legion</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> Veterans of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> and outside
scientists commissioned by the two groups have long criticized the
government's refusal to acknowledge health hazards associated with
<ORGANIZATION>Agent Orange</ORGANIZATION>. The herbicide was contaminated with dioxin, labeled a
``probable human carcinogen'' by the <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Protection
Agency</ORGANIZATION>.
   On <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> released a report that <PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON> compiled for
<PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON>.
   ``Were the faulty conclusions, flawed methodology and noticeable
bias of the advisory committee an isolated problem, correcting the
misdirection would be more manageable,'' <PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON> wrote.
   ``But, experience with other governmental agencies responsible
for specifically analyzing and studying the effects of exposure to
Agent Orange strongly hints at a discernible pattern, if not
outright governmental collaboration, to deny compensation to
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans associated with exposure to dioxin,'' he wrote.
   Zumwalt referred to the <ORGANIZATION>federal Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION>,
given responsibility by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> for conducting Agent Orange
studies because of ``evidence of VA's footdragging.''
   Zumwalt repeated allegations raised in a congressional hearing
last <DATE>summer</DATE> that <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> sabotaged its Agent Orange study, suggesting
``that political pressures once again interfered with the kind of
professional, unbiased review <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> had sought to obtain.''
   Compensation for <ORGANIZATION>Agent Orange</ORGANIZATION> will cost nearly <MONEY>$90 million</MONEY> for
only a few of the ailments linked to the herbicide, the
<ORGANIZATION>Congressional Budget Office</ORGANIZATION> says.
   <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> has maintained it cannot establish who among <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>
veterans was exposed to Agent Orange, making further study
impossible.
   <PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON> said his own review of the scientific evidence suggests
28 ailments, mostly cancers, can be linked to Agent Orange exposure.
   Zumwalt, commander of naval forces in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, ordered the
spraying of the defoliant in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and lost a son, a <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>
veteran, to a cancer linked to Agent Orange exposure. Zumwalt has
said he nonetheless would have ordered the spraying because it
ultimately saved more lives than it cost.
   <PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON> said the herbicide was used in undiluted form to remove
enemy cover, destroy enemy crops and clear vegetation around
military installations, landing zones, fire base camps and trails.
   He said more was sprayed than records indicate, because of
unofficial uses of the herbicide.

<HEAD>Zumwalt Blasts Government Attitude on Dioxin Dangers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former commander who ordered the spraying of
Agent Orange in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> says veterans aren't the only ones to
suffer from the government's refusal to recognize the herbicide's
trail of cancer and birth defects.
   Testifying <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> before a <ORGANIZATION>House Government Operations</ORGANIZATION>
subcommittee, retired Adm. <PERSON>Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr.</PERSON> said the
government's attitude casts doubt on how honestly it is dealing
with dioxin exposure in the environment.
   Agent Orange, used in highly concentrated form to remove crops
and enemy cover, was contaminated during its manufacture with
dioxin, an unwanted byproduct that the <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Protection
Agency</ORGANIZATION> considers to be a probable cause of cancer.
   The federal <ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION>, however, says it cannot
study the health effects of Agent Orange exposure on veterans
because it is impossible to determine reliably who was exposed when
jungles were sprayed to deprive enemy troops of cover.
   Veterans groups contend that military records can match spraying
activities with troop movements. Agent Orange
   <PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON>, who commanded naval forces in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, reported to
Veterans Affairs Secretary <PERSON>Edward J. Derwinski</PERSON> in <DATE>May</DATE> that the
government and industry ``intentionally manipulated or withheld
compelling information on the adverse health effects'' associated
with exposure to the ingredients of Agent Orange.
   Key among those ingredients is dioxin, although scientists at
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s hearing said other contaminants may also be blamed for
cancers, birth defects and other afflictions.
   ``... The flawed scientific studies and manipulated conclusions
are not only unduly denying justice to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans suffering
from exposure to Agent Orange, they are now standing in the way of
a full disclosure to the American people of the likely health
effects of exposure to toxic dioxins,'' said <PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON>.
   He reiterated charges by outside scientists that two influential
industry-sponsored studies on plant accidents used fraudulent data,
and that scientists refuse to use animal data clearly showing a
connection between dioxin exposure and disease.
   ``While dioxin apologists concede dioxin's carcinogenic effects
on animals, they insist that humanity has a miraculous dispensation
from the harmful effects dioxin wreaks on other species of the
animal kingdom,'' he said.
   Derwinski retained <PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON> last fall as an unpaid adviser to
help resolve the Agent Orange question, which has been debated for
two decades.
   Since <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> took over last year as head of the <ORGANIZATION>Veterans
Affairs Department</ORGANIZATION>, compensation to veterans has begun.
   Without stating outright that Agent Orange exposure was the
cause, the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> has decided to compensate the few thousand veterans
with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and soft-tissue sarcomas, both rare
forms of cancer.
   <PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON> said in his report <DATE>May 5</DATE> to <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> that based on his
review of scientific literature, those two cancers and 25 other
afflictions should be considered to be linked to Agent Orange.
   Derwinski chose <PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON> because of his unique position. As a
commander, he ordered the herbicide to be used. Among those serving
in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> at the time were <PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON>'s son Elmo, who later died of
<ORGANIZATION>Hodgkin</ORGANIZATION>'s disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
   Other witnesses said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that more attention needs to be
focused on both key ingredients of Agent Orange, not just the one,
2,4,5-T, that was contaminated with dioxin.
   They said the other ingredient _ 2,4-D _ causes cancers and
other ailments linked to Agent Orange. Evidence shows that 2,4-D
was also contaminated with harmful compounds, some related to
dioxin, they said.
   A so-called phenoxy herbicide, 2,4-D is sold over the counter to
kill dandelions and other lawn weeds. Farmers use it against weeds
in corn, wheat, rice and sorghum.
   The farm-chemical industry believes further research into 2,4-D
is needed, but the ``weight of the evidence'' so far indicates the
risk of harm is relatively small if it exists at all, industry
spokesman <PERSON>Garry Hamlin</PERSON> said in a telephone interview from
<LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION>.

   <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s decision was based on the recommendations made by the
<ORGANIZATION>VA's Veterans Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards</ORGANIZATION>, a panel
of outside scientists and lay people. It found <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that there
is ``at least as likely as not'' a significant statistical
association between the disease and exposure to Agent Orange.
   The ruling in <DATE>March</DATE> was based on a study by the <ORGANIZATION>Centers for
Disease Control</ORGANIZATION> study of selected cancers. Researchers found a <PERCENT>50
percent</PERCENT> increased risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma among <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>
veterans, but the study looked only indirectly at whether Agent
Orange was the cause.
   The <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> study found no such increased risk for soft-tissue
sarcoma. But the advisory committee's examination of other
scientific literature relating to herbicide and dioxin exposure
tilted the balance in favor of compensation.
   ``I believe this is another step forward in resolving a most
difficult and emotional issue,'' <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> said. ``We intend to
proceed as quickly as possible to award compensation to these
veterans who are so deserving of our care and concern.''
   For years, Veterans have been seeking compensation for diseases
they say were caused by Agent Orange, a combination of two phenoxy
herbicides, one of which was contaminated with the byproduct dioxin.
   As many as 28 health problems, mostly cancers, can be associated
with exposure, according to Adm. <PERSON>Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr.</PERSON>, a special
adviser to <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON>.
   VA plans to publish its final compensation regulation for
soft-tissue sarcomas in early fall. An estimated 1,100 veterans or
their survivors are expected to receive compensation for
soft-tissue sarcomas to start with. An additional 50 claims
annually are expected thereafter, given the long latency period for
cancer.
   Soft-tissue sarcomas are a group of malignant tumors found on
muscles and connective tissue or in body fat.

<HEAD>Zumwalt Says Much More Defoliant Sprayed Than Recorded</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More Agent Orange was sprayed in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> than
official records show, a former commander said in a report <DATE>Thursday</DATE>
that also suggests ``a discernible pattern, if not collaboration,''
to deny veterans compensation.
   Also, a <ORGANIZATION>Veterans Affairs Department</ORGANIZATION> panel issued a ruling that
brings compensation closer to veterans exposed to the herbicide who
suffer from soft-tissue sarcoma, a rare cancer.
   Admiral <PERSON>Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr.</PERSON>, in his report to Veterans Secretary
<PERSON>Edward J. Derwinski</PERSON>, said he was certain from his experience that
more Agent Orange was spread than recorded.
   ``Combat units ... frequently conducted `unofficial' sprayings
of Agent Orange obtained from out of channel, and thus unrecorded
sources.'' said <PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON>.
   ``Additionally, as commander, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Naval Forces, <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, I was
aware that <ORGANIZATION>Agent Orange</ORGANIZATION> issued to Allied forces was frequently used
on unrecorded missions,'' <PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON> said in the report.
   The report, issued <DATE>May 6</DATE>, was released <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, a day after
<PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON> told an advisory panel to the VA he believes that 28
diseases are linked to Agent Orange exposure. Zumwalt, a special
adviser to <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON>, was recently named to the department's
<ORGANIZATION>Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards</ORGANIZATION>.
   The panel on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> determined it is as likely as not that a
significant association exists between soft-tissue sarcoma and
Agent Orange exposure.
   Derwinski is to decide by <DATE>June</DATE> whether to award disability
payments to veterans with that disease. Derwinski decided in <DATE>March</DATE>
that all <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma should be
compensated.
   The advisory committee in <DATE>August</DATE> will examine studies relating
dioxin and herbicide exposure to a skin disease known as chloracne,
and a metabolic disorder known as porphyrea cutanea tarda.
   The two reports make it likely that veterans will be compensated
for soft-tissue sarcoma. VA spokesman <ORGANIZATION>Bonner Day</ORGANIZATION> said the
department had no figure on how many Agent Orange claimants said
they have soft-tissue sarcoma.
   Zumwalt's report said the herbicide was used in strengths far in
excess of that suggested by the manufacturers. The makers have
settled a class-action lawsuit brought by afflicted veterans.
   He also criticizes government actions and studies on Agent
Orange, including the activities of the advisory panel.
   His broadsides backed up claims by veterans who have been trying
to get compensation for more than a decade and who claim the
government has had to be pushed to move and has ignored evidence
supporting links between Agent Orange and cancers.
   ``Were the faulty conclusions, faulty methodology and noticeable
bias of the advisory committee an isolated problem, correcting the
misdirection would be more manageable,'' <PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON> wrote.
   ``But, experience with other governmental agencies responsible
for ... analyzing and studying the effects of exposure to Agent
Orange strongly hints at a discernible pattern, if not outright
governmental collaboration, to deny compensation to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>
veterans for disabilities associated with exposure to dioxin.''
   Committee chairman <PERSON>Oliver Meadows</PERSON> said he would not comment on
the Zumwalt report.
   Zumwalt ordered the spraying of the defoliant in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and
lost a son, a <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veteran, to a cancer linked to Agent Orange
exposure.
   About 12 million gallons of the herbicide, which contained
cancer-causing dioxin, was sprayed from <DATE>1965</DATE> to <DATE>1970</DATE>, according to
records.
   <PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON> said, however, ``a significant, if not major source of
exposure was from non-recorded, non-Ranch Hand operations.'' Ranch
Hand was the name for the aircraft spraying operation.
   ``Evidence readily suggests that at the time experts knew that
Agent Orange was harmful to military personnel,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON> said that in addition to removing enemy cover and
destroying crops, the herbicide was sprayed to clear vegetation
around military installations, landing zones, fire base camps and
trails.

<HEAD>VA Compensation Decision Doesn't Resolve Agent Orange Controversy</HEAD>

   The decision by the <ORGANIZATION>Veterans Affairs
Department</ORGANIZATION> to award compensation to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans suffering from
one rare form of cancer doesn't resolve the dispute over exposure
to Agent Orange.
   The decision, announced <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, could make it possible for the
VA to close the doors to compensation for a host of ailments linked
to the herbicide used in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> from <DATE>1965</DATE> to <DATE>1970</DATE> to deny jungle
cover to the enemy.
   Based on a study released the same day by the federal <ORGANIZATION>Centers
for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Edward J. Derwinski</PERSON>
said he would award 100 percent disability payments to any <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>
veteran suffering from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
   Payments would be retroactive, and widows and children would
receive survivors' benefits as well. More than 1,800 veterans or
their survivors could receive compensation as a result, according
to <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> data, at a cost of <MONEY>$23 million</MONEY> the first year and about <MONEY>$25
million</MONEY> in subsequent years.
   Veterans advocates were pleased with the immediate decision but
remained skeptical about the study's application to the larger
Agent Orange questions. The government has insisted there is no
scientific proof of a link between the herbicide and a host of
ailments, mostly cancers.
   ``When the study was designed, <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> admitted that the study
population was significantly diluted with unexposed veterans, that
it lacked a meaningful measure of exposure and that it lacked the
statistical power to detect anything less than a <PERCENT>100 percent</PERCENT>
increase in certain cancers,'' said <PERSON>Sen. Thomas A. Daschle</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Daschle</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-S.D.</LOCATION>, is co-chairman of the Vietnam-Era Veterans in
<ORGANIZATION>Congress Caucus</ORGANIZATION> and wrote legislation to make the disease and
others suspected of having a link with <ORGANIZATION>Agent Orange</ORGANIZATION> exposure
service-connected.
   The <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> ``Selected Cancers Study'' looked at the occurrence of
cancer in all <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans in relation to men who did not serve
in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was the only cancer found in the
study to have had an unusually high incidence.
   Derwinski was initially very careful to say his decision was not
an Agent Orange decision, but he and his aides were fuzzier in
later remarks.
   Derwinski at one point said he made his determination based at
least in part on the work of a VA-commissioned panel of outside
scientists. That group reported <DATE>last November</DATE> that it could not
find, but neither could it rule out, a statistically significant
association between Agent Orange exposure and non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma.
   As a result of that finding, <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> had said he would
postpone a decision on Agent Orange compensation until after the
<ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> study. He had planned, however, to wait for the advisory
panel's recommendation in <DATE>May</DATE>.
   Derwinski jumped the gun <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, but he insisted the panel
would continue its work on the Agent Orange issue. Derwinski is
also consulting with <PERSON>Elmo Zumwalt</PERSON>, the retired admiral who ordered
Agent Orange spraying and whose son died of a cancer linked to
exposure.
   Some 36,000 Agent Orange claims have been made for the lymphoma
and other ailments have been made, and almost all have been
rejected. About 230,000 veterans have asserted they have been
exposed to Agent Orange.
   The <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> study left some questions unresolved. It noted, for
example, that <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> veterans were more inclined to get the disease
even though they were least likely to have been exposed to Agent
Orange. It also said the lowest incidence was among veterans of <ORGANIZATION>III
Corps</ORGANIZATION>, the area of highest Agent Orange use.
   <PERSON>John Hanson</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>American Legion</ORGANIZATION> official, said the study
neglected to point out that the <ORGANIZATION>III Corps</ORGANIZATION> area included <LOCATION>Saigon</LOCATION>,
which wasn't sprayed.
   Deputy Veterans Secretary <PERSON>Anthony J. Principi</PERSON> said VA was making
the presumption that any veteran who served in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> was exposed
to Agent Orange. But <PERSON>Hanson</PERSON> said such a determination dilutes any
statistical sample to the point where an Agent Orange determination
is impossible.

<HEAD>Scientists Testify That Weedkillers May be More Harmful Than
Thought</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Farmers and homeowners frequently use
weedkillers that contain a key ingredient of Agent Orange that may
be more harmful than previously thought, scientists told a
congressional panel <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   ``It appears to me that there are other contaminants in
herbicides, as well as herbicides per se, which have not been
adequately evaluated for carcinogenicity in animals let alone
studied for their effect ... in humans,'' <PERSON>Daniel Thau Teitelbaum</PERSON>, a
<LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> physician, told a <ORGANIZATION>House Government Operations</ORGANIZATION> subcommittee.
   Teitelbaum studied industry records as part of the class-action
lawsuit by <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans against the makers of Agent Orange.
   In the 20 years of controversy surrounding whether the
government should pay benefits to ailing <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans who were
exposed to Agent Orange, attention has focused on dioxin
contamination 2,4,5-T _ one of the herbicide's two key ingredients.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION> has labeled dioxin a
``probable human carcinogen'' and 2,4,5-T has been out of
circulation for years.
   But scientists told the subcommittee that the other key
ingredient _ 2,4-D _ causes cancers and other ailments linked to
Agent Orange. Evidence shows that 2,4-D was also contaminated with
harmful compounds, some related to dioxin, according to testimony
on the government handling of Agent Orange research.
   The farm-chemical industry says ongoing research into 2,4-D is
needed but that the ``weight of the evidence'' so far indicates the
risk of harm is relatively small if it does indeed exist, industry
spokesman <PERSON>Garry Hamlin</PERSON> said in a telephone interview from
<LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION>.
   A so-called phenoxy herbicide, 2,4-D is sold over the counter to
kill dandelions and other lawn weeds. Farmers use it against weeds
in corn, wheat, rice and sorghum.
   Teitelbaum, noting that use of 2,4,5-T was first discontinued
because of concern about birth defects, said studies were needed on
possible birth defects resulting from 2,4-D exposure.
   Two <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION> studies have shown an increased
risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a rare cancer, in ``frequent users
of agriculture chemicals,'' said <ORGANIZATION>NCI</ORGANIZATION> researcher <PERSON>Shelia Hoar Zahm</PERSON>.
   The studies of farm workers in <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> found that
the risk grows or drops according to skin exposure and how soon
after exposure the worker changed clothes.
   Vietnam veterans were exposed to Agent Orange in concentrations
far in excess of the normal strength, special adviser <PERSON>Elmo R.
Zumwalt Jr.</PERSON> has told the <ORGANIZATION>Veterans Affairs Department</ORGANIZATION>.
   The department said this year it would compensate veterans for
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and for another rare cancer _ soft tissue
sarcoma. However, the government maintains that exposure can't be
documented.
   Zumwalt, a retired admiral, ordered Agent Orange sprayed in
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> to clear dense jungle. His son, who served in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>,
later died of cancer, which <PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON> attributes to Agent Orange. he
said 27 ailments can be linked to Agent Orange.
   Zumwalt, appearing before the subcommittee on human resources
and intergovernmental relations, reiterated his contention that
government and industry officials ``intentionally manipulated or
withheld compelling information on the adverse health effects
associated with exposure to the toxic contaminants contained in
Agent Orange.''
   In a related matter, Rep. <PERSON>Ted R. Weiss</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-N.Y.</LOCATION>, said his
subcommittee had forced the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> to release a 4-year-old draft
report showing an increase of birth defects among the offspring of
those who handled and sprayed Agent Orange from the air.
   <PERSON>Patti Turner</PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force Surgeon General</ORGANIZATION>'s
office, said the conclusions were premature.

<HEAD>Veterans' Administration to Reconsider Agent Orange Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An advisory committee to the <ORGANIZATION>Department of
Veterans Affairs</ORGANIZATION> this week may open the door a crack to disability
benefits for <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans exposed to Agent Orange.
   Responding to a federal court decision in <DATE>May</DATE>, the 15-member
Veterans' <ORGANIZATION>Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards</ORGANIZATION> will look
again at scientific papers and studies on the herbicide used to
clear dense foliage that hid the enemy.
   This time, however, the committee will use standards considered
less strict than those used for determining other service-connected
disabilities.
   No one is predicting the outcome. But there is agreement that VA
Secretary <PERSON>Edward J. Derwinski</PERSON> wants to resolve the issue quickly
and in favor of veterans.
   ``I don't think he's going to fool around very long,'' <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION>
spokesman <PERSON>Don Smith</PERSON> said. ``He's so far exhibited a degree of
willingness _ if not impatience _ to go along rather rapidly with
this.''
   Once the committee does its work <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> is ``kind of on his
own as to how he wants to fly on this,'' <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said. He said
<PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> will make a final determination on the committee's
recommendations within two weeks of receiving results of the
meeting.
   According to one congressional source, <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON>'s actions mean
``he's almost promised people'' that he will take some positive
action for veterans.
   Veterans blame exposure to Agent Orange for cancers, skin
diseases and genetic damage leading to miscarriages or birth
defects. The committee will spend its first two days reviewing
about 20 or 30 studies on the connection between exposure and
non-Hodgkins lymphoma, one of the most frequently cited cancers,
then study other diseases at later meetings.
   On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, it will issue recommendations on non-Hodgkins
lymphoma and Agent Orange.
   The four-year-old advisory committee and government scientists
have thus far rejected a link between Agent Orange exposure and
health problems other than a skin condition known as chloracne.
   The <ORGANIZATION>American Legion</ORGANIZATION>, the prime veterans' group in this dispute,
contends the committee has a longstanding bias against veterans.
   Not so, says <PERSON>Oliver Meadows</PERSON>, the disabled veteran and scientific
layman in charge of the panel. ``Their greatest interest is their
own integrity as scientists,'' he said.
   The government says the main problem with studies up to now is
that there has been no way to verify exposure to dioxin. The
<ORGANIZATION>American Legion</ORGANIZATION> and others say the government has detailed records
on spraying activities that can be combined with equally detailed
records on troop movements.
   Agent Orange, an orange-brown liquid that was shipped in
orange-striped barrels, was sprayed in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> from <DATE>January 1965</DATE> to
<DATE>April 1970</DATE>. More than 230,000 veterans have registered with VA
claiming to have been exposed. More than 36,000 veterans have filed
for disability benefits claiming Agent Orange exposure caused their
problems, and two have been granted compensation _ for chloracne.
   Agent Orange is suspect because it contains ``phenoxy''
herbicides associated with certain cancers as well as dioxin, which
has been found to cause cancer in laboratory animals.
   Dioxin's links to human health problems are disputed, although
its links to human birth defects are more firmly established.
   A ruling in <DATE>May</DATE> by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Thelton E. Henderson</PERSON> in
<LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> created a way out of the impasse over <ORGANIZATION>Agent Orange</ORGANIZATION>. A
new administration and the elevation of the Veterans'
Administration to cabinet status added another ingredient.
   Henderson ruled <DATE>May 2</DATE> that the VA imposed an ``impermissibly
demanding test'' for linking Agent Orange with health problems.
   Although the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> has relied on a ``cause and effect''
relationship in determining service-connected disabilities, the
committee was to use a different standard: ``a significant
statistical association.''
   Derwinski told Attorney General <PERSON>Richard L. Thornburgh</PERSON> on <DATE>May 8</DATE>
that he had decided against an appeal.
   New regulations for reviewing studies using the new standard,
effective <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, say a link will be deemed to exist if the
studies associating Agent Orange with health problems outweigh the
evidence that there is no association.
   The regulations say the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> secretary can give the ``benefit of
the doubt to the conclusion that the association exists.''
   In early <DATE>October</DATE>, <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> named Adm. <PERSON>Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr.</PERSON> as a
special adviser with a specific emphasis on Agent Orange.
   Zumwalt ordered spraying of Agent Orange during <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, and he
lost a son who served in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> to a cancer linked with that
spraying. Zumwalt is known as a veterans' advocate on this issue.

<HEAD>Agent Orange Compensation Back in Federal Court</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dispute over compensating <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans
for a host of cancers and other ailments believed to be linked to
Agent Orange exposure is back in federal court.
   In a lawsuit filed here <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, two veterans groups asked that
federal scientists be forced to complete a study on the health
effects of Agent Orange on <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans and their children.
   The suit said the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration ordered the study
canceled in <DATE>1987</DATE>, four years after it began, because of concerns
that civilian claims against government and industry would follow a
decision to compensate veterans.
   The suit was filed in <ORGANIZATION>U.S. District Court</ORGANIZATION> by the <ORGANIZATION>American
Legion</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> Veterans of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, five individual veterans and
four surviving spouses.
   It said that without the study, mandated by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>, it
is impossible to persuade the <ORGANIZATION>Veterans Affairs Department</ORGANIZATION> to award
disability and death payments to thousands of veterans who were
exposed to the dioxin-contaminated defoliant.
   The herbicide, used to destroy ground cover and crops, has been
blamed by veterans groups for 19 cancers and a variety of other
health problems, including birth defects.
   The VA this year decided to award compensation for two rare
cancers: soft-tissue sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
   The soft-tissue sarcoma decision was based on the
recommendations of an advisory panel acting under a court order to
reconsider the scientific evidence. The lymphoma decision was based
on a <ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION> study of <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans that
only indirectly looked at Agent Orange exposure.
   Veterans Secretary <PERSON>Edward J. Derwinski</PERSON> said the lawsuit will set
back his effort to resolve the Agent Orange dispute. He began that
effort shortly after he took office by deciding not to appeal a <DATE>May
1989</DATE> federal court ruling that VA standards on Agent Orange
disability claims were too strict.
   The ruling in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> came as a result of a lawsuit filed
by the <ORGANIZATION>Vietnam Veterans of America</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Now, these organizations have acted to return to the courtroom
with litigation aimed at forcing the scientific conclusions they
want,'' <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> said. ``Their suit impugns the integrity of
respected scientists at the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION> whose
work thus far has added much to what we know about the health of
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION>, in canceling the study, said there was no
scientifically valid way to document who was exposed. The American
Legion and independent scientists say records of troop movements
can be matched with spraying records to find the likely exposed
veterans.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Department of Veterans Affairs</ORGANIZATION> opened the
door <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to independent scrutinity of its effort to determine
whether there is a link between exposure to Agent Orange and a
variety of diseases.
   The offer follows years of challenges to the credibility of the
<ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Department</ORGANIZATION>. Critics
have charged the government with ignoring the scientific evidence
of a connection between exposure and cancers and other diseases.
   The offer came during testimony by <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> Deputy Secretary <PERSON>Anthony
J. Principi</PERSON> before a <ORGANIZATION>House Veterans Affairs</ORGANIZATION> subcommittee.
   Principi told the subcommittee on compensation, pension and
insurance that the department would agree to a review by the
<ORGANIZATION>National Academy of Sciences</ORGANIZATION>, to having its own panel of outside
scientific advisers enlarged, or to subjecting its work to outside
review.
   Two Agent Orange compensation bills pending in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> call for
establishment of a scientific review procedure through the <ORGANIZATION>National
Academy</ORGANIZATION>, an independent group of scientists that advises the
government.
   ``Should <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> conclude that the process would be lent
credibility by our consulting with additional outside experts ...
we would be pleased to do so if that kind of consultation would not
unduly delay our progress,'' <PERSON>Principi</PERSON> said.
   But <PERSON>Principi</PERSON> also asked the subcommittee to put off
consideration of a compensation bill. The bill would award
service-connected disability payments to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War veterans who
contend they suffer due to exposure from one of four kinds of
cancer or from a skin disease known as chloracne.
   The bill would also pave the way to compensation for other
ailments as the evidence comes in.
   Principi asked that the law be held in abeyance until the VA
comes up with final regulations <DATE>Oct. 1</DATE> on who should be compensated
and for what diseases. Those regulations depend in part on the
recommendations of <ORGANIZATION>VA's Advisory Committee on Environmental
Hazards</ORGANIZATION>, a 15-member panel of scientists and lay persons.
   The committee meets later this month.
   Veterans Affairs Secretary <PERSON>Edward J. Derwinski</PERSON> has appointed his
personal adviser on the Agent Orange issue, retired Adm. <PERSON>Elmo
Zumwalt</PERSON>, to fill a vacancy on the committee. Zumwalt ordered
spraying of <ORGANIZATION>Agent Orange</ORGANIZATION> during <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and also lost a son who
served in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> to cancer.
   ``We have, I believe, more than demonstrated our good faith,''
<PERSON>Principi</PERSON> said, saying the VA set its course a year ago when it
decided against appealing a federal judge's order that it draft new
Agent Orange regulations.
   But the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> sponsor of the compensation bill, Rep. <PERSON>Lane Evans</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>D-Ill.</LOCATION>, suggested the VA was trying to further postpone delivering
benefits to veterans. There is no guarantee the department will
decide to award compensation in its final rules.
   ``I think you are proceeding on a good-faith basis, but I
believe the veterans who suffer from Agent Orange can't wait,'' he
said.
   <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>' bill would compensate exposed veterans who suffer from
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, melanoma, and basal
cell carcinoma, as well as chloracne. The measure is expected to
cost <MONEY>$89 million</MONEY> a year.
   About 35,000 veterans have filed claims asserting a connection
between exposure to Agent Orange and a host of ailments. Only a
handful of benefits have been granted, for those suffering
chloracne.
   Dioxin, labeled by the <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION> as a
``probable human carcinogen,'' is suspected as the primary but not
the only ingredient causing ailments among veterans exposed to
Agent Orange.

   Government scientists are expected to release
a study this week that will help determine officially whether
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans who were exposed to the herbicide Agent Orange
suffered cancers and other ailments as a result.
   The study by the <ORGANIZATION>federal Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION>, which the
<ORGANIZATION>Veterans Affairs Department</ORGANIZATION> says will be released <DATE>Thursday</DATE>,
examines the incidence of five kinds of cancer among <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> vets.
It is another step in a 12-year battle to gain benefits for
veterans who blame cancers, skin disease and miscarriages in their
spouses on the powerful foliage killer.
   VA Secretary <PERSON>Edward J. Derwinski</PERSON> last <DATE>November</DATE> said he would put
off a determination on whether to award benefits until after the
study was completed. Following its release, the study must be
reviewed by a VA advisory committee of outside scientists.
   Derwinski will make a determination at the end of <DATE>May</DATE> after the
committee meets, <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Don Smith</PERSON> said last week. Final rules
should be in place in <DATE>October</DATE>. The decision also could influence
legislation in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> requiring compensation to
veterans.
   <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> said in a recent interview that the decision on Agent
Orange will be the most difficult he's made since becoming the
first <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> secretary a year ago.
   ``The advice is so terribly conflicting,'' he said. ``There's no
consensus out there.''
   Nearly 35,000 claims have been filed citing Agent Orange as a
cause of disabilities. An additional 230,000 veterans have told VA
they were exposed to the herbicide, which contained highly toxic
dioxin and other suspected harmful ingredients.
   The new Selected Cancers Study by the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> does not
look at whether veterans were exposed to Agent Orange, which was
sprayed to remove foliage and kill crops.
   According to the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION>, the new study will determine whether
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans are at higher risk of developing soft-tissue
sarcoma, lymphoma and nasal, nasopharyngeal and liver cancer. The
study began in <DATE>1985</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Chuck Fallis</PERSON> said he could not confirm that the
study would be released <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, the day given by the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> and the
<ORGANIZATION>American Legion</ORGANIZATION>.
   VA says the study can be combined with other studies, mostly
dealing with the exposure of industrial and farm workers to dioxin,
to tilt the balance one way or the other regarding a possible
connection to disorders.
   The Legion, however, is telling veterans not to hold their
breaths.
   ``The government has ducked the issue of Agent Orange for more
than a dozen years,'' National Commander Miles <PERSON>S. Epling</PERSON> said. ``We
are tired of waiting for more studies, especially irrelevant ones.''
   The Legion contends the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> scuttled an earlier attempt at a
study by saying no reliable sample of veterans can be found. The
<ORGANIZATION>Legion</ORGANIZATION> says <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> has ignored detailed military records of troop
movements and spraying activities that could produce such a study
group.
   A Legion study claims to have established a connection between
Agent Orange and skin rashes and blisters, fatty tissue tumors,
hypersensitivity of the eyes to light, and an increased risk of
miscarriages among spouses. The <ORGANIZATION>Legion</ORGANIZATION> says the study was too
limited to reach further conclusions regarding other cancers.
   VA says scientific advisers to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and the administration
have rejected the Legion study because it relied on questionnaires
filled out by the veterans themselves.
   The Agent Orange issue was revived last <DATE>May</DATE> when <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District
<PERSON>Judge Thelton E. Henderson</PERSON> said VA had used too rigid a standard _
cause and effect between exposure and disease _ in evaluating Agent
Orange studies.
   Derwinski decided not to appeal <PERSON>Henderson</PERSON>'s order that the VA
need only find a ``significant statistical association'' between
exposure and disease before determining to award compensation.
   The <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION>'s outside <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Hazards Advisory Committee</ORGANIZATION> met in
<DATE>November</DATE> to review about 30 studies dealing with herbicide exposure
and its relation to non-Hodgkins lymphoma using the new criteria.
   The group said it could neither find nor rule out a significant
statistical association, giving little guidance to <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> said afterward he would wait for the new <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> study. He
cited remarks by members of the committee that such a study would
be useful.

   A long-awaited government study of cancer among
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans found no evidence linking the disease with
exposure to the herbicide Agent Orange, officials said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The study by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION>, which looked
only indirectly at Agent Orange, did find veterans at increased
risk of a relatively rare cancer called non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. But
researchers noted the risk was greater among veterans who served on
ships than those who served on land, where the herbicide was used.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, Veterans Secretary <PERSON>Edward J. Derwinski</PERSON> quickly
said he would order the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Veterans Affairs</ORGANIZATION> to pay
disability compensation to vets suffering from non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma.
   The study was immediately attacked by veterans groups, which
complained it failed to sufficiently examine the cancer risks among
the thousands of soldiers who actually worked with the dangerous
herbicide during the war.
   ``It is not an Agent Orange study,'' objected <PERSON>Mary R. Stout</PERSON>,
president of the <ORGANIZATION>Vietnam Veterans of America</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``This is only a look at <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans'' who had cancer,
added <PERSON>John Hansen</PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>American Legion</ORGANIZATION>.
   And <PERSON>Sen. Tom Daschle</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-S.D.</LOCATION>, co-chairman of the Vietnam-Era
Veterans in <ORGANIZATION>Congress Caucus</ORGANIZATION>, said: ``This action has been a long
time coming. However, it is not the final word. We cannot forget
the many other veterans who are also suffering and dying from Agent
Orange-related diseases and who have just as much evidence
supporting their claims.''
   Agent Orange, sprayed by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military to remove jungle
cover and crops in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, contained dioxin, a highly toxic
chemical which some studies have found to increase cancer risks.
   Criticism of the study focused on its methods, which involved
comparing cancer patients of Vietnam-veteran age to healthy
counterparts.
   The study ``only indirectly evaluated'' Agent Orange exposure,
because of the technical difficulties in determining <DATE>two decades
later</DATE> how much a patient may have been exposed to the herbicide,
the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Specific analysis of dioxin exposure was impractical, partly
because researchers don't know how cancer may skew the results of
blood tests for dioxin levels, said <PERSON>Dr. Daniel A. Hoffman</PERSON>,
assistant director for science at the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Center for
Environmental Health</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Our study was designed to look at <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> experience and
history, and secondly to ascertain the likelihood of exposure,''
<PERSON>Hoffman</PERSON> said.
   The study, conducted over five years, surveyed 2,067 cancer
patients who were of approximate <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> service age _ between 15
and 39 in <DATE>1968</DATE>, at the height of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troop involvement. They were
compared to 1,776 men of similar age who had no history of cancer.
   Both groups were studied for risk of six kinds of cancer,
including soft tissue cancer and similar sarcomas, a group of
cancers that the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> concedes has been ``of great concern among
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans.''
   Vietnam vets were found to have a roughly <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> increased
risk for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
   ``The study did not find any evidence that the increased risk
might be due to Agent Orange exposure,'' said <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON>William
L. Roper</PERSON>.
   That conclusion, the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> said, came in part because the cancer
risk among <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans ``seemed to be the opposite of the
pattern for use of Agent Orange.''
   Vets from the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>'s ocean ships had somewhat higher cancer
risks than those who served on land. And veterans from the region
of heaviest Agent Orange use were at ``somewhat lower risk'' than
others, the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Specifically, the yearly risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is about
one in 10,000 for men <DATE>35-59</DATE>, the age group of most <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> vets.
The risk for <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> vets overall is about 1.5 per 10,000, <PERSON>Roper</PERSON>
said.
   The risk nearly doubled _ <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> higher _ for <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> veterans
stationed on ocean ships.
   The <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> higher risk is what epidemiologists call ``a weak
association,'' <PERSON>Hoffman</PERSON> said: It is statistically significant, but
``anything less than a twofold increase can sometimes be caused by
other factors.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> found ``no increased risk'' for sarcomas, usually
cancers of the body's connective tissues, or for other cancer types.
   The VA had been awaiting the study before deciding whether to
award benefits to vets exposed to Agent Orange. Nearly 35,000
claims have been filed citing the chemical as a cause of
disabilities including cancer, skin disease and miscarriages by
soldiers' wives.
   In announcing the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma benefits, <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON>
mentioned only the link between <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> service and the lymphoma.
He didn't say the connection was because of Agent Orange.
   Payments, which would be retroactive, are expected to cost <MONEY>$23
million</MONEY> the first year and <MONEY>$25 million</MONEY> a year in succeeding years,
VA officials said. Based on the study, the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> estimated 1,800
veterans are due compensation, and there will be 450 new cases each
year.
   The complaints before the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> aren't the only ones about Agent
Orange. A class-action lawsuit against the seven manufacturers of
Agent Orange was settled in <DATE>1984</DATE> in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District Court in <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION>, and payments began last year.
   The court has estimated that 30,000 veterans and 18,000 survivor
families would be eligible for benefits from a settlement fund of
at least <MONEY>$240 million</MONEY>.
   The settlement's court-appointed administrator, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>
attorney <PERSON>Kenneth Feinberg</PERSON>, had yet to see the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> study and
couldn't say what effect, if any, it might have on the case, his
office said.

   WASHINGTON -- The Department of Veterans Affairs for the
first time acknowledged a link between cancer and exposure to
Agent Orange, a herbicide used in the Vietnam War, and
announced it will pay disability benefits to Vietnam veterans
with soft-tissue sarcomas.
   In March, the VA said it would grant disability benefits
to Vietnam veterans with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, another rare
cancer. It was the first time the government recognized a
connection between cancer and service in Southeast Asia. That
conclusion was based on a Centers for Disease Control study
that found a correlation between non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and
service in Vietnam.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> study didn't find any connection betwen
exposure to Agent Orange and cancer. Veterans groups have
long contended that exposure to Agent Orange has led to a
higher incidence of cancer among <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans, and in its
ruling <DATE>Friday</DATE>, the VA department conceded that there may be
such a connection.
   The latest decision rejects part of the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> study, which
didn't find a link between service in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and five other
cancers, including soft-tissue sarcomas. But a VA advisory
committee reviewed scientific literature on the connection
between soft-tissue sarcomas and exposure to herbicides
containing dioxin and recommended that cancers be considered
service-connected and eligible for benefits.
   The ruling by <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Edward Derwinski</PERSON> means that
approximately 1,100 veterans or their survivors will qualify
for compensation. The department estimates it will recognize
an additional 50 new claims a year for soft-tissue sarcomas,
which are difficult-to-diagnose tumors found on muscles and
connective tissue or in body fat. The VA projects it will pay
about <MONEY>$8 million</MONEY> a year as a result of the decision.

   The <ORGANIZATION>Department of Veterans Affairs</ORGANIZATION> is taking
another look at the cases of all <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans whose benefits
claims due to exposure to Agent Orange were denied, and easing the
standards for receiving compensation.
   The change became known <DATE>Thursday</DATE> when <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Edward
Derwinski</PERSON> said the government will not appeal a federal judge's
decision earlier this week that struck down regulations restricting
compensation for victims of Agent Orange.
   <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON>'s decision was seen as a major step toward disability
benefits for some of the more than 34,000 veterans of the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>
War who have unsuccessfully sought to have the government admit
their exposure to the toxic herbicide has caused health problems.
   <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> will follow the judge's instructions to
review all previously denied claims and use new, statistical
standards to decide whether specific diseases are presumed to have
been caused by Agent Orange exposure.
   ``It's a very significant step,'' said <PERSON>Mary Stout</PERSON>, president of
the <ORGANIZATION>Vietnam Veterans of America</ORGANIZATION>, a 35,000-member group that filed
suit over the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION>'s denial of benefits in Agent Orange cases. ``I
think it does show that there's a new Veterans Administration and a
new administration that's taking a different view of the Agent
Orange situation.''
   Agent Orange was widely sprayed by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> as a
defoliant. Its medical effects years and decades later on the
soldiers who handled it or were exposed to it have been the subject
of intense legal and scientific debate.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Thelton Henderson</PERSON> ruled this week in <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION> the VA had used an ``impermissibly demanding test'' in
requiring proof of a cause-and-effect relationship between exposure
to Agent Orange and specific diseases.
   Instead, he said, the agency should require only a finding of a
statistically significant correlation or ``increased risk of
incidence'' _ a less difficult standard to meet.
   Derwinski, a veteran and former member of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, said he had
begun ``a good hard look'' at the department's Agent Orange policy
even before the federal judge's ruling. He said he concluded it was
not good policy and ``frankly not good politics'' to fight the
ruling.
   VA officials said the department will direct its 11-member
scientific committee that reviews Agent Orange issues to take a new
look at all scientific and medical studies of Agent Orange using
the new statistical standard.
   <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> said he expected final decisions on the diseases by
<DATE>October</DATE>.
   Deputy Secretary <PERSON>Anthony Principi</PERSON> said the VA would consider any
veteran who served in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> to have been exposed to Agent Orange
and would not require specific proof they were in an area where the
herbicide was sprayed.
   The department, which until this year was known as the <ORGANIZATION>Veterans
Administration</ORGANIZATION>, has consistently held that only one disease, a skin
condition known as chloracne, was caused by exposure to <ORGANIZATION>Agent
Orange</ORGANIZATION> during military service.
   As a result the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> has denied disability compensation for
veterans who claimed exposure to other diseases, including cancer.
The <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> has provided medical treatment for those conditions, however.
   Whether those cancers and other illnesses can be linked
statistically to Agent Orange exposure has been a matter of
dispute. Derwinski's decision puts that question before the VA's
panel of scientists and other experts, which had concluded there
was no scientific link based on the previous standard.
   Derwinski and other VA officials said they had no way to
estimate the potential cost to the government in added benefits to
veterans if the panel agrees to a statistical assumption that
additional diseases were caused by Agent Orange exposure.
   ``The cost is irrelevant,'' <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> said.
   Rep. <PERSON>G.V.</PERSON> ``Sonny'' <PERSON>Montgomery</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Miss.</LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>House
Veterans Affairs Committee</ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON>'s decision was in line
with congressional wishes that compensation be decided ``on the
basis of sound scientific and medical evidence.''
   ``The judge has said that the department has written the
regulations too narrowly and the department has agreed to go back
and rewrite them,'' <PERSON>Montgomery</PERSON> said. ``I think the secretary has
made the right decision.''
   Of the claims related to Agent Orange already filed, nearly
7,000 involve three main categories of illness _ non-Hodgkins
lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma and a liver ailment known as PCT _
for which some contend links to Agent Orange have been established.

<HEAD>Study: Vietnam Military Dogs Had Almost Twice as Many Testicular
Tumors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dogs exposed in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> to the same chemical
sprays as <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> soldiers developed almost twice as many tumors of
the testicles as military dogs that served only in the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>, federal investigators report.
   In a study published <DATE>today</DATE> in the Journal of the <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer
Institute</ORGANIZATION>, researchers said the increased number of testicular
cancers among canine veterans of <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> may predict the
development of such tumors among American servicemen who served in
the same country.
   ``The dog is a sentinel model for man,'' said <PERSON>Howard M. Hayes</PERSON>, a
<ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION> researcher and coauthor of the report.
``He could be used to foretell the risks for exposure to the same
chemical insults'' encountered by soldiers in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Hayes</PERSON> and his coauthors examined autopsy records for dogs that
served with American troops in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> from <DATE>1968</DATE> to <DATE>1973</DATE>. They also
examined autopsy records of dogs that served in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and later
died elsewhere.
   These records then were compared with those of military dogs
that served only in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Hayes</PERSON> said the dogs serving in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> had <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> more
testis tumors of all kinds than did dogs that served only in the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. The <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> dogs also had <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> more seminomas,
a malignant tumor of the testis.
   Dogs serving in <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> had fewer of both
types of tumors than did the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dogs.
   To further verify the risks, <PERSON>Hayes</PERSON> said his group examined
records of 96 male dogs that served in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and died elsewhere
between <DATE>1974</DATE> and <DATE>1978</DATE>. These records were compared with those of
dogs that served only in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and died during the same
period.
   ``We observed the 96 <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veteran military working dogs to
have significant excess risk for seminoma, which supported the
findings in the earlier period,'' the report said.
   Additionally, the study showed that dogs that served in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>
had <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>100 percent</PERCENT> more testicular dysfunction than did
dogs that served only in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Hayes</PERSON> said about <PERCENT>99 percent</PERCENT> of the military dogs in the study
were German shepherds, a breed that has a predisposition to
testicular tumors.
   As a result, he said, the dogs ``may be a particularly sensitive
sentinel for exposures leading to increase seminoma risk in man.''
   Dogs in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Hayes</PERSON> said, served side-by-side with infantry
troops and were exposed to the same chemical sprays, such as the
herbicide Agent Orange, as were the soldiers.
   Unlike most of the humans, however, the dogs' tours in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>
were not limited to one year.
   Additionally, <PERSON>Hayes</PERSON> said the dogs in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> were treated
several times with tetracycline, an antibiotic used to control a
tick-borne parasitic disease. The tetracycline, the study said,
``may have contributed to the increased risk of testicular
problems.''
   Veterans' groups have contended for years that soldiers who
served in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> have experienced more cancers and other ailments
as a result of their exposure to chemical sprays while in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>.
Agent Orange, an herbicide widely used to defoliate the jungle, has
come under particular attack by veterans' groups as the cause of
cancers and skin ailments.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Department of Veterans' Affairs</ORGANIZATION> announced earlier this year
that it would provide compensation to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans who have
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or soft-tissue sarcoma, two cancers that
have been associated with chemicals in Agent Orange.
   Adm. <PERSON>Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr.</PERSON>, a special adviser to Veterans
Secretary <PERSON>Edward J. Derwinski</PERSON>, said in an interview that there now
is no compensation provided to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans who develop
testicular cancers. He said the new study may cause tumors of the
testis to be considered as possibly service-related illnesses for
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans.
   ``I've already recommended that testicular cancer be included
and this (the <LOCATION>Hayes</LOCATION> study) is powerful evidence in support of it,''
he said.
   Zumwalt had a son who served in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and later died of
cancer, which <ORGANIZATION>Zumwalt</ORGANIZATION> attributed to Agent Orange.

   The <ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>today</DATE> its
long-awaited study of Agent Orange shows <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans at
increased risk of only one type of cancer _ and ``no evidence''
that the risk stems from exposure to the dangerous herbicide used
in the war.
   The study, which had been criticized by veterans groups even
before it was released, focused on <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans and cancer, and
``only indirectly evaluated Agent Orange exposure,'' the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> said.
   But it added that the cancer risk among the vets in the study
``seemed to be the opposite of the pattern for use of Agent
Orange.'' Veterans who served on <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> ships were somewhat more
likely to get cancer than those who served on land, and veterans
who served in the region of heaviest Agent Orange use were at
``somewhat lower risk'' than others, the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Agent Orange, sprayed by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military to remove jungle and
crops in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, contained dioxin, a highly toxic chemical that
some studies have found to increase the risk of cancer.
   The <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> study, conducted over five years, surveyed male cancer
patients who were the right age to have served in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, whether
they did serve or not. They were compared with a group of similar
males with no history of cancer.
   The patients' medical records were examined for six kinds of
cancer, including soft tissue cancer and similar sarcomas, a group
of cancers which the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> concedes has been ``of great concern among
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans.''
   Vietnam vets were found to be at a roughly <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> increased
risk for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a ``relatively rare'' cancer of
the lymphatic system, the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> said.
   ``The study did not find any evidence that the increased risk
might be due to Agent Orange exposure,'' said <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON>William
L. Roper</PERSON>.
   There was ``no evidence,'' the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> reported, ``that
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was more likely to develop in one group of
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans than in another.''
   Specifically, the yearly risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is about
one in 10,000 for men 35 to 59, the age group of most <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> vets.
The risk for <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> vets is about 1.5 per 10,000, <PERSON>Roper</PERSON> said.
   But the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> found ``no increased risk'' for sarcomas, usually
cancers of the body's connective tissues, or for other cancer types.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Veterans Administration</ORGANIZATION> has been awaiting the study before
making its decision on whether to award benefits to veterans
exposed to Agent Orange. Nearly 35,000 claims have been filed
citing the chemical as a cause of disabilities, including cancer,
skin disease and miscarriages by veterans' wives.
   Veterans Secretary <PERSON>Edward J. Derwinski</PERSON> said <DATE>today</DATE> that based on
the study he would order compensation paid to veterans suffering
from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
   Derwinski, in announcing the move in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, mentioned only
the link between <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> service and the lymphoma. He did not say
the connection was because of Agent Orange.
   His announcement speeds up VA action on the findings; the agency
had said it would submit the study to a review panel.
   American Legion officials told their <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veteran members in
advance of today's announcement that they should not be too
optimistic about this study, which was mandated by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The government has ducked the issue of Agent Orange for more
than a dozen years,'' said the legion's national commander, <ORGANIZATION>Miles
S. Epling</ORGANIZATION>. ``We are tired of waiting for more studies, especially
irrelevant ones.''
   The legion has accused <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> of ignoring military records that
could have produced a more detailed study.
   The <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> study found that the risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was
nearly double _ <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> higher _ for <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> veterans stationed on
ocean ships than for non-veterans. That was the only statistically
significant risk for any branch of service, said <PERSON>Dr. Daniel A.
Hoffman</PERSON>, assistant director for science at the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Center for
Environmental Health</ORGANIZATION>.
   For all veterans, the <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> higher risk of that type of
cancer is what epidemiologists call ``a weak association,'' <PERSON>Hoffman</PERSON>
said. While statistically significant, ``anything less than a
twofold increase can sometimes be caused by other factors,'' he
said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> study did not suggest reasons for the increased risk for
one cancer over another, or for the increased risk among <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>
sailors at sea.
   The study did not include blood tests to determine the actual
amount of dioxin that might remain in the cancer patients'
bloodstream two decades or more after military service.
   <PERSON>Hoffman</PERSON> said such tests were not a practical way to determine
dioxin exposure because it is possible that test findings might be
tainted by the patients' illness itself.

<TEXT>
   Adm. <PERSON>Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr.</PERSON>, whose son died of
cancer after being exposed to Agent Orange that his father had
ordered sprayed in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, has been named a senior adviser to
Veterans Affairs Secretary <PERSON>Edward J. Derwinski</PERSON>, the department said
<DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   The appointment of <LOCATION>Zumwalt</LOCATION>, 68, is one of several steps the <ORGANIZATION>VA
department</ORGANIZATION> has taken under <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> to address the concerns of
veterans who have health problems that they say are linked to
exposure to the defoliant.
   The <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON> will counsel on a variety of issues, but
``the first on the agenda will be Agent Orange.''
   <PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON>, who retired as chief of naval operations in <DATE>1974</DATE>, was
commander of in-country naval forces in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> in the <DATE>late 1960s</DATE>,
when Agent Orange was sprayed in the <ORGANIZATION>Mekong Delta</ORGANIZATION>.
   His son, <PERSON>Elmo R. Zumwalt III</PERSON>, had served as a patrol boat
commander at the same time. He died in <DATE>August 1988</DATE> of a form of
cancer linked to Agent Orange exposure. He was 42.
   A grandson, <PERSON>Elmo Russell Zumwalt IV</PERSON>, suffers from a congenital
dysfunction of his physical senses. Agent Orange has also been
blamed for birth defects.
   The father has said he still would have ordered spraying the
defoliant because overall casualties were reduced.
   The two co-wrote a book, ``My Father, My Son,'' about the
experience. It was later made into a television movie.
   On <DATE>Monday</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>VA Department</ORGANIZATION> published regulations creating
less-stringent guidelines for determining whether there is a link
between Agent Orange exposure and a host of ailments. A <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> panel
will re-examine studies in <DATE>November</DATE> in light of the new guidelines.
   Government scientists have said there is no way of determining a
positive link, a position challenged by veterans groups and outside
scientists. The <ORGANIZATION>American Legion</ORGANIZATION>, for example, has released a major
study showing that exposure is related to benign fatty tumors,
adult acne, skin rash with blisters, several other ailments and an
increased risk of miscarriages in wives of veterans.
   Although the study said it couldn't determine a link with cancer
because the sample was too small, the legion said the methodology
proved such a study could be made.
   The new regulations allow for a link to be established if
studies ``permit the conclusion that it is at least as likely as
not that the purported relationship between a particular type of
exposure and a specific adverse health effect exists.''
   Some 35,000 veterans have filed Agent Orange claims, but only
five have been allowed because of the policy that no firm
connection exists. More than 230,000 veterans have reported their
exposure to the <LOCATION>VA</LOCATION>. About 2.6 million personnel served within the
borders of <LOCATION>South Vietnam</LOCATION>.

   <PERSON>David Maier</PERSON> believes he lost his arm in the service of his
country. His country, until now, has disagreed.
   The arm _ a casualty of cancer, not combat _ was amputated at the
shoulder seven years after <PERSON>Maier</PERSON>'s discharge from the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>.
   But the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veteran, now 46 and living in <LOCATION>Bay Village</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>,
puts the blame for his cancer on Agent Orange, the toxic herbicide
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops sprayed over the jungles of southeast <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>. He is
convinced it was awash in the coffee-colored <LOCATION>Mekong River</LOCATION> water
pumped aboard his ship for showers.
   Like more than 34,000 other <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans who believe they
have become ill because of Agent Orange, <PERSON>Maier</PERSON> applied for
government disability benefits. And like all but five of those
applicants, he was denied.
   Now <PERSON>Maier</PERSON> hopes his claim will be reconsidered, thanks to a
federal judge's ruling in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> <DATE>last month</DATE> that found the
government failed to give Agent Orange claimants the benefit of the
doubt.
   To the surprise of many veterans, the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration decided
not to appeal. Instead, Veterans Secretary <PERSON>Edward Derwinski</PERSON>
announced that the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Veterans Affairs</ORGANIZATION>, the new name for
the <ORGANIZATION>Veterans Administration</ORGANIZATION>, would rewrite its rules for granting
disability.
   Derwinski's decision could open the door to claims from hundreds
of thousands of <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans.
   Although 34,000 have applied for disability on the basis of Agent
Orange exposure, about 250,000 veterans are listed in a registry of
those who believe they were exposed to the herbicide. Many never
applied because they believed they didn't stand a chance of getting
disability.
   Officials for some veterans' organizations say they're cautiously
optimistic that the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> has changed its attitude along with its name.
   ``It is our feeling at this point that Secretary <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> really
does want to see some change,'' said <PERSON>Barry Kasinitz</PERSON>, a spokesman for
<ORGANIZATION>Vietnam Veterans of America</ORGANIZATION>, the group that brought the lawsuit in
<LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.
   Others remain skeptical, their attitude reflecting the deep
bitterness that many <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans feel toward a government that
they believe used and abandoned them.
   ``We'll believe it when we see it,'' said <PERSON>James Sparrow</PERSON>, the
executive director of <ORGANIZATION>Vietnam Veterans Agent Orange Victims</ORGANIZATION>, an
advocacy group based in <LOCATION>Stamford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn</LOCATION>.
   ``It's my feeling that they'll probably do as little as they
can,'' said <PERSON>Sandra Hosty</PERSON>, an attorney for Swords to <LOCATION>Plowshares</LOCATION>, a
<LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> group that provides counseling and representation for
veterans seeking benefits.
   Still, <PERSON>Ms. Hosty</PERSON> added, ``I would love to be surprised. I would
love to be wrong.''
   Agent Orange, named for the orange-striped drums in which it was
stored, was developed for the military in the early <DATE>1940s</DATE>. It was a
50-50 mixture of two powerful herbicides _ 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T.
   In <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops sprayed Agent Orange from the air to
strip away the enemy's jungle cover and deplete its crops. It worked
devastatingly well.
   The herbicide was banned after the chemical dioxin, which is
present in 2,4,5-T, was found to be the most carcinogenic substance
ever tested on laboratory animals.
   Veterans organizations have pointed to evidence that the
herbicide may cause serious disorders, including non-Hodgkins
lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma and a liver ailment known as <ORGANIZATION>PCT</ORGANIZATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION>, on the other hand, has maintained that Agent Orange has
been scientifically linked to only one illness in humans, a severe
skin rash called chloracne. And the government has insisted that
veterans seeking benefits because of chloracne provide proof that
they got the rash from <ORGANIZATION>Agent Orange</ORGANIZATION>, a burden that has been
impossible for most to meet.
   However, in what some veterans see as a partial admission of
responsibility, the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> has provided free medical care to anyone who
believes he or she became ill because of Agent Orange.
   Under <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON>'s new orders, the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Veterans Affairs</ORGANIZATION>
has begun redrafting its guidelines for disability benefits,
starting by changing the way in which it determines whether a
``significant statistical association'' exists between Agent Orange
and a disease.
   A scientific advisory committee planned to review the proposed
changes at a meeting today with changes to be published in the
<ORGANIZATION>Federal Register</ORGANIZATION>. Derwinski will make a final decision on the
changes, probably in <DATE>October</DATE>.
   Once new guidelines are in place, the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION>'s advisory committee
will reconsider whether links exist between Agent Orange and
diseases that veterans believe it has caused. Again, a final
decision will be up to <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON>.
   The stakes are high, as the makers of Agent Orange can attest.
After veterans filed a lawsuit against them, seven chemical
companies settled out of court for <MONEY>$180 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1984</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> has said cost is irrelevant to the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION>'s stance.
Disability benefits, which are independent of medical benefits or
Social Security, currently range from <MONEY>$73</MONEY> a month for a veteran who
is <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> disabled to <MONEY>$1,468</MONEY> a month for a veteran who is 100
percent disabled.
   If just 30,000 veterans were found to be <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> disabled, the
cost to the government would be more than <MONEY>$26 million</MONEY> a year.
   For that reason alone, some veterans' advocates say they doubt
the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> will adopt sweeping changes.
   ``The VA would literally be opening the doors to tens of
thousands of claims,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Sparrow</ORGANIZATION>. ``I just don't see how they
could do it.''
   <PERSON>Fred Juarbe</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Veterans Service</ORGANIZATION> program
for the <ORGANIZATION>Veterans of Foreign Wars</ORGANIZATION>, commended <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> for taking ``a
step in the right direction.''
   Still, <PERSON>Juarbe</PERSON> said, ``I think the bottom line is, we're still
going to require legislation. ... Given the way the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> has ruled in
the past, we're not confident that we can rely on the <ORGANIZATION>Department of
Veterans Affairs</ORGANIZATION> to carry out this policy.''
   One such piece of legislation was introduced in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> earlier
this month. A bill by Sens. <PERSON>John Kerry</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Mass.</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Alan Cranston</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>D-Calif.</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Tom Daschle</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-S.D.</LOCATION>, would provide disability benefits
for veterans who have non-Hodgkins lymphoma or soft-tissue sarcoma,
two of the diseases associated with Agent Orange.
   ``It is time to end the bickering over which study shows the most
connection between Agent Orange and certain illnesses and time to
begin helping <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans,'' said <PERSON>Kerry</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>
lieutenant who skippered a patrol boat in the <ORGANIZATION>Mekong Delta</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>George Claxton</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> sergeant who was, along with <PERSON>Maier</PERSON>,
one of the original plaintiffs in the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> lawsuit against
the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION>, said he is optimistic about prospects for change.
   ``I just want the satisfaction of seeing that people are treated
with justice and compassion,'' said <PERSON>Claxton</PERSON>, 46, of <LOCATION>Lansing</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>,
who believes his exposure to Agent Orange caused bleeding colitis
and a nervous disorder.
   However, he added: ``Personally, I don't ever expect to be paid
back for what <ORGANIZATION>Agent Orange</ORGANIZATION> did to me. You pay a heavy price for
war.''

<TEXT>
   Government scientists, who a week ago
announced that a study found no link between Agent Orange exposure
and a rare form of cancer among <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans, say the herbicide
cannot be ruled out, either.
   The chief investigator for the <ORGANIZATION>Selected Cancers Study</ORGANIZATION> said
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that the findings don't eliminate an Agent Orange
connection.
   ``The study does not rule out that Agent Orange may cause
cancer,'' <PERSON>Dr. Edward Brann</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> told the <ORGANIZATION>House Veterans Affairs Committee</ORGANIZATION>.
   Asked about this afterward, <PERSON>Brann</PERSON> added: ``Agent Orange may
cause cancer. We don't know from this study.''
   In a summary of the study released <DATE>last week</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> said: ``We
found no evidence that the increased risk of NHL (non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma) might be related to exposure to Agent Orange in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>.''
   The summary noted the study's determination that sailors with
the least exposure to Agent Orange were more prone than ground
troops to get the disease, and that veterans from the region that
included the area of highest use of the herbicide had a lower risk.
   ``These data, along with evidence from other studies regarding
the likelihood of <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans' exposure to Agent Orange, make
it quite unlikely that the increased risk of <ORGANIZATION>NHL</ORGANIZATION> among <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>
veterans results from exposure to herbicides,'' it added.
   Brann and <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON>William L. Roper</PERSON> told lawmakers that the
study must be seen in the light of other scientific research.
   Still, members of the panel questioned the reliability of the
study in the 12-year-old debate over Agent Orange. Brann himself
said he did not approve of one major question veterans were asked
to determine whether they had been exposed to the herbicide, which
was sprayed on jungle areas in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> to deny cover to the enemy.
   Veterans were asked if they had been in defoliated areas.
   Interpretations of the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> study by scientists, veterans
organizations and the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Veterans Affairs</ORGANIZATION> have varied
widely because the new report looked only obliquely at Agent Orange
exposure.
   The original intent of the study was to look at Agent Orange and
its relationship to various cancers on the assumption that <PERCENT>25
percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans were exposed to the herbicide.
   <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> later changed course, however, deciding that the ``results
of several studies'' make the premise of <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> exposure
``unlikely.''
   The study found a <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> higher risk of non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma in all <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans compared with the overall male
population, but no significantly higher risk for five other
cancers. The <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>last week</DATE> decided to award disability payments to
those veterans as a result.
   Agent Orange were sprayed in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> from <DATE>1965</DATE> to <DATE>1970</DATE>,
according to the <LOCATION>VA</LOCATION>. The herbicide has two active phenoxy
ingredients, but the prime suspect is another ingredient, dioxin,
with which it was contaminated.
   Dioxin is known to cause cancer in laboratory animals.
   More than 36,000 of the nation's 2.6 million <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans
have requested benefits based on claims they suffered diseases
attributable to Agent Orange. Only three of those veterans have
been granted disability payments _ for a skin condition known as
chloracne.
   <PERSON>Roper</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION>'s ``Ranch Hand'' study of the people
who flew the Agent Orange spraying operations and handled the
barrels of the herbicide puts the new study in the right
perspective.
   He said the men in that study were known to have been exposed to
dioxin, yet have not developed cancers.
   But Rep. <PERSON>Douglas Applegate</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Ohio</LOCATION>, said that study ignored the
ground troops who ``ate, breathed, drank and sometimes slept in
Agent Orange.''

<HEAD>Secretary Derwinski Delays Agent Orange Decision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Veterans' Affairs Secretary <PERSON>Edward Derwinski</PERSON>
says he won't decide before <DATE>March</DATE> whether to grant disability
payments to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans exposed to Agent Orange.
   <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> said <DATE>Friday</DATE> he won't make his decision until the
<ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> releases the results of a
study begun in <DATE>1985</DATE>. The study is expected in <DATE>March</DATE>.
   After a <DATE>Nov. 3</DATE> advisory committee meeting, <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> had
promised a decision in a few weeks.
   <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> epidemiologists in <DATE>1985</DATE> launched a major study of the health
records of thousands of veterans to see if they were at increased
risk of five types of cancer: lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, and
nasal, nasopharyngeal and liver cancer.
   The advisory committee said after reviewing more than 30 studies
that it could not find a statistically significant relationship
between a rare cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and exposure to the
chemicals used in the defoliant Agent Orange.
   In <DATE>May</DATE>, a federal judge in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> ruled that the
department had been too strict in denying disability benefits on
the grounds there was no proof that those chemicals caused the
illnesses cited by some 34,000 veterans.
   Instead, the judge said the department need only find
statistically significant associations between exposure and
illness. Derwinski decided not to appeal the decision.
   <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> said in a statement <DATE>Friday</DATE> that several committee
members had said the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> study could weigh heavily in their
recommendations.
   ``I am as determined now to resolve this issue as I was when I
decided not to appeal the court decision, but it is logical to wait
for a few extra months for the results of the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> cancer study,''
he said.
   Agent Orange, used in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> to strip vegetation cover used by
guerrillas, has been blamed by veterans' groups for many disorders,
particularly cancer, because it was contaminated with dioxins, a
byproduct of its manufacture.
   Some of the 75 dioxin compounds are among the most powerful
causes of cancer ever tested in laboratory animals, but it has
never been proven they can cause cancer in humans.
   Exposure to dioxin in high concentrations is known to cause
chloracne, a skin disorder, and recent work has led some scientists
to suspect dioxin may also cause birth defects.
   In <DATE>1986</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> required the Veterans Administration to give
hospital care to any veteran exposed to Agent Orange in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>
unless the VA found some other cause for his disability.

In a significant shift in federal policy, <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans suffering from a 
rare form of cancer that they claim was caused by exposure to the defoliant 
Agent Orange will receive full disability benefits, Veterans Affairs officials 
announced <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the <ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION> found in a study released 
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> that <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans are <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> more likely than non-veterans to 
contract non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, even though they specifically denied a link 
between Agent Orange exposure and incidence of the cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Acting immediately after receipt of the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> study, Secretary of Veterans 
Affairs <PERSON>Edward J. Derwinski</PERSON> ordered full benefits paid to some 1,800 veterans 
who currently suffer from the disease and to the expected 450 new cases 
expected each year for the next several decades. 
</P>
<P>
Derwinski's decision marks the first time that the federal government has 
acknowledged a link between service in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and incidence of any form of 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Veterans groups applauded the decision, but said that tens of thousands of 
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans still await government help in coping with several cancers and 
other health problems they believe were caused by Agent Orange exposure. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> study and the shift in <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> policy will not end the long, bitter dispute 
over Agent Orange and cancer, veterans' advocates and government officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
While the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> study found a clear link between service in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and 
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON>Dr. William L. Roper</PERSON> stated: "The study 
did not find any evidence that the increased risk might be due to Agent Orange 
exposure." 
</P>
<P>
In an unexpected and unexplained finding, <PERSON>Roper</PERSON> noted that sailors who served 
on ships far off the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> coast suffered the highest incidence of 
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, also known as <ORGANIZATION>NHL</ORGANIZATION>. Soldiers and airmen who served in 
<LOCATION>III Corps</LOCATION>, the area of the heaviest spraying of the chemical herbicide, were at 
lower risk of contracting the disease, the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> found. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> said the link between service in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and the cancer was 
compelling enough to demand action, but the VA chief offered no opinion as to 
whether Agent Orange played a part in generating the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"The debate may well go on forever," <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> said in a press conference. 
"There may never be enough scientific and technical evidence to put to rest 
forever all the charges and countercharges relating to Agent Orange." 
</P>
<P>
He called <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s action "a practical and humanitarian decision." He 
stressed it was "not a scientific decision, and it should not be seen as one. 
It was a policy determination. . . . Remember, this is a kinder, gentler 
Administration." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 36,000 <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans have applied for <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> benefits on claims that they 
contracted cancer or other maladies as a result of exposure to Agent Orange, a 
defoliant containing dioxin, a highly toxic agent that was widely sprayed in 
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> from <DATE>1961</DATE> to <DATE>1972</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
All of the <ORGANIZATION>Agent Orange</ORGANIZATION> cancer claims have until now been denied, although 
21,000 of the Agent Orange claimants are receiving medical care from the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION>, 
agency officials said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Mary R. Trout</PERSON>, national president of the <ORGANIZATION>Vietnam Veterans of America</ORGANIZATION> and one of 
the most vocal critics of federal policy on Agent Orange, called <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON>'s 
decision "very positive." 
</P>
<P>
But she quickly added: "We still have some concerns. If it takes a <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> increase 
(in the incidence of a cancer) to win benefits, then it's going to take a very 
long time for other veterans" to be compensated for Vietnam-related health 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Miles <PERSON>S. Epling</PERSON>, national commander of the <ORGANIZATION>American Legion</ORGANIZATION>, praised <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> 
for "taking one small step toward resolution of this problem we've been 
fighting for over 10 years." He said he hoped <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> would now speed 
consideration of claims based on 10 other maladies that veterans say are 
related to Agent Orange. 
</P>
<P>
But Epling blasted the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> study as "irrelevant." 
</P>
<P>
"It has nothing to do with Agent Orange, and it says so. It's a piece of 
garbage as far as we're concerned," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> study looked at cases of six types of cancer among <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans and 
other men between the ages of 35 and 59. The study found that the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> 
veterans were at no greater risk than the non-veterans of contracting five of 
the cancers: soft-tissue and other sarcomas, <ORGANIZATION>Hodgkin</ORGANIZATION>'s disease, nasal cancer, 
nasopharyngeal cancer and cancer originating in the liver. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> will continue to deny benefits to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans with these cancers 
who claim they are service-connected, but <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> left open the possibility 
that future research could support payment of such claims. 
</P>
<P>
For non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph nodes and lymphatic tissues 
that is similar to leukemia, <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans were <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> more likely to come down 
with the disease than those in the same age group who did not serve in 
<LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
NHL has a latency period of 15 to 25 years and if left untreated is virtually 
always fatal. Chemotherapy has prolonged the life of a number of <ORGANIZATION>NHL</ORGANIZATION> patients 
but has not reversed the degenerative disease. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> said that for VA purposes, any <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veteran with <ORGANIZATION>NHL</ORGANIZATION> will be 
considered <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> disabled and will be paid full benefits -- today worth about 
<MONEY>$1,527</MONEY> a month -- for the rest of his life. Widows and children of <ORGANIZATION>NHL</ORGANIZATION> victims 
will also be entitled to maximum compensation, <MONEY>$500</MONEY>-<MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> a month depending on 
the veteran's rank at retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans who claim Agent Orange-related health problems 
are eligible for compensation from a <MONEY>$180-million</MONEY> fund established by seven 
chemical companies that produced the defoliant. The firms agreed to provide the 
money as the result of a class-action lawsuit by veterans. 
</P>
<P>
So far, 17,000 servicemen have been declared eligible for compensation from the 
fund and have received a total of <MONEY>$84 million</MONEY>, according to attorneys handling 
the fund.

<HEAD>A Decade Later, Still No Agreement on Results</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The jury remains out on Agent Orange even
though a decade has passed since <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> told government scientists
to determine whether a link exists between the herbicide and
ailments among <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans.
   Hearings last week on Capitol Hill showed that while veterans
demand compensation for ills _ including cancer, birth defects, and
miscarriages _ they maintain are linked to exposure to the
dioxin-containing substance, scientists are disputing how to go
about a study.
   There were charges of political concerns eclipsing scientific
ones, and pleas for science to yield to human concerns. Critics of
the <ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION>, where most research is done, say
results and action are long overdue.
   ``It's just terribly frustrating,'' said <PERSON>Paul S. Egan</PERSON>,
legislative director of the <ORGANIZATION>Vietnam Veterans of America</ORGANIZATION>. He said
veterans were literally ``drenched'' with Agent Orange and nothing
has happened, yet ``we're alarmed if there seems to be dioxin in
coffee filters.''
   Action is possible in the next year or two, due in part to a
decision by <PERSON>Edward J. Derwinski</PERSON>, secretary of the new <ORGANIZATION>Veterans
Affairs Department</ORGANIZATION>.
   The former congressman was put on the spot when <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District
<PERSON>Judge Thelton E. Henderson</PERSON> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> ordered the VA
department to revise how it determines the possible health effects
of exposure to Agent Orange.
   <PERSON>Henderson</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> had imposed an ``impermissibly demanding
test'' for connecting Agent Orange with health problems.
   Derwinski decided against an appeal, meaning there will be new
rules in <DATE>October</DATE>.
   The new rules would affect the claims by nearly 35,000 veterans
who say they have disorders caused by Agent Orange. Only five claims
have been allowed, and those were all for a skin ailment known as
chloracne.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> may pass legislation that would provide interim
temporary payment of <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> benefits to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans suffering from
non-Hodgkins lymphoma and soft tissue carcinoma, both cancers linked
to Agent Orange.
   Already, because of legislation passed in <DATE>1981</DATE>, lower-income
veterans ``who believe'' their health problems are caused by Agent
Orange may receive VA care, the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> says.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> had passed an interim payment measure <DATE>last fall</DATE>, but
it was opposed by the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration and died in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee</ORGANIZATION> approved a new bill last week.
   The sponsors, Sens. <PERSON>John F. Kerry</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Mass.</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Thomas Daschle</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>D-S.D.</LOCATION>, take <ORGANIZATION>Derwinksi</ORGANIZATION>'s decision on the appeal as a good sign.
   On the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> side, the outlook is questionable. <PERSON>Tim Sechrist</PERSON>, an
aide to Rep. <PERSON>Douglas Applegate</PERSON>, says <PERSON>Applegate</PERSON> wants to look at the
<ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION>'s new regulations. The <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> Democrat is chairman of the Veterans'
Affairs subcommittee on compensation pension and insurance.
   <ORGANIZATION>VA Committee</ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON>G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>
told his hospitals and health care subcommittee <DATE>Monday</DATE>: ``I am
concerned that too many times the emotion surrounding this topic is
the result of apparent mismatches between hoped-for results and the
actual scientific results of studies of Agent Orange. ...
   ``In the other body, there is legislation pending that deals with
compensation for certain diseases on the basis of feared exposure to
Agent Orange. We should not act until exposure is known and the link
between exposure and disease is assessed. We know we cannot simply
rely on service in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> as an indicator of exposure.''
   Those were the issues government scientists were supposed to
start addressing 10 years ago. Hearings <DATE>Monday</DATE> and <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> showed
what has happened.
   <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> scientist <PERSON>Dr. Vernon N. Houk</PERSON> said a study is impossible
because its results can't be validated. The result was cancellation
in <DATE>1986</DATE> of a massive epidemiological study undertaken in <DATE>1983</DATE>, with
<MONEY>$19 million</MONEY> of its cost unspent.
   VA was given some <MONEY>$3 million</MONEY> of that last year to conduct blood
tests on <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> veterans of Ranch Hand, the Agent Orange spraying
operation in which 1,200 people participated. The <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION>, in an
ongoing study criticized by outsiders, says so far the death rate
among <ORGANIZATION>Ranch Handers</ORGANIZATION> is no different from that of the general
population and there is no proof of a link to cancer.
   <PERSON>Houk</PERSON> said there was no way to prove where a soldier was when 12
million gallons of Agent Orange were sprayed over <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> between
<DATE>1965</DATE> and <DATE>1970</DATE> to destroy the dense foliage that provided cover to
the enemy.
   Witnesses, including former government scientists, challenged the
<ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> in a hearing <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> of an oversight subcommittee of the
<ORGANIZATION>Government Operations Committee</ORGANIZATION>. They said <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> ignored detailed
records of spraying and troop movements available in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and
elsewhere, and tried to water down both the Agent Orange study and a
separate <ORGANIZATION>Vietnam Experience Study</ORGANIZATION>.
   Government scientists, in turn, criticized a study done by
<ORGANIZATION>Columbia University</ORGANIZATION> scientists <PERSON>Jeanne</PERSON> and <PERSON>Steven Stellman</PERSON> for the
<ORGANIZATION>American Legion</ORGANIZATION>.
   The study, matching a mail survey of 6,810 veterans with
government records on troop movements and herbicide spraying, found
a correlation between Agent Orange and various health complaints
reported by the veterans. There were no results on cancer.
   <ORGANIZATION>Congress' Office of Technology Assessment</ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION>American
Legion</ORGANIZATION> self-reporting study suffered from inaccurate recollections
by veterans 20 years after service, imprecise depiction of
locations, and spray paths that are too wide to be useful.
   Governments officials say more will be known next <DATE>spring</DATE> when <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION>
releases a study of the incidence of selected cancers in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>
veterans. They also say scientists are better able to test blood for
dioxin and they have a better idea how long dioxin remains in the
body.
   Whatever those results, one scientist says an open mind is the
answer. ``As long as there are millions of veterans and family
members who have a legitimate health concern regarding this issue,
it is incumbent upon us to consider any and all possibilities, and
certainly to consider new technology and lateral approaches in this
area,'' said <PERSON>Dr. Michael E. Kafrissen</PERSON>, former visiting scientist at
<ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION>.

   The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> approved legislation <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that
would give Vietnam-era veterans disability benefits for certain
illnesses associated with <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> use of Agent Orange.
   The bill provides payments on an interim basis, through <DATE>April
15, 1992</DATE>, while providing for subsequent congressional votes to
make the benefits permanent. Benefits would be paid to veterans
with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and soft-tissue sarcoma.
   A broader version is pending in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>.
   Passage of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> bill by voice vote was a victory for
veterans advocates, who have been battling government scientists.
They have accused various agencies of ignoring evidence about the
deadly herbicide while government scientists have said that no
clear cause-and-effect relationship has been established.
   ``It has been a long, hard struggle,'' said <PERSON>Sen. Alan Cranston</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>D-Calif.</LOCATION>, a co-sponsor of the bill and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Veterans
Affairs Committee</ORGANIZATION>. ``Too many <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans and their families
have suffered anguish for far too long.''
   ``This bill is important ... obviously because it creates a
presumption in favor of veterans,'' said <PERSON>Sen. John Kerry</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Mass.</LOCATION>,
a <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veteran. He said the measure makes it clear that ``there
will not be an adversariness in the attempt by veterans to seek the
services that they are entitled to. ... It does not open up a
<ORGANIZATION>Pandora</ORGANIZATION>'s box of benefits because these are two very rare
diseases.''
   The bill was discussed on the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> floor <DATE>late Wednesday</DATE> and
passed with little difficulty <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>.
   An estimated 2.6 million military personnel were in <LOCATION>South
Vietnam</LOCATION> during the war in the late <DATE>1960s</DATE> and early <DATE>1970s</DATE>. Some
250,000 have told the <ORGANIZATION>Veterans Administration</ORGANIZATION>, now the <ORGANIZATION>Department
of Veterans Affairs</ORGANIZATION>, that they believe they were exposed, and
35,000 have applied for disability benefits.
   Veterans already are allowed to receive outpatient and hospital
care for illnesses presumed to be linked to Agent Orange.
   Approximately 12 million gallons of the herbicide were sprayed
during the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War to remove the foliage providing ground cover
for the enemy. Agent Orange contains dioxin, one of the most toxic
chemicals known, as well as 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D, also harmful
chemicals.
   The bill in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> would allow veterans to be compensated
longer, and for more diseases. Under it, veterans with
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, melanoma and basal
cell carcinoma would be eligible for permanent disability benefits.
So would their survivors.
   The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> bill has been estimated to cost <MONEY>$40 million</MONEY>. No such
estimate was available for the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> version, although it would be
considerably less.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> bill establishes _ for the first time _ a presumption
of service connection for any <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veteran with chloracne, a
skin condition, provided it occurred within a year of the time the
person's service tour ended.
   Both bills require extensive record-keeping by the <ORGANIZATION>Veterans
Administration</ORGANIZATION> based on health reports and tissue samples from
veterans. Both would ask the <ORGANIZATION>National Academy of Sciences</ORGANIZATION> to review
scientific studies on Agent Orange exposure every two years, with
the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Veterans Affairs</ORGANIZATION> making its benefits
determinations based on those reviews.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> passed an Agent Orange bill last year but the measure
never emerged from the <ORGANIZATION>House Veterans' Affairs Committee</ORGANIZATION>.
   Rep. <PERSON>G.V.</PERSON> ``Sonny'' <PERSON>Montgomery</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Miss.</LOCATION>, chairman of that
committee, and the senior minority member, Rep. <PERSON>Bob Stump</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Ariz.</LOCATION>,
sent colleagues a letter last month calling the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> bill
``premature at best.''
   They cited a continuing study by the <ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION>
on the incidence of selected cancers among Vietnam-era veterans,
due for completion next <DATE>spring</DATE>, and noted a federal court order to
change the criteria used to evaluate Agent Orange studies and the
recent creation of a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Court of Veterans Appeals</ORGANIZATION> to review
claims.
   But supporters of the bill said the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> had moved too
slowly to determine whether a link exists between Agent Orange and
the various afflictions.
   During a <ORGANIZATION>House Government Operations</ORGANIZATION> subcommittee hearing in
early <DATE>July</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> was accused of rigging its Agent Orange study
to show no direct link. Officials of the health agency maintained
that it dropped a massive study of Agent Orange exposure because
there was no way to tell who was exposed.

<HEAD>Panels Challenge VA Authority To Award Back Payments to Vets With
Cancer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two congressional committees are challenging a
<ORGANIZATION>Veterans Affairs Department</ORGANIZATION> decision to award back payment of
previously denied claims to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> vets suffering from a rare form
of cancer linked to Agent Orange.
   The Democratic and Republican leaders of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>
veterans committees wrote a letter to the <DATE>VA earlier this month</DATE>
challenging the authority of the department to award retroactive
benefits.
   But the legal issue is caught up in the emotional and complex
issue of compensating veterans who claim they have a variety of
ailments due to exposure to the defoliant Agent Orange.
   The letter, which was first disclosed in <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s editions of
The Washington Post, said benefits may be awarded only
``prospectively'' _ from the date of the new regulation _ and not
retroactively.
   It said the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION>'s decision to set a retroactive effective date
for awarding benefits was unprecedented.
   ``We question whether you have such authority under current law
with respect to a claim after its denial has become final,'' the
<DATE>April 18</DATE> letter to <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Edward J. Derwinski</PERSON> said.
   The issue arose <DATE>March 29</DATE>, when the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> announced it would award
benefits to anyone who served in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and later developed
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The announcement came the same day the
federal <ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> said <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> vets
had a <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> higher risk of developing the disease than did men
who hadn't served.
   But the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION>, in its attempt to defuse the lingering Agent Orange
issue, used its file of past <ORGANIZATION>Agent Orange</ORGANIZATION> claims to come up with
the number of lymphoma victims who should be compensated.
   The government consistently denies a connection between exposure
to the defoliant and a host of ailments, despite claims of veterans
groups, a class-action lawsuit that was settled, and a number of
independent scientists.
   Derwinski asserted that the benefits were for not for Agent
Orange exposure but for anyone who served in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> who has the
cancer. VA was thus able to give some relief without conceding an
association between exposure and disease.
   The same <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> study ruled out an increase in several other
cancers among <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans that have been linked to Agent
Orange exposure. The <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> has acknowledged that the study does not
disprove a connection.
   The <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> estimated it would have to pay up to <MONEY>$25 million</MONEY> a year
in death and disability benefits to the 1,800 afflicted veterans or
their survivors. It is drafting new regulations to award the claims.
   Should the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> reverse its <DATE>March 29</DATE> decision, those who were
previously denied claims could refile for benefits. The benefits
would become payable from the date of the new regulations or the
date of the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> study, said <PERSON>Charles Peckarsky</PERSON>, an adviser to the
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> committee.
   The letter, which originated in the <ORGANIZATION>House VA Committee</ORGANIZATION>, is
signed by Rep. <PERSON>G.V.</PERSON> ``Sonny'' <PERSON>Montgomery</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> Democrat
who chairs the committee; Rep. <PERSON>Bob Stump</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Ariz.</LOCATION>, the ranking
minority member; <PERSON>Sen. Alan Cranston</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Calif.</LOCATION>, chairman of the
<ORGANIZATION>Senate VA Committee</ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON>Sen. Frank H. Murkowski</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Alaska</LOCATION>, the
ranking Republican member.
   VA spokesman <PERSON>Dennis R. Boxx</PERSON> defended <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON>'s action, saying,
``He believes that the decision was a legal decision, but just as
importantly, a fair and humane decision that was appropriate given
all the complex questions and issues.''
   He said the development is ironic because the VA ``is often
accused of not trying to do things that are humane and fair and
compassionate.''
   The committee leaders' views are not necessarily shared by all
the members.
   ``I don't think it behooves veterans advocates to be working
against veterans benefits,'' said Rep. <PERSON>Lane Evans</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Ill.</LOCATION>, a member
of the committee and a leader of the Vietnam-era veterans caucus in
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Judge Strikes Down VA Rules, Orders Vets' Claims Reopened</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge ordered the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government to
reconsider the Agent Orange health claims of more than 31,000
veterans because existing rules ``sharply tipped the scales''
against those exposed to the toxic defoliant.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Thelton Henderson</PERSON> struck down the <ORGANIZATION>Department
of Veterans Affairs</ORGANIZATION>' regulations that denied Agent Orange
service-related benefits for cancers and all other diseases except
one non-fatal skin condition.
   In a ruling on a nationwide lawsuit brought on behalf of Agent
Orange claimants, <PERSON>Henderson</PERSON> said the department was wrong to
require direct proof that the dioxin-containing herbicide caused
various diseases.
   The department, formerly known as the <ORGANIZATION>Veterans Administration</ORGANIZATION>,
should give claimants the benefit of the doubt, he said.
   Veterans' advocates praised the decision, which was made public
<DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   ``This is a major victory with far-reaching implications,'' said
<PERSON>Mary Sout</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Vietnam Veterans of America</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The ruling validates what <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans have been saying
for years, that the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> has failed to give Agent Orange victims a
fair hearing. ... I am optimistic that <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> will now act
quickly to resolve this most painful legacy of the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Vietnam Veterans of America</ORGANIZATION> again will sponsor legislation to
require Agent Orange benefits for two types of cancer _ soft-tissue
sarcoma and non-Hodgkins lymphoma _ and establish a new,
independent scientific panel to study the herbicide's health
effects, said <PERSON>Barry Kasinitz</PERSON>, spokesman for the 35,000-member group.
   A similar bill was passed by the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> last year but died in
the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Kasinitz</PERSON> said.
   The veterans department was represented by the <ORGANIZATION>Justice
Department</ORGANIZATION>. Justice spokeswoman <PERSON>Amy Brown</PERSON> declined to comment on
the ruling, saying department lawyers had not seen it.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> used Agent Orange to defoliate forests in
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. Its health effects are sharply disputed.
   In <DATE>1985</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> ruled that only a non-fatal skin malady,
chloracne, could be considered an effect of exposure to the
herbicide. The agency based its ruling on a review of studies of
Agent Orange's effects by an 11-member scientific committee.
   Henderson rejected an attempt by the veterans' group to
challenge the scientific panel's review. But he said the standards
the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> used in making its rules violated a <DATE>1984</DATE> federal law
designed to help <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans get health benefits.
   The VA improperly required proof of a cause-and-effect
relationship between the herbicide and a disease for which benefits
were sought, the judge said. Instead, the agency should have
required only that statistics show a significant correlation
between dioxin exposure and a disease, or an ``increased risk of
incidence,'' he said.
   The federal law does not spell out the proper standard, but
members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> who helped pass the law indicated they opposed
an overly stringent standard and felt that cause-and-effect proof
was unnecessary, <PERSON>Henderson</PERSON> said. The law's ``remedial purpose''
also favors a lenient standard, he said.
   The judge noted that the VA had relied on statistical
relationships, without requiring proof of causation, in granting
benefits to veterans who were amputees and developed heart disease.
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> did the same thing in granting benefits to former
prisoners of war who suffered various diseases, <PERSON>Henderson</PERSON> said.
   He also said the VA erred by refusing to apply to its Agent
Orange regulations the same ``benefit of the doubt'' policy it used
to review individual benefit cases, which favors the veteran in
close questions.
   ``These errors, especially sharply compounded with one another,
sharply tipped the scales against veteran claimants,'' <PERSON>Henderson</PERSON>
said.
   Henderson's ruling does not require the government to add any
diseases to the service-connected list for Agent Orange. But
<PERSON>Kasinitz</PERSON> said he was encouraged by the performance of Veterans
Affairs Secretary <PERSON>Edward Derwinski</PERSON>.
   ``We think that we probably stand a better chance of getting a
fair review under the current administration than we did under the
past one,'' <PERSON>Kasinitz</PERSON> said.

   A <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans group in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>
said <DATE>Monday</DATE> it has lost patience with federal government efforts to
study the effects of <ORGANIZATION>Agent Orange</ORGANIZATION> and will conduct its own survey
on exposure to the toxic defoliant.
   ``This state - the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans of <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> - have said
enough is enough,'' said <PERSON>David Kaufman</PERSON>, a veteran from <LOCATION>Fort
Lauderdale</LOCATION>. ``We're going to take the bull by the horns.''
   <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, with about 527,000 <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans, is the first state
to attempt such a project, according to <PERSON>Kaufman</PERSON>, chairman of the
<ORGANIZATION>Agent Orange Committee</ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION>Vietnam Veterans of Florida</LOCATION>.
   The survey has the backing of national <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans groups
and individual scientists at the <ORGANIZATION>Department for Veterans Affairs</ORGANIZATION>,
the <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease
Control</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Kaufman</PERSON> said.
   ``There are scientists and epidemiolgists who work for the VA
and the <ORGANIZATION>EPA</ORGANIZATION> who are outraged at this latest <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> fiasco,'' <PERSON>Kaufman</PERSON>
told reporters.
   A congressional study released last month charged that the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION>
misspent <MONEY>$6.6 million</MONEY> while conducting a disputed study of the
effects of Agent Orange.
   An estimated 12 million gallons of Agent Orange, composed
primarily of cancer-causing dioxin, was sprayed over <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> by
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops between <DATE>1965</DATE> and <DATE>1970</DATE> to destroy the jungle that hid
the enemy.
   Veterans groups say exposure to Agent Orange has been linked to
19 types of cancer and other health problems, including birth
defects. Earlier this year, the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> decided to award compensation to
veterans with two rare cancers, soft-tissue sarcoma and
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, linked to Agent Orange.
   Since <DATE>1981</DATE>, some lower-income veterans who believe their health
problems are caused by Agent Orange have received VA care, the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION>
said.
   But the veterans are a long way from getting the government to
acknowledge that Agent Orange has caused lingering diseases in
veterans and birth defects in their children, veterans groups say.
   The <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> has said that military records did not identify veterans
who had been exposed to the chemical.
   ``We're going to provide them with information,'' <PERSON>Kaufman</PERSON> said.
   He said there are 116 scientists from the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>EPA</ORGANIZATION> ``who
have pledged that if we get them the surveys they will go through
them.'' Those scientists, whom <PERSON>Kaufman</PERSON> would not name, also helped
write the 116-question survey, he said.
   The organization has printed only 1,000 surveys thus far. It
wants to get 500,000 distributed and returned within six months.
<PERSON>Kaufman</PERSON> said it will cost about <MONEY>$3 million</MONEY> to conduct the survey,
and that veterans would have to raise money as they go to pay for
the project.
   About 200 surveys were handed out <DATE>Monday</DATE> to veterans gathered
for Veterans Day ceremonies at the group's <LOCATION>Tallahassee</LOCATION>
headquarters, <PERSON>Kaufman</PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Elmo Zumwalt, Son of Admiral, Dies At Age 42</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elmo <PERSON>R. Zumwalt III</PERSON>, son of the
admiral who ordered the spraying of Agent Orange in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and who
was exposed to the defoliant himself, died at his home <DATE>Saturday</DATE>
from cancer. He was 42.
   Zumwalt, a lawyer, said he never blamed his father for his
disease. The two co-wrote a book titled ``My Father, My Son,''
which was made into a television movie.
   Zumwalt was diagnosed in <DATE>January 1983</DATE> as having stage 4
non-Hodgkins lymphoma. In <DATE>February 1985</DATE>, during his ninth biopsy,
doctors discovered he had stage 3 <PERSON>Hodgkins</PERSON> disease, another form of
lymphoma.
   Agent Orange contains highly toxic dioxin. Veterans had
contended that exposure to it causes cancer and other illnesses.
They said it caused miscarriages by wives of servicemen and birth
defects in their children.
   Zumwalt's son, <PERSON>Elmo Russell Zumwalt IV</PERSON>, suffers from a
congenital dysfunction that confuses his physical senses.
   In an article published in the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post on <DATE>Oct. 7, 1984</DATE>,
<PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON> said: ``My father, Adm. <PERSON>Elmo Zumwalt Jr.</PERSON>, was a strong
advocate of the use of Agent Orange in the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War. That
doesn't mean that I hold him responsible for any disease I may have
incurred. He did what he felt he had to do to reduce casualties. I
did what I felt I had to do. I volunteered for service in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>
because I felt whatever the risks, that was where I belonged. Even
now at the age of 38 I'm confronted by undoubted perils. I am not
sorry I went.''
   On <DATE>June 30</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> removed the last legal
obstacle to a <MONEY>$180 million</MONEY> settlement between <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans and
the manufacturers of Agent Orange. The justices let stand rulings
that dismissed lawsuits by about 300 veterans who had challenged
the <DATE>1984</DATE> settlement.
   The <MONEY>$180 million</MONEY> settlement now totals about <MONEY>$240 million</MONEY> with
interest. As many as 250,000 people could receive money from the
settlement.
   The elder <PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON> said he ordered Agent Orange sprayed over the
<ORGANIZATION>Mekong Delta</ORGANIZATION> to kill vegetation and drive ``the <ORGANIZATION>Viet Cong</ORGANIZATION> back
1,000 yards off the water's edge.''
   He commanded <ORGANIZATION>Naval</ORGANIZATION> forces in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> from 1968-1970, then served
as chief of <ORGANIZATION>Naval</ORGANIZATION> operations until <DATE>1974</DATE> when he retired from active
duty. His son served in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> from <DATE>June 1969</DATE> to <DATE>August 1970</DATE> as a
lieutenant junior grade commanding a patrol boat.
   ``I do not have any guilt feelings because I was convinced then
and I am convinced now that the use of Agent Orange saved literally
hundreds and maybe thousands of lives,'' the elder <PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>The
Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1985</DATE>.
   In addition to his son, <PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON> is survived by his wife,
<PERSON>Katherine</PERSON>; and his daughter, <PERSON>Maya</PERSON>, 13.

A federal judge has thrown out the <ORGANIZATION>Veterans Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s rules on health 
damage attributed to the herbicide Agent Orange and has ordered the VA to 
reconsider the claims of more than 31,000 <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans. 
</P>
<P>
In denying most claims for health benefits related to Agent Orange, the VA 
wrongly required proof that the herbicide causes various diseases, <PERSON>U. S. 
District Judge Thelton Henderson</PERSON> said in a decision made public <DATE>Monday</DATE>. 
Statistical evidence showing a significant correlation between Agent Orange and 
the diseases would be sufficient, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
"These errors, especially sharply compounded with one another, sharply tipped 
the scales against veteran claimants," <PERSON>Henderson</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
In a nationwide suit on behalf of Agent Orange claimants, <PERSON>Henderson</PERSON> struck down 
VA regulations that deny Agent Orange service-connected health benefits for 
cancers and all other diseases except one non-fatal skin condition, chloracne. 
He also ordered the VA to reopen all claims denied under those rules. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a major victory with far-reaching implications," <PERSON>Mary Stout</PERSON>, president 
of <ORGANIZATION>Vietnam Veterans of America</ORGANIZATION>, said. 
</P>
<P>
"The ruling validates what <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans have been saying for years, that 
the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> has failed to give Agent Orange victims a fair hearing. . . . I am 
optimistic that <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> will now act quickly to resolve this most painful 
legacy of the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Barry Kasinitz</PERSON>, spokesman for the 35,000-member group, said it will again 
sponsor legislation to require Agent Orange benefits for two types of cancer -- 
soft-tissue sarcoma and non-Hodgkins lymphoma -- and establish a new scientific 
panel, independent of the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION>, to study the herbicide's health effects. A 
similar bill was passed by the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> last year but died in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although <PERSON>Henderson</PERSON>'s ruling does not require the government to add any diseases 
to the service-connected list for Agent Orange, <PERSON>Kasinitz</PERSON> said the performance 
so far of the secretary of the new <ORGANIZATION>Cabinet-level Department of Veterans 
Affairs</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Edward Derwinski</PERSON>, provides some grounds for optimism. 
</P>
<P>
"We think that we probably stand a better chance of getting a fair review under 
the current <ORGANIZATION>Administration</ORGANIZATION> than we did under the past one," <PERSON>Kasinitz</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The VA was represented by the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION>, whose spokeswoman, <PERSON>Amy Brown</PERSON>, 
declined comment on the ruling, saying department lawyers had not seen it. 
</P>
<P>
Agent Orange, whose toxic ingredient is dioxin, was used as a defoliant by the 
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. Its health effects are sharply disputed. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION>, relying on a review by an 11-member scientific committee, ruled in <DATE>1985</DATE> 
that only one condition, chloracne, could be considered a service-connected 
effect of exposure to Agent Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson rejected a challenge by the veterans' group to the scientific 
committee's review of studies on the effects of Agent Orange. But the judge 
said the standards the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> used in making its rules violated a <DATE>1984</DATE> federal law 
that was supposed to help <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans get the health benefits they were 
due. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Henderson</PERSON> said the VA improperly required proof of a cause-and-effect 
relationship between the herbicide and a disease for which benefits would be 
granted. Instead, he said, the agency should have required only that statistics 
show a significant correlation between dioxin exposure and a disease, or an 
"increased risk of incidence." 
</P>
<P>
The federal law does not spell out the proper standard, but comments by members 
of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> involved in passing the law showed that they opposed an overly 
stringent standard and felt that cause-and-effect proof was unnecessary, 
<PERSON>Henderson</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> had relied on statistical relationships, without requiring 
proof of causation, in granting benefits to veterans who were amputees and 
developed heart disease. <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> did the same thing in granting benefits to 
former prisoners of war who suffered various diseases, relying on a VA 
statistical study, <PERSON>Henderson</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also found an error in the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to apply to its Agent Orange 
regulations the same "benefit of the doubt" policy it uses for review of 
individual benefit cases -- a policy that favors the veteran in close 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
Although the language of the law is unclear, the "remedial purpose" of the law 
favors a lenient standard, <PERSON>Henderson</PERSON> said. Noting that veterans would be 
entitled to a favorable standard if they made individual claims, he said 
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> would not have intended to put them in a worse position through a 
collective regulation.

<HEAD>Zumwalt: Son's Death Pushes Him To Fight Harder For Compensation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Adm. <PERSON>Elmo R. Zumalt Jr.</PERSON>, who ordered
the use of Agent Orange in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, says the cancer death of his
son moves him to work harder for compensation for other veterans
affected by the toxic defoliant.
   ``There are still many hundreds of veterans who do need help,''
<PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON> said <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, the day his son died. ``I believe very
strongly now that the evidence is clear that the Agent Orange is
responsible for the problems many veterans are having.''
   Elmo <PERSON>R. Zumwalt III</PERSON>, 42, who was exposed to Agent Orange, died
at his home in <LOCATION>Fayetteville</LOCATION>. He was diagnosed in <DATE>January 1983</DATE> as
having non-Hodgkins lymphoma. Two years later doctors found he had
lymphoma <PERSON>Hodgkins</PERSON> disease.
   Zumwalt's son, <PERSON>Elmo Russell Zumwalt IV</PERSON>, suffers from a
congenital dysfunction that confuses his physical senses.
   Since the war, Adm. <PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON> and his son had pushed for
government assistance to veterans affected by Agent Orange.
   On <DATE>June 30</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> removed the last legal
obstacle to a <MONEY>$180 million</MONEY> settlement between <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans and
the manufacturers of Agent Orange. The justices let stand rulings
that dismissed lawsuits by about 300 veterans who had challenged
the <DATE>1984</DATE> settlement.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said, ``The President and
<PERSON>Mrs. Reagan</PERSON> are deeply saddened and extend their prayers to the
<PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON> family.''
   The younger <PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON> was commanding a boat along the rivers of
the Ca <PERSON>Mau Peninsula</PERSON> when his father, the American naval commander
in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, ordered the spraying of Agent Orange to defoliate the
jungle along the waterways in order to save servicemen by depriving
the enemy of concealment for ambushes.
   Before the spraying, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> forces had a <PERCENT>6 percent</PERCENT> casualty rate
each month. Afterward, that figure dropped to less than <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT>.
   ``I do not second guess the decisions Dad made in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, nor
do I doubt for a minute that the saving of human life was always
his first priority in his conduct of the war,'' the younger <PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON>
once said. ``I have the greatest love and admiration for him as a
man, and the deepest respect for him as a military leader.''
   Young <PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON> once swam through water doused with Agent Orange
to collect weapons from a convoy of <ORGANIZATION>Viet Cong</ORGANIZATION> boats, winning over a
hostile crew that had called him ``the little admiral'' and ``brass
brat'' behind his back.
   The Zumwalts chronicled their battle with cancer in <DATE>1986</DATE> with
the book, ``My Father, My Son,'' which they wrote with author <PERSON>John
Pekkanen</PERSON>. The book was presented in a made-for-television movie in
<DATE>May</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Zumwalt</PERSON> said his son was strong until the end, even joking and
teasing with family members during conversations that began <DATE>Friday</DATE>
<TIME>evening</TIME>.
   ``We had a long conversation, his wife and children and his
brother and me, with him from about 7:30 (<DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>) until about
<TIME>1 o'clock this morning</TIME>,'' the admiral said <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. ``He was
rational and very courageous.''
   Zumwalt was standing by his son's side with other family members
when his son died in his sleep.

cancer two decades after his father ordered use of Agent Orange in

   He won over his crew, but that swim may have marked the

<DATE>Saturday</DATE> at age 42.

<HEAD>Report Says Reagan White House Thwarted Study</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional investigators say a <ORGANIZATION>Reagan White
House</ORGANIZATION> plan to deny federal liability in toxic exposure cases led to
the cancellation of a major study of Agent Orange's effects on
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans.
   A <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> panel concluded in a report issued <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that the
<ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> ``controlled and obstructed'' the study <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>
ordered from the <ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION>.
   The report by the <ORGANIZATION>House Government Operations Committee</ORGANIZATION>
supported arguments by the <ORGANIZATION>American Legion</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> Veterans
of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. They filed a lawsuit last week seeking to have the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION>
resume its study of the health effects of Agent Orange exposure
during the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> war.
   ``While the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration defended the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> conflict
as an honorable war, it worked behind the scenes to deny benefits
to the very people who sacrificed their health for their country,''
said Rep. <PERSON>Ted Weiss</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-N.Y.</LOCATION>, chairman of the subcommittee that
wrote the report.
   The report followed a 14-month investigation and hearings by
<PERSON>Weiss</PERSON>' subcommittee.
   In a written dissent, the subcommittee's ranking Republican said
the report's conclusion of a <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> plot to cover up the truth
about Agent Orange ``is simply not supported by the facts.''
   ``Instead of advancing the debate on Agent Orange in a positive
direction, the human resources subcommittee has abused this issue
in order to launch an ideological assault upon a <ORGANIZATION>Republican White
House</ORGANIZATION> with which it has never agreed,'' Rep. <PERSON>Richard K. Armey</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>R-Texas</LOCATION>, said.
   Agent Orange was a herbicide used to destroy ground cover during
the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> war. It has been blamed by veterans groups for 19
cancers and a variety of other health problems, including birth
defects.
   <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> ordered the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> study to determine whether <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>
veterans had been exposed to Agent Orange. It was to be used as a
basis for other studies measuring links to health problems.
   The report said the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> ordered the study's cancellation
after the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> said it was scientifically impossible to use military
records to identify veterans who had been exposed.
   The committee said the study should have continued ``because <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION>
did not document that exposure could not be assessed'' and
disregarded alternate methods of measuring exposure.
   ``The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> compromised the independence of the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> and
undermined the study by controlling crucial decisions and guiding
the course of research, at the same time it had secretly taken a
legal position to resist demands to compensate victims of Agent
Orange exposure and industrial accidents,'' the report said.
   At the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON>Gayle Lloyd</PERSON> said the agency
would have no comment because it had not seen the report. But she
said, ``We do stand by our studies and our decisions.''
   A spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Veterans Affairs</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Donna St.
John</PERSON>, said the agency had no comment.
   The study was officially monitored by a <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> task force
called the <ORGANIZATION>Agent Orange Working Group</ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> panel concluded
the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> controlled the study through the working group and
the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Management and Budget</ORGANIZATION>.
   The panel said that despite evidence <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans are more
susceptible to certain forms of cancer and birth defects in their
offspring, the federal government has consistently refused to
acknowledge any link to Agent Orange exposure.
   ``The federal government has suppressed or minimized findings of
ill health effects among <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans that could be linked to
Agent Orange exposure,'' the report said.
   But <PERSON>Armey</PERSON> said in his dissent scientific information has failed
to establish any conclusive link between Agent Orange and health
problems. He said that ``compensating veterans for simple exposure
to <ORGANIZATION>Agent Orange</ORGANIZATION> is a political decision, not a scientific one.''
   The VA this year decided to award compensation for two rare
cancers, soft-tissue sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, linked to
Agent Orange.

they claim resulted from Agent Orange exposure -- non-Hodgkins' disease

airmen who sprayed Agent Orange -- known as the <ORGANIZATION>Ranch Hand</ORGANIZATION> group -- with 804
veterans with less exposure to the herbicide and lower levels of dioxin in
their blood.;    The study, conducted at the <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong Laboratory of Brooks

dioxin and cancer of any kind, liver disease, heart disease, kidney disease,
immune system disorders, psychological abnormalities or nervous system
disease.";    But it said increased dioxin corresponded to increases in
diabetes, body fat, non-cancerous growths, cholesterol and white blood cell
counts.;    "These results suggest that dioxin may affect levels of blood
sugar and fat and act as an irritant to the body," it said.;    It cautioned
that the results should not be applied directly to all <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans
because most had less exposure to dioxin than members of the <ORGANIZATION>Ranch Hand</ORGANIZATION> group.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Senators Optimistic About Agent Orange Benefits Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senators advocating disability benefits for
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans suffering from cancer they believe caused by <ORGANIZATION>Agent
Orange</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> they were confident of finally winning
congressional passage after repeated setbacks.
   Sen. <PERSON>John F. Kerry</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Mass.</LOCATION>, said the compromise bill would
provide interim disability benefits to veterans who were exposed to
the chemical defoliant during the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War and now suffer from
either non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or soft-tissue sarcoma.
   Under the bill, disability benefits would extend only through
<DATE>1993</DATE>. Survivors' benefits for spouses would go through <DATE>mid-April
1992</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, which by then would have received a new study by the
<ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION>, would have to vote to continue the
benefits.
   The measure is needed ``not only to help veterans with their
medical difficulties, but it is also important as a statement that
we intend to make good on our promises to help those who fought in
the war,'' said <PERSON>Kerry</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> lieutenant who piloted a patrol
boat in the <ORGANIZATION>Mekong Delta</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Too many veterans remember what it was like to fight the VC
(<ORGANIZATION>Viet Cong</ORGANIZATION>) They didn't have to come back here to fight the VA
(<ORGANIZATION>Veterans Administration</ORGANIZATION>, the name still used for the Veterans
Department),'' the senator said.
   Separate Agent Orange bills sponsored by <PERSON>Kerry</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sen. Thomas
Daschle</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-S.D.</LOCATION>, failed in <DATE>1987</DATE> and again last year. The <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>
administration steadfastly opposed the proposals, saying more
scientific evidence was needed to link the chemical defoliant used
by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION> to the cancers in the light of
several studies that failed to find such a link.
   But <PERSON>Kerry</PERSON> and <PERSON>Daschle</PERSON>, at a news conference introducing the
legislation, said positive signs from both the new administration
and Capitol Hill account for their optimism.
   The senators said they were encouraged by Veterans Affairs
Secretary <PERSON>Ed Derwinski</PERSON> and his decision last month not to appeal a
federal appeals court's decision striking down regulations to
restrict compensation for Agent Orange victims.
   Derwinski also ordered reviews of the cases of all <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>
veterans whose Agent Orange claims were denied. <PERSON>Daschle</PERSON> praised
<PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> as the ``most sympathetic'' head of the <ORGANIZATION>Veterans
Administration</ORGANIZATION> since the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War.
   The bill's prospects improved when <PERSON>Sen. Alan Cranston</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Calif.</LOCATION>,
chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Veterans' Affairs</ORGANIZATION>, backed it late last year
after various changes to narrow its scope.
   The measure would cost an estimated <MONEY>$19 million</MONEY> annually in
benefits, <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> aides said.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge threw out the <ORGANIZATION>Department of
Veterans Affairs</ORGANIZATION>' rules on Agent Orange health benefits, and
ordered the government to reconsider claims by more than 31,000
veterans.
   In a decision made public <DATE>Monday</DATE>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Thelton
Henderson</PERSON> said the agency wrongly required proof that Agent Orange
causes various diseases in denying most claims for benefits related
to the herbicide.
   <PERSON>Henderson</PERSON>, ruling on a nationwide lawsuit brought on behalf of
Agent Orange claimants, said the agency formerly known as the
<ORGANIZATION>Veterans Administration</ORGANIZATION> failed to give veterans the benefit of the
doubt.
   ``These errors, especially sharply compounded with one another,
sharply tipped the scales against veteran claimants,'' <PERSON>Henderson</PERSON>
said.
   Henderson struck down regulations denying Agent Orange
service-connected benefits for cancers and all other diseases
except chloracne, a non-fatal skin condtion. He also ordered the
agency to reopen all claims denied under those rules.
   ``This is a major victory with far-reaching implications,'' <PERSON>Mary
Stout</PERSON>, president of the 35,000-member <ORGANIZATION>Vietnam Veterans of America</ORGANIZATION>,
said in a statement.
   ``The ruling validates what <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans have been saying
for years, that the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> has failed to give Agent Orange victims a
fair hearing,'' she said. ``I am optimistic that <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> will now
act quickly to resolve this most painful legacy of the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>
War.''
   The government is expected to appeal the decision. The VA was
represented by the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION>.
   Justice spokeswoman <PERSON>Amy Brown</PERSON> declined to comment on <ORGANIZATION>Henderson</ORGANIZATION>'s
ruling, saying department lawyers had not yet seen it. She said the
department would review the ruling before deciding its next step.
   Agent Orange, whose toxic ingredient is dioxin, was used as a
defoliant by the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. Its health effects are
sharply disputed.
   The <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION>, relying on a review by an 11-member scientific
committee, ruled in <DATE>1985</DATE> that only chloracne could be considered a
service-connected effect of exposure to Agent Orange.
   Henderson rejected a challenge by the veterans' group to the
scientific committee's review of studies on Agent Orange's effects.
But the judge said the standards the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> used in making its rules
violated a <DATE>1984</DATE> federal law that was supposed to help <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>
veterans get health benefits due them.
   <PERSON>Henderson</PERSON> said the VA improperly required proof of a
cause-and-effect relationship between the herbicide and a disease
for which benefits would be granted. Instead, he said, the agency
should have required only that statistics show a significant
correlation between dioxin exposure and a disease, or an
``increased risk of incidence.''
   The federal law does not spell out the proper standard, but
comments by members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> involved in passing the law showed
they opposed an overly stringent standard and felt cause-and-effect
proof was unnecessary, <PERSON>Henderson</PERSON> said.
   The judge noted that the VA had relied on statistical
relationships, without requiring proof of the cause, in granting
benefits to veterans who were amputees and developed heart disease.
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> did the same thing in granting benefits to former
prisoners of war who suffered various diseases, <PERSON>Henderson</PERSON> said.
   The judge found a second error in the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to apply to
its Agent Orange regulations the same ``benefit-of-the-doubt''
policy it uses for review of individual benefit cases, which favors
the veteran in close questions.
   Although the law's language is unclear, its ``remedial purpose''
favors a lenient standard, <PERSON>Henderson</PERSON> said. Noting that veterans
would be entitled to a favorable standard if they made individual
claims, he said <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> would not have intended to put them in a
worse position through collective regulation.
   Vietnam Veterans of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON>Barry Kasinitz</PERSON> said the
group will again sponsor Agent Orange legislation.
   The measure would require Agent Orange benefits for two kinds of
cancer _ soft-tissue sarcoma and non-Hodgkins lymphoma _ and to
establish a new scientific panel independent of the VA to study the
herbicide's health effects. The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> passed a similar bill <DATE>last
year</DATE>, but it died in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Kasinitz</PERSON> said.

<TEXT>     "Anybody looking at this issue has to conclude that we may be in the same
situation with a whole new generation of veterans in a matter of months," said
<PERSON>Sen. Tom Daschle</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-S.D.</LOCATION>;    Shortly after the gulf war began, opponents of
government benefits in Agent Orange cases yielded to pressure from veterans'
advocates to expand protection for diseases attributed to the widely used
jungle defoliant, which has been linked to some forms of cancer.;    'Taking a
big step';  "As war rages in the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION>, we are taking a big step in
putting the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War behind us," said Rep. <PERSON>Lane Evans</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Ill.</LOCATION>, spokesman
for <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War-era veterans in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and a key sponsor of the Agent Orange
legislation.;    <ORGANIZATION>The Senate</ORGANIZATION> is expected to pass the bill <DATE>today</DATE> and send it to
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> for his signature. The administration backs the measure, in
part because it codifies into law the standards of the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Veterans
Affairs.</ORGANIZATION>;    In another action, the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> voted 414-0 for changes to the
Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act to increase protections for military
reservists called to active duty and others serving in the armed forces.;   
For example, the measure bars evictions of families of military personnel if
the amount of rent owed is less than <MONEY>$1,200</MONEY>, instead of <MONEY>$150</MONEY> provided under
current law. It also requires automatic reinstatement of health insurance for
those called to active duty and delays civil suits against members of the
armed forces until <DATE>July 1.</DATE>;    Permanent benefits;  Under the Agent Orange
legislation, <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans who suffer from two forms of cancer --
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and soft-tissue sarcoma -- would be entitled to
permanent disability benefits for themselves or their survivors. In addition,
those who contracted chloracne, a skin ailment, within one year of their
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> service would be eligible for benefits.;    In a provision that could
significantly expand existing benefits, the bill directs the <ORGANIZATION>National Academy
of Sciences</ORGANIZATION> to conduct comprehensive reviews of any evidence that Agent Orange
or other toxic chemicals used in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> caused cancer or other diseases in
veterans.;    If the academy recommends payment of disability benefits for a
disease related to exposure to Agent Orange, the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Veterans
Affairs</ORGANIZATION> must act within 60 days to accept the finding or justify its refusal
to pay compensation in such cases.;    The bill also authorizes federal
funding of as much as <MONEY>$4 million</MONEY> to test dioxin levels in the blood of
veterans who served in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and who may have been exposed to Agent Orange.
Money for this purpose also must be approved in a separate appropriations
bill, however.  </TEXT>

MUSTO EXPLORATIONS, the Canadian-owned mining group, is in talks with 18
international mining companies on the development of a USDollars
450m-Dollars 500m project in western <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>.
The company has a one year option to develop what it claims is a world-class
gold and copper deposit in the Andean foothills and is looking for partners
to share development costs.
It is close to completing an 18-month, Dollars 7m feasibility study of the
<ORGANIZATION>Bajo de la Alumbrera</ORGANIZATION> property for <ORGANIZATION>YMAD</ORGANIZATION>, a mining company owned by the local
provincial government of <LOCATION>Catamarca</LOCATION>. Musto intends to take up a one-year
option to develop the project in association with <ORGANIZATION>YMAD</ORGANIZATION> and international
investors.
If all goes well, the <LOCATION>Catamarca</LOCATION> mine would be the first major mining
investment in <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> in decades. <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s xenophobic mining laws once
discouraged investment, but in <DATE>June</DATE> it introduced new legislation
eliminating investment barriers.
<PERSON>Musto</PERSON> says <ORGANIZATION>Bajo de la Alumbrera</ORGANIZATION> is 'one of the largest proven unexploited
porphyry copper/gold deposits in <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>' and could produce 250m lb of
copper concentrate and 360,000 troy ounces of gold a year for 20 years.
Construction work would take two to three years before the mine could begin
production.
Among companies in talks with <PERSON>Musto</PERSON> are <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>American Barrick Resources</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Placer Dome</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>RTZ</ORGANIZATION>. Musto is also negotiating financial packages with <ORGANIZATION>First
Boston and Chase Manhattan</ORGANIZATION> banks.
Progress is being held up, however, by negotiations in the <LOCATION>Catamarca</LOCATION>
legislature over the royalties it will levy on the mine.
The federal government says that 20 local and foreign mining companies are
operating nine mines in <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and are considering 64 possible new
projects in which they have already invested Dollars 103m. Officials say
that two of the largest projects should attract investments of Dollars 500m.
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> may cut its tin output by 10 per cent next year because of low prices
in the world market, but is in no hurry to join the <ORGANIZATION>Association of Tin
Producing Countries</ORGANIZATION>, which is co-ordinating producer efforts to reduce world
supply, <PERSON>Mr Samuel Hanan</PERSON>, president of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s mining and construction
company <ORGANIZATION>Paranapanema</ORGANIZATION>, said yesterday, reports Reuter from <LOCATION>Kuala Lumpur</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr Hanan</PERSON>, who was attending an <ORGANIZATION>ATPC</ORGANIZATION> meeting here, said Brazilian exports
could also fall by 10 per cent in <DATE>1994</DATE> from 18,500 tonnes in <DATE>1993</DATE>, well
below an export limit of 24,000 agreed with the <ORGANIZATION>ATPC</ORGANIZATION>.

   I recently read <PERSON>William R. Havender</PERSON>'s review (<LOCATION>Bookshelf</LOCATION>, <DATE>Nov. 11</DATE>) of "Dioxin, Agent Orange: The Facts" by <PERSON>Michael Gough</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Havender</PERSON> states that, based on the information in this book, my father, Adm. <PERSON>E. R. Zumwalt Jr.</PERSON>, need not feel guilt for his son's and grandson's tragic health problems. 

   I agree that my father should not feel guilty about these problems and that only animal studies to date show birth defects. 
However, the conclusion that the evidence of cancer in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> vets from Agent Orange is exceedingly rare and a result from whatever it is that causes these conditions among ordinary Americans of similar age may need to be modified in the light of the most recent scientific study. 
That study, in the <DATE>Sept. 5</DATE> Journal of the <ORGANIZATION>American Medical Association</ORGANIZATION>, states, "Men exposed to herbicides more than twenty days per year had a sixfold increased risk of NHL (non-Hodgkins lymphoma) . . . relative to nonfarmers." 
A reading of that article and the editorial published with it clearly indicates that a study by the <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION> demonstrates that <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> farmers who used 2,4-D, one of the two principal elements in Agent Orange, without protective gear had six times more non-Hodgkins lymphoma. 

   Although <PERSON>Mr. Havender</PERSON> did a fine review of <PERSON>Mr. Gough</PERSON>'s book and presented some of the facts regarding Agent Orange, I believe your readers will be interested in the most recent scientific data.

PAINT, THE MOST versatile and affordable decorating tool, can be used in 
traditional, contemporary, artful, whimsical or zany applications. Here's a 
comprehensive guide for those who may attempt their own decorative painting on 
walls, ceilings, woodwork or furniture. Each technique is clearly illustrated 
step-by-step in color photographs. What the authors call basic finishes -- 
sponging, mutton clothing, ragging, color washing, combing, spattering -- are 
dealt with first. Then comes information on more advanced techniques -- gesso, 
marbling, porphyry, granite, moire, tortoise shell, wood finishes, wood 
graining, and gold leaf. A glossary further explains terms and techniques.

<LEADPARA>  President Bush, praising the U.S. military in the Persian Gulf as well as in
past wars, today ended a two-decade dispute by signing a bill to compensate
Vietnam War veterans exposed to Agent Orange.;    "A grateful nation salutes
our veterans," Bush said at a White House signing ceremony. He also signed a
bill giving a 5.4 percent cost-of-living increase in veterans benefits.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The Agent Orange measure permanently extends disability benefits to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>
veterans suffering from two types of cancer presumed to be caused by the
herbicide, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and soft-tissue sarcoma.;    Agent Orange
was sprayed by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> to defoliate jungle cover. For years,
the government refused to recognize a link between the herbicide and these
diseases.;    While some controversy still remains over the effect of Agent
Orange and its primary component, dioxin, the bill came to <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s desk with
the unanimous approval of both the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and Senate.;    Sponsors of the bill
said <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION>'s threat to use chemical and biological weapons against allied
troops contributed to the margin of passage.  </TEXT>

  [Abstract] Research on the reaction of ground water to 
disturbances caused by underground nuclear explosions was 
carried out during the period 1983-1989 using data from 96 
observation holes in the <LOCATION>Semipalatinsk</LOCATION> test range at distances 
0.3-10 km from the epicenter. The observations were made at the 
time of 44 underground nuclear explosions (29 in deep holes and 
15 in drifts) with a <ORGANIZATION>TNT</ORGANIZATION> equivalent from 6 to 150 kilotons. A 
change in hydrogeological conditions was caused by a change in 
the mechanical state of the rocks. The greatest change in water 
conductivity was observed in the neighborhood of holes 
containing the least water. In holes penetrating andesitic 
porphyries there was an average increase in water conductivity 
from 0.26 to 0.52 m[.sup]2[/]/day, corresponding to an 
increase in total rock porosity from 3.8 to <PERCENT>5.3%</PERCENT>. An 
underground nuclear explosion results in disruption of natural 
hydrogeological conditions in a region with a relative radius 
r/q[.sup]1/3[/] to 1000 m/kt[.sup]1/3[/], which is greater 
by an order of magnitude than the radius of the zone of 
fracturing induced during an explosion and which corresponds to 
the zone of irreversible local disruptions of the medium. 
Changes in hydrogeological conditions were caused by: an 
increase in the effective pressure of the fluid in water-bearing 
rocks; a change in the mechanical, and therefore, the filtration 
properties of reservoir rocks; formation of new filtration 
channels; formation of underground voids as a result of an 
explosion and their subsequent filling with ground water.

<HEAD>Most Vietnam Vets Escaped Heavy Exposure to Dioxin, Study Suggests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A veterans group criticized a new report by the
federal <ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION> that suggests most <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> GIs
escaped heavy exposure to the poison dioxin, unless they handled
the herbicide Agent Orange.
   ``This study seems to be pretty much the same data that was
released a year ago, only a year ago it was portrayed rather
differently,'' said <PERSON>Barry Kasinitz</PERSON>, a spokesman for the
35,000-member <ORGANIZATION>Vietnam Veterans of America</ORGANIZATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> last year concluded that exposure to dioxin could not be
determined using military records of troop locations and spraying
of Agent Orange, which contained the deadly poison.
   ``Now ... they are jumping to the conclusion that very few
people were exposed,'' <PERSON>Kasinitz</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in a telephone
interview from <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. ``That was a bit of a jump in logic that
doesn't seem to be substantiated.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION>'s new report, in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION>American Medical
Association</ORGANIZATION>, describes a comparison of blood tests between 646
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans and 97 non-Vietnam veterans.
   ``Current <ORGANIZATION>TCDD</ORGANIZATION> (dioxin) levels were nearly identical in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>
and non-Vietnam veterans,'' the researchers said.
   The latest study deliberately drew <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans from
battalions that had served in areas most heavily sprayed with Agent
Orange around <LOCATION>Saigon</LOCATION> in <DATE>1967</DATE> and <DATE>1968</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Only two <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans, or <PERCENT>0.3 percent</PERCENT> of all 646 tested, had
blood dioxin levels greater than 20 parts per trillion, considered
``clearly elevated,'' the researchers said.
   ``These two men each reported their health status as `excellent'
and did not attribute any health problems to Agent Orange
exposure,'' the researchers added.
   The two men were not among the <PERCENT>14 percent</PERCENT> of the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>
veterans in the study group who did link health problems to
exposure.
   ``This study is consistent with other studies and suggests that
most <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION> ground troops who served in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> were not heavily
exposed to <ORGANIZATION>TCDD</ORGANIZATION> (dioxin), except perhaps men whose job involved
handling herbicides,'' the researchers said.
   But <PERSON>Kasinitz</PERSON> said the new report gives the ``unfortunate''
impression that small exposures to dioxin were harmless, which has
not been proven, ``and that there is no need for the government to
act to assist those that have been harmed.''
   Dioxin stays in the bloodstream for many years, and high levels
of the chemical can be measured with blood tests as long as two
decades after someone has been exposed, the researchers said.
   Agent Orange was used as a defoliant in <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION> during
the <DATE>1960s</DATE> by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military. Some <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans contend it
has caused them such health problems as cancer, immune system
disorders and birth defects in their children.
   The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> just two months ago cleared the last
legal obstacle to a <MONEY>multimillion-dollar</MONEY> settlement that could
benefit up to 250,000 <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans in a class-action lawsuit
against the seven manufacturers of Agent Orange.
   But scientists are still trying to settle a continuing
controversy over exactly what health effects the dioxin in Agent
Orange may have.
   Dioxin is known to be one of the most powerful causes of cancer
in laboratory animals ever tested. It has not been shown to cause
cancer in humans, but the <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION>
classifies it as a probable carcinogen.
