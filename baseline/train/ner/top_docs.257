<HEAD>Antarctic Oil Spill Creates ``The Experiment Nobody Wanted''</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After decades of studying wildlife in an
unspoiled area of <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>, scientists have begun a new, unwelcome
line of research: the effects of an oil spill.
   ``This disaster is the experiment nobody wanted,'' said <ORGANIZATION>National
Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Jack Talmadge</PERSON>.
   By <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, American cleanup crews are expected to reach the area
affected by the sinking of an oil-laden supply ship, which ran
aground <DATE>Jan. 28</DATE> off the <LOCATION>Antarctic Peninsula</LOCATION>.
   Scientists have already seen oil-covered and apparently lethargic
seals, three dead penguins and disappearances of young nesting
birds, said <PERSON>Ted DeLaca</PERSON>, chief scientist of the foundation's division
of polar programs.
   Thirty-eight of 40 penguins checked <DATE>Friday</DATE> bore traces of oil.
Thousands of dead and dying krill, shrimplike crustaceans that are a
key food for bigger animals, have shown up on beaches, DeLaca told
reporters by telephone from <ORGANIZATION>Palmer Station</ORGANIZATION>, a research outpost near
the spill.
   ``All the principle (penguin) rookeries here are now surrounded
by fuel oil,'' he said. ``What its effect could be on the birds is
anybody's guess.''
   Adelie penguin chicks are expected to leave their nests for the
first time in a few days, swimming into contaminated waters. Other
birds are being exposed to the oil as they land on water or dive
into it to feed.
   Scientists are concerned that birds may freeze to death if the
oil disrupts their natural insulation, or be poisoned if they
swallow oil while preening themselves or eating oil-covered prey.
   The spill struck an area that has ``the largest and most diverse
plant and animal populations of the continent,'' said <PERSON>Polly Penhale</PERSON>,
manager of the science foundation's polar biology and medicine
program.
   Apart from the large seal population, about 30,000 sea birds live
there, including <LOCATION>Adelie</LOCATION> and chinstrap penguins, cormorants, kelp
gulls and giant petrels, she said.
   Scientists have studied wildlife in the area for more than 20
years, but now the pristine nature of the area has been altered.
   ``The paths of research that have been followed down there have
been forever changed,'' said <PERSON>Talmadge</PERSON>. ``I think if you're a
scientist in the year <DATE>2035</DATE>, you've got to remember there was an oil
spill.''
   DeLaca said the highly sensitive environment ``has been
compromised in a way that we can't even evaluate right now.''
   <PERSON>Langdon Quetin</PERSON>, research biologist at the <ORGANIZATION>University of
California</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION>, said if the oil spill causes dramatic
damage or long-term effects on plants and animals, ``then we can't
really depend on the area as a natural uncontaminated laboratory.''
   ``That really is unfortunate, to say the least, because it is one
of the few areas in the Antarctic we have good logistics to,'' he
said. ``It will be the ruination of a good laboratory, at least in
the near future, at least as a natural uncontaminated study area.''
   Some scientists are particularly concerned about fish and other
organisms kept in tanks at <LOCATION>Palmer Station</LOCATION>, which marine botanist
<PERSON>Mike Neushul</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Santa Barbara</ORGANIZATION> calls
``probably the best marine biology laboratory in the Antarctic.''
   The tanks draw water from the nearby harbor, and if oil
contaminates that supply, the experiments might have to be stopped.
Nobody knows yet whether that will be a problem, <PERSON>Penhale</PERSON> said.
   Neushul said one factor boding poorly for the area's wildlife is
that the spill involved fuel oil, which is ``much more toxic than
crude oil'' because it can damage biological tissue.
   Neushul, who investigated a spill of partially refined oil off
the <LOCATION>Baja California</LOCATION> coast some 30 years ago, said the effects of
that spill lasted 17 years.
   In addition, recovery in <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> may be prolonged because
bacteria there will need a long time to break the oil down, said
<PERSON>Paul Dayton</PERSON>, professor of marine ecology at the <ORGANIZATION>Scripps Institute of
Oceanography</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>La Jolla</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.

   Oil from a sunken ship off <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> threatens
not only the environment in a pristine bay, but also wildlife
research in a biologically rich area prized until now for its
unspoiled state, scientists say.
   ``The paths of research that have been followed down there have
been forever changed,'' said <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION> spokesman
<PERSON>Jack Talmadge</PERSON>. ``I think if you're a scientist in the year <DATE>2035</DATE>,
you've got to remember there was an oil spill.''
   <PERSON>Ted DeLaca</PERSON>, chief scientist of the foundation's polar programs,
said the highly sensitive environment ``has been compromised in a
way that we can't even evaluate right now.''
   While the spill's effect on future research cannot yet be
determined, ``it's something I find personally disturbing,'' he said
by telephone <DATE>Friday</DATE> from <ORGANIZATION>Palmer Station</ORGANIZATION>, a research outpost near the
spill.
   The oil is leaking from an Argentine research and supply ship
that ran aground <DATE>Jan. 25</DATE>. The ship is nearly submerged on shoals in
the <LOCATION>Bismarck Strait</LOCATION> just off the Antarctic peninsula, 600 miles from
the tip of <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>.
   Authorities said the ship carried at least 200,000 gallons of
fuel oil in its tanks and more in drums lashed to the deck. American
cleanup crews are expected to reach the site sometime this week.
   Some scientists said the effects of the spill may be magnified
because it involved fuel oil, more dangerous to wildlife than crude
oil, and because Antarctic conditions could slow the oil's
decomposition.
   The spill struck an area that has ``the largest and most diverse
plant and animal populations of the continent,'' said <PERSON>Polly Penhale</PERSON>,
manager of the science foundation's polar biology and medicine
program.
   Apart from a large seal population, some 30,000 sea birds live in
the area affected by the spill, including <ORGANIZATION>Adele</ORGANIZATION> and chinstrap
penguins, cormorants, kelp gulls and giant petrels, <PERSON>Penhale</PERSON> said.
   ``It is one of the most spectacularly beautiful areas in the
whole <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Sayed Z. El-Sayed</PERSON>, an oceanography
professor at <ORGANIZATION>Texas A&amp;M University</ORGANIZATION> who has studied it for 25 years.
   Most plants and animals live on islands off the mainland, where
the science foundation operates <ORGANIZATION>Palmer Station</ORGANIZATION> on a spit of rock.
   Scientists have already seen oil-covered and apparently lethargic
seals, three dead penguins and disappearances of young nesting
birds, <ORGANIZATION>DeLaca</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Thirty-eight of 40 penguins checked <DATE>Friday</DATE> bore traces of oil.
Thousands of dead and dying krill, shrimplike crustaceans that are a
key food for bigger animals, have shown up on beaches, he said.
   ``All the principal (penguin) rookeries here are now surrounded
by fuel oil,'' he said. ``What its effect could be on the birds is
anybody's guess.''
   Birds can freeze to death if the oil disrupts their natural
insulation, or be poisoned if they swallow oil while preening
themselves or eating contaminated prey.
   Scientists have studied wildlife in the area for more than 20
years, focusing on birds and seals and also on such organisms as
fish, kelp, krill and shelled animals called limpets.
   ``One of the main concerns of the scientists ... is that that
area stay pristine, because we have a lot of environmental research
that's going on,'' said <PERSON>Langdon Quetin</PERSON>, research biologist at the
<ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION>.
   ``It is one of the few areas in the Antarctic we have good
logistics to,'' he said. The spill ``will be the ruination of a good
laboratory, at least in the near future, at least as a natural
uncontaminated study area.''
   Some scientists are particularly concerned about fish and other

   The tanks draw seawater from the nearby harbor, and if oil
contaminates that supply, the experiments might have to be stopped.
Nobody knows yet whether that will be a problem, <PERSON>Penhale</PERSON> said.
   Neushul said one factor boding poorly for the area's wildlife is
that the spill involved fuel oil, which is much more toxic than
crude oil because it can damage biological tissue.
   Neushul, who investigated a spill of partially refined oil off
<LOCATION>Baja California</LOCATION> 30 years ago, said that spill caused mass deaths of
fish, starfish, sea urchins and other animals. The same may happen
to similar animals in the Antarctic, he said.
   In the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> spill, the environment took 17 years to
recover, he said. Recovery in <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> may take even longer
because bacteria there will need a long time to break the oil down,
said <PERSON>Paul Dayton</PERSON>, professor of marine ecology at the <ORGANIZATION>Scripps
Institute of Oceanography</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>La Jolla</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.
   After years of studying wildlife in a pristine environment,
researchers are now turning to monitor how the wildlife responds to
the oil spill, <PERSON>Talmadge</PERSON> said. ``This disaster is the experiment
nobody wanted,'' he said.

THINGS HATCHING AT SEA WORLD'S PENGUIN ENCOUNTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
At 10 degrees below freezing, the delivery room at <LOCATION>Sea World</LOCATION> is colder than 
most. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, however, a record-breaking number of feathered couples have 
become parents at the marine park's "Penguin Encounter," and recently the 45 
tiny hatchlings have started to get some notice. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, the glassed-in, 5,000-square-foot cold climate exhibit has begun to 
resemble a hospital infant ward, as park visitors strain to get a glimpse of 
the 14 fast-growing adelie penguins that are just beginning to venture outside 
their nests. 
</P>
<P>
But some of the the most exciting additions to the park's penguin colony are 
not yet on public display. Besides 23 more adelies, two baby gentoo penguins 
are being hand-raised by park keepers, the first gentoos to be born from eggs 
laid in captivity at <LOCATION>Sea World</LOCATION>. Six baby Humboldt penguins are being 
hand-raised as well, and keepers say that, by observing the young, they hope to 
learn more about preserving Humboldts, the one penguin species that is 
endangered. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was a oil spill off the coast of <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION> where the Humboldts 
are, that could disrupt the whole species," said <PERSON>Joop Kuhn</PERSON>, supervisor of 
aviculture at <ORGANIZATION>Sea World</ORGANIZATION>. "We'd need to know what to feed them, how often, how 
much. But we're getting a pretty good understanding -- we'd know where to 
start." 
</P>
<P>
With more than 500 penguins, the marine park's 6-year-old exhibit is the 
largest penguin colony outside of the Antarctic. As part of a project conducted 
with the <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, the park keeps detailed records on each 
penguin from nine species. 
</P>
<P>
There's a file, for example, on <ORGANIZATION>King Tut</ORGANIZATION>, the first king penguin park keepers 
hand-raised from an egg that was laid in the wild. There's another on <ORGANIZATION>Elvis</ORGANIZATION>, 
another king penguin named for the "king of rock 'n' roll," <PERSON>Kuhn</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Files include personal details, he said: "Who they're paired up with, how many 
offspring they've had, if they've changed mates -- for the most part, they're 
monogamous, but we've seen a slight divorce rate in our enclosure." 
</P>
<P>
Park experts know which birds have showed a knack for keeping their eggs warm, 
and which birds have wandered off to let the eggs fend for themselves. They 
know that a penguin lays two eggs, as they often do, as a kind of "insurance," 
<PERSON>Kuhn</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"Most penguin species will lay two eggs 
</P>
<P>
but rarely will they be able to raise both young. It's survival of the 
fittest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But park keepers, eager to supplement their growing colony, have begun rescuing 
the second eggs from the nests before they hatch. 
</P>
<P>
"Mother Nature is very tough on her own. We try to sort of soften that by 
artificial incubating," <PERSON>Kuhn</PERSON> said. "If we take one egg from our birds, and 
leave them with one, they will put all their effort and energy there." 
</P>
<P>
The hand-raised babies are treated to what keepers call penguin milkshakes, a 
tasty mixture of herring filets, shrimp-like crustaceans, half-and-half cream, 
water and vitamins that is heated to 90 degrees to resemble the regurgitated 
meals their parents would feed them in the wild, <PERSON>Kuhn</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kuhn</PERSON> said the park had also hoped to hatch some chinstrap penguins this year, 
which have never been hatched in captivity. Chinstrap penguins, named for the 
black stripe across their necks, laid eggs for the first time at <LOCATION>Sea World</LOCATION> this 
year. But the eggs proved infertile. 
</P>
<P>
"The first year they try and do it," <PERSON>Kuhn</PERSON> said. "They do their best sitting on 
the eggs. Hopefully, by the second year, they've figured out the copulation 
thing and see if they can pull it off."

At 22 degrees Fahrenheit, the delivery room at Sea World may be colder than

<P>
In fact, more feathered couples than ever are becoming parents at the marine

   A ship laden with more than 50 tons of
equipment headed toward the Antarctic today to try and contain an
oil spill that experts say is killing wildlife and threatening to
wipe out a colony of baby penguins.
   The spill, from a sunken Argentine supply ship, has fouled the
once-pure waters of a pristine bay and was endangering more than
24,000 penguins and other nesting birds, said biologist <PERSON>Ted De Laca</PERSON>.
   ``It's very disturbing. Everything right now is worrisome,'' said
<PERSON>De Laca</PERSON>, a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION>Palmer Station</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> research outpost
on the <LOCATION>Antarctic Peninsula</LOCATION>.
   About 52 tons of equipment flown from the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> was
loaded onto the 219-foot <ORGANIZATION>Polar Duke</ORGANIZATION> here from a giant <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Air Force
C-5 Galaxy</ORGANIZATION> cargo plane.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Polar Duke</ORGANIZATION> departed shortly after <TIME>6 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE> and was
expected to reach the area in four days.
   The oil is leaking from the Argentine research and supply ship
<LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION>, which is trapped and nearly submerged on shoals in
the <LOCATION>Bismarck Strait</LOCATION> just off the Antarctic peninsula.
   Thousands of penguins, terns, gulls and other birds live around
the site of the accident, and the waters teem with marine life,
including whales. Two areas nearby are set aside by the Antarctic
Treaty for scientific study.
   Punta Arenas is at the windblown tip of <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION> about 600
miles from the stricken Argentine vessel.
   <PERSON>Thomas Forhan</PERSON>, ocean projects manager for the <ORGANIZATION>National Science
Foundation</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, leads the cleanup mission.
   American scientists, wearing respirators as protection against
the smell of oil fumes, are working in open boats to try to limit
the damage, but De <PERSON>Laca</PERSON> said ``virtually all of the area is exposed
to fuel,'' causing young birds to disappear and killing small sea
animals ``in large numbers.''
   De <PERSON>Laca</PERSON> spoke by telephone with the <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   About 24,000 penguins nest in rookeries in the affected area, and
De <PERSON>Laca</PERSON> said 38 of the 40 adult birds checked by scientists have
been ``fuel-dipped.''
   The fear of the experts, he said, is that penguin chicks, due to
leave nests within a few days, will swim in the oil-coated water and
be sickened or killed. At least three dead penguins have been
sighted, said De <PERSON>Laca</PERSON>.
   ``All of the rookeries are surrounded by oil,'' he said.
   A number of seals were seen to be covered with oil and were
acting in a ``lethargic fashion,'' said the scientist.
   ``We have a slick 150 meters (yards) by 2 miles long going south
from the vessel,'' moving ``along and a little bit away'' from the
coast, <PERSON>Forhan</PERSON> said in an interview aboard the <ORGANIZATION>Polar Duke</ORGANIZATION>.
   He said there were reports of birds smothered by oil and of dead
krill, shrimp-like creatures that whales feed upon in large numbers,
floating ashore.
   Scientists and workers at <ORGANIZATION>Palmer Station</ORGANIZATION> collected 112 compressed
gas cylinders and 15 oil drums from the waters around the wreck,
<PERSON>Forhan</PERSON> said, and ``there are more in the water.''
   The <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION> ran aground <DATE>Jan. 25</DATE>. The more than 250 people
aboard were taken off without injury.
   Authorities said the ship carried at least 200,000 gallons of
fuel oil in its tanks and more in drums lashed to the deck.

   A <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> team of experts and 50 tons of
equipment headed to the Antarctic on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to battle a huge oil
spill that experts said was killing wildlife in the pristine polar
region.
   A <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Air Force</ORGANIZATION> cargo plane was bound for the southern city of
<LOCATION>Punta Arenas</LOCATION>, where the equipment will be transferred to a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
research vessel, the <ORGANIZATION>Polar Duke</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> said.
   Officials stressed they still were trying to assess the magnitude
of the spill, which was caused by a sunken Argentine supply ship,
but said it represented the first major environmental threat to the
Antarctic.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> said the crippled
Argentine ship carried 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel and that an
``incurable disaster'' would result if all the fuel leaked into the
unspoiled waters in the region.
   In <PERSON>Buenos Aires</PERSON>, the Argentine navy played down the spill and
said it did not pose a serious ecological threat.
   But <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> launched a massive effort to stem
the spill, which was four miles in diameter and moving to the
southwest, said <PERSON>Jack Talmadge</PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>National Science
Foundation</ORGANIZATION>.
   The spill occurred after the <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Paradise Bay</ORGANIZATION>), an
Argentine navy vessel, ran aground on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> in the <LOCATION>Bismarck
Strait</LOCATION>, about 600 miles south of the southern tip of <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>
and 1{ miles from the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Palmer Research Station</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>.
   All passengers and crew were rescued, but the vessel floated free
in heavy seas and then capsized <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, spilling barrels of
oil and several hundred propane gas containers into the water,
<PERSON>Talmadge</PERSON> said.
   ``It has leaked oil,'' he said. ``We're not sure whether the oil
leak is continuing. The water surrounding the ship is covered with a
couple of centimeters (about an inch) of oil. There is a sheen of
oil in a much wider area around the ship, including evidence of oil
on the coastline of the several islands there.''
   A private yacht 10-15 miles away reported earlier that it had
seen oil patches on the water, he said. Oil also was spotted at the
research station.
   ``Wildlife has already begun to be affected,'' including krill,
the small crustaceans that form the basis of the Antarctic food
chain, <PERSON>Talmadge</PERSON> said.
   ``Birds which have eaten the krill are showing behavior
differences,'' he said. ``One dead penguin had been found as of a
few hours ago.''
   A <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION> statement said about 12,000 pairs
of penguins and other sea birds nested in the area last year.
   ``In a few weeks, hatchling penguins will leave their nests and
enter the now-fouled Antarctic waters, as will their parents,'' said
the statement.
   A team of 15 experts and 52 tons of equipment on a giant <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Air
Force</ORGANIZATION> C-5B cargo plane left <LOCATION>Norfolk</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. It was to
arrive here on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> and then go by ship across the <ORGANIZATION>Drake Passage</ORGANIZATION>
to the accident site along the <LOCATION>Antarctic Peninsula</LOCATION> by <DATE>Monday</DATE>,
<PERSON>Talmadge</PERSON> said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION> manages the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Antarctic
Program, which includes <ORGANIZATION>Palmer Station</ORGANIZATION>, a scientific outpost.
   <PERSON>Talmadge</PERSON> said scientists from the station have been going out in
boats to assess the damage and try to catch the oil barrels and
propane containers floating in the water.
   ``We're trying to get those, but that's a pretty massive
project,'' he said. ``We're using all the lifeboats from the ship
and any other boats we can get hold of in the area.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION> is organizing the clean-up
mission, with assistance from the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Air Force</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> and the
<ORGANIZATION>National Oceanographic</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Atmospheric Administration</ORGANIZATION>.
   In <PERSON>Buenos Aires</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>Argentine navy</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said: ``There could
be a small stain'' from the release of oil in the engine room of the
ship. ``Anything else, no,'' He said.
   The ship carried tourists as well as fuel for several polar
stations. All 300 ship occupants were taken to the <PERSON>Palmer</PERSON> station
after the vessel ran aground.
   Another <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Jack
Renerie</PERSON>, said in a telephone interview that the cargo plane was
carrying a 35-foot ``skimming boat'' for scooping up spilled oil and
pumping it into floating tanks; a small tugboat; inflatable booms to
contain the spill, and a special truck for loading and unloading the
equipment.
   He said it was accompanied by a crew from two private <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
clean-up companies, <ORGANIZATION>Marine Polution Control and Global Associates</ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Baby Gulls Dying From Antarctic Oil Slick</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chilean frogmen worked to stop oil from
leaking from a partially submerged ship off <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>, authorities
said, and a report <DATE>today</DATE> said thousands of polar seabirds have
already died near the spreading slick.
   Crewmen from the Chilean cutter Yelcho on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> encircled the
nearly sunken <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> vessel <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION> with floating booms
designed to contain any further leakage, said a navy communique
released in <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>New Zealand Press Association</ORGANIZATION> today reported that thousands of
baby Polar Skua gulls had died because their parents were unable to
find food.
   The predatory birds also can freeze to death if the oil disrupts
their natural insulation or be poisoned if they swallow oil while
preening themselves or eat contaminated prey.
   The news agency, citing unidentified scientists at the nearby
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Palmer Station on the <LOCATION>Antarctic Peninsula</LOCATION>, said the oil slick
has surrounded penguin rookeries near the wrecked ship.
   An operator reached by telephone at the research station referred
all inquiries to the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION>,
which oversees the base 590 miles from the tip of <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>.
   The Argentine research and supply ship grounded on shoals <DATE>Jan. 28</DATE>.
   The ship holds about 800 tons of fuel, including diesel oil in
bulk and aviation fuel in steel drums. The <ORGANIZATION>National Science
Foundation</ORGANIZATION> says oil is leaking slowly from the ship, which gradually
sank in the shallow waters. Only a section of its superstructure
remains above the surface.
   Foundation officials said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that a slick nearly 500 feet
wide and two miles long was trailing away from the vessel toward the
south, threatening the frozen continent's fragile and unspoiled
environment. Today's <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> report said the slick was four
miles long. It did not mention width.
   A <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> research vessel, the <ORGANIZATION>Polar Duke</ORGANIZATION>, was expected to join
cleanup efforts. It carries military and civilian experts and 52
tons of sophisticated equipment.
   A research vessel of the <ORGANIZATION>Chilean Antarctic Institute</ORGANIZATION> also was at
the spill site evaluating environmental damage, said the insitute's
director, <PERSON>Antonio Massei</PERSON>.
   In a telephone interview in <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>, he said the area around the
accident is home to 29,000 penguins. Scientists say many baby
penguins soon will take their first swim in the waters, and they are
worried the youngsters could suffocate in the oil.
   Other wildlife also is threatened, including krill, a tiny
shrimp-like crustacean considered a vital link in <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>'s food
chain.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> researchers say a number of seals were seen covered with oil
and moving slowly in the waters.
   Both the <PERSON>Yelcho</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>Polar Duke</ORGANIZATION> left <DATE>Friday</DATE> from the Chilean
port of <ORGANIZATION>Punta Arenas</ORGANIZATION>, a major supply point for Antarctic operations.
   Two Argentine vessels were in the area of the spill and planned
to help, according to the Chilean navy. However, the ships were
awaiting equipment being flown from <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> to a Chilean-run base
200 miles from the wreckage.

<HEAD>Environmental Damage Grows From Antarctica Fuel Oil Spill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Birds and other wildlife in one of the most
remote parts of the world are being injured and killed by fuel oil
spilled from a ship wrecked on an <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> island, and more damage
is possible before cleanup crews arrive.
   Biologist <PERSON>Ted De Laca</PERSON>, chief scientist at <ORGANIZATION>Palmer Station</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>, said that more than 24,000 penguins and other birds are
endangered by an oil spill that threatens to wipe an entire
generation of chicks maturing in nests surrounded by the pollution.
Some wildlife already has been killed, he said.
   ``The environment has been compromised in a way that we can't
even evaluate right now,'' De <PERSON>Laca</PERSON> said in a telephone conference
call from <ORGANIZATION>Palmer Station</ORGANIZATION>. ``It's very disturbing. Everything right
now is worrisome.''
   Palmer Station scientists, wearing respirators to protect against
the eye-stinging fumes of the oil slick, worked in open boats to
recover debris littering the fouled bay and to evaluate the damage.
   But De <PERSON>Laca</PERSON> said a more effective effort to contain the spill
must await the arrival <DATE>Monday</DATE> of a <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> oil pollution control team
from the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   He said the fuel oil is spilling from the Argentine ship <LOCATION>Bahia
Paraiso</LOCATION> at the rate of about two gallons a minute and if it
continues the vessel could dump about 250,000 gallons into the
previously pure, untainted waters nearby.
   The ship, which doubled as a cruise ship and a supply vessel for
an Argentine research station, ran aground near <LOCATION>Palmer Station</LOCATION> <DATE>last
Saturday</DATE>. It later floated free, went aground again 1.1 miles from
the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> outpost and then turned over on its right side against
another island. As it turned, fuel oil and deck cargo spilled into
the <PERSON>Palmer</PERSON> Station embayment, home to a number of large bird
rookeries.
   <ORGANIZATION>Palmer Station</ORGANIZATION> is a <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION> research station.
Twenty-six scientists and staff are now working at the station under
the director of De <PERSON>Laca</PERSON>, the chief scientist. Palmer is about 600
miles south of <LOCATION>Cape Horn</LOCATION>, the tip of <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>.
   De <PERSON>Laca</PERSON> reported that krill, a tiny shrimp-like crustacean, have
been killed by the thousands and are lining the nearby beaches.
Birds feeding on the krill seem sickened, he said. In a nesting area
of the <ORGANIZATION>Polar Skua</ORGANIZATION>, a bird of prey, up to <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> of the chicks
have disappeared, possibily because parent birds sickened by the oil
are unable to protect their young, he said.
   About 24,000 penguins nest in rookies in the affected area, and
De <PERSON>Laca</PERSON> said that 38 of 40 adult birds checked by scientists have
been ``fuel dipped.''
   A number of seals were seen to be covered with oil and were
acting in a ``lethargic fashion,'' said the scientist.
   The precise number of animals killed by the oil is difficult to
calculate because other animals quickly eat the dead. ``It's pretty
depressing,'' he said.

<HEAD>Argentine Navy Ends Oil Spill Cleanup Efforts, Claims No Damage</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deteriorating weather has forced the Argentine
navy to halt efforts to clean up a fuel oil spill from a ship that
went aground <DATE>Jan. 28</DATE> near an American Antarctic research station.
   A statement released <DATE>Thursday</DATE> by the <ORGANIZATION>Argentine Embassy</ORGANIZATION> said that
five Argentine naval ships that had been participating in
contamination control work were being withdrawn ``due to glacier and
meteorological conditions.''
   The statement said that oil spilled from the Argentine supply
ship <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION> has been removed from the sea surface and that
all ``potential pollutants'' have been removed from the wrecked ship.
   American experts, however, say about 50,000 gallons of fuel oil
are still aboard the <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION>
spokesman <PERSON>Jack Talmadge</PERSON> said that ``there has never been ship with
oil in it that withstood an <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> winter.''
   ``We're concerned about what might happen over the <DATE>winter</DATE>,'' he
said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Bahia Paraiso</ORGANIZATION> lodged on rocks on <LOCATION>DeLaca Island</LOCATION> near the
<PERSON>Palmer</PERSON> station and dumped about 170,000 gallons of diesel and jet
fuel into the pristine waters nearby. An American research camp
called <ORGANIZATION>Palmer Station</ORGANIZATION> is 1.1 miles away.
   Experts from the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> stopped further
leaks from the vessel and cleaned up much of the oil, but the
Argentine navy now is leaving the scene while tons of fuel remain in
the <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION> tanks.
   <PERSON>Talmadge</PERSON> said the vessel could quite likely be susceptible to
shifting by the force of ice and tide through the winter.
   The approaching Antarctic winter will not halt American efforts,
<PERSON>Talmadge</PERSON> said, because the <ORGANIZATION>NSF</ORGANIZATION> icebreaker <ORGANIZATION>Polar Duke</ORGANIZATION> is able to
operate out of <ORGANIZATION>Palmer Station</ORGANIZATION> in virtually all seasons.
   The Argentine statement also claimed that ``no visible harm to
the local ecosystem was noticed, especially with respect to its
fauna.''
   But experts at the <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, which operates
the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> research program in the region, said that the spill of fuel
oil from the <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION> did cause some loss of wildlife in the
area near <LOCATION>Palmer Station</LOCATION>, and that the eventual impact of the spill
may not be known for years.
   An extra team of American scientists went to <ORGANIZATION>Palmer Station</ORGANIZATION>
earlier this month to conduct new studies on the effects of the fuel
oil spill. They are expected to return in <DATE>April</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>NSF</ORGANIZATION> scientists have been monitoring the effects of the spill
since the ship first went aground and have reported:
   _Among a population of 30,000 birds of at least eight species,
fewer than 30 are known to have died directly as a result of
ingesting the fuel oil. However, there is indirect evidence of other
losses.
   _Penguins returning to the sea after nesting were forced to swim
through oil-covered water. Some penguins now are apparently being
eaten at sea by giant petrels, a long-winged bird. ``This diet,
unusual for petrels, is evidence that the oil spill affected
penguins,'' an <ORGANIZATION>NSF</ORGANIZATION> statement says.
   _An entire generation of <LOCATION>South Polar</LOCATION> skuas died in one rookery
near <LOCATION>Palmer Station</LOCATION>. The skua is a gull-like bird of prey. <ORGANIZATION>NSF</ORGANIZATION>
experts said skua parents were apparently affected by the oil spill
and failed to protect their nestlings from other skuas and other
predatory birds. There are, however, many skua rookeries in the
<LOCATION>South Polar</LOCATION> region.
   _The loss most feared by scientists is that the area around
<LOCATION>Palmer Station</LOCATION>, which has been a science outpost for 20 years, may
no longer be suitable for study because of distortions caused by the
oil spill. ``The usefulness of ... Palmer Station for basic research
(of) the undisturbed Antarctic ecosystem is in question,'' an <ORGANIZATION>NSF</ORGANIZATION>
statement said.

   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> experts with 52 tons of cleanup gear
were bound for <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> to tackle a fuel oil spill
that officials said threatened baby penguins about to take their
first swim.
   A giant <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Air Force</ORGANIZATION> C-5 Galaxy cargo plane carrying the gear
and experts landed in <LOCATION>Punta Arenas</LOCATION>, on the straits of <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, the
official news agency <PERSON>Orbe</PERSON> reported.
   From there, the mission was to board the <ORGANIZATION>Polar Duke</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
research ship bound for the spill, about 590 miles south of the <LOCATION>Cape
Horn</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Anton L. Inderbitzen</PERSON>, head of Antarctic staff for the
Washington-based <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION>Polar Duke</ORGANIZATION>
was to depart <DATE>Friday</DATE> and take about four days to reach the spill,
just off the <LOCATION>Antarctic Peninsula</LOCATION> and about two miles from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
scientific base <ORGANIZATION>Palmer Station</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Our concern right now is primarily for the birds,'' he told
reporters at <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>'s airport. ``All the young penguins are just
about at the age where they take their first swim.
   ``When these birds enter the water for the first time, it could
be the last time.''
   There were conflicting reports of the extent of the spill, which
occurred when an Argentine research and supply boat hit a rock
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> and listed before sinking <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   The 9,300-ton vessel, the <LOCATION>Paradise Bay</LOCATION>, was carrying 250,000
gallons of diesel fuel, according to the <ORGANIZATION>Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION>.
   The boat was leaking fuel oil at an undetermined rate, and
hundreds of drums of oil and canisters of compressed gas had slipped
from its decks, the foundation said.
   A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Argentine Ministry of Defense</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>
``there really wasn't a (significant) spill.''
   A short communique issued by the <ORGANIZATION>Argentine navy</ORGANIZATION> said its planes
will fly over the sunken vessel ``to make a visual evaulation of the
damage and take photographs that allow us to decide the best means
to employ to combat the effects that could be presented.''
   Also, an icebreaker was to arrive at the scene <DATE>Friday</DATE> to ``assess
the best ways available to combat the pollution,'' the communique
said.
   Some environmental experts and scientific groups have said
hundreds of gallons of fuel oil leaked from the ship and created a
slick up to 16 miles long, but the <ORGANIZATION>Chilean navy</ORGANIZATION> said the reports
appeared exaggerated.
   ``The information that we have is that there is no big spill,''
said <ORGANIZATION>navy</ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. <PERSON>Juan Pablo Barros</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Jack Renirie</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said, however, that
a slick did exist and that personnel at <LOCATION>Palmer Station</LOCATION> were
gathering drums of fuel oil and tanks of compressed gas from around
the grounded ship.
   ``The latest we have now is that there's probably 150 to 200
barrels in the water'' that slipped from the vessel's deck, <PERSON>Renirie</PERSON>
said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>. ``And there's still oil
coming out of the ship.''
   Inderbitzen said the <ORGANIZATION>Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, which organized the
cleanup mission and directs all <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> activities in <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>,
feared lasting environmental damage.
   Some dead penguins had already been sighted, and the slick had
caused isolated schools of krill, a shrimp-like animal, to surface,
<PERSON>Renirie</PERSON> said.
   Inderbitzen said <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>'s delicate, unspoiled environment
requires special measures to contain the spill, which is near two
areas set aside for special scientific study under terms of the
<ORGANIZATION>Antarctic Treaty</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``In warm weather it's easier for plants and even animals to
recover from an accident,'' he said. ``But in <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>, it takes
plants and animals many, many years to recover because of the cold.
It's a very, very fragile environment.''
   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> cargo plane, which is twice the size of a <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> 747,
carries a 35-foot ``skimming boat'' for scooping up spilled oil and
pumping it into floating tanks, and a small tugboat and inflatable
booms to contain drifting oil.
   The cleanup work will be peformed by <ORGANIZATION>Marine Pollution Control
Co.</ORGANIZATION>, under contract to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Navy</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Renirie</PERSON> said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Chilean navy</ORGANIZATION> said it will provide logistical support and
dispatch its own ship with scientists and equipment to assist ``in
case any contamination exists.''

<TEXT>
   Damage to the pristine Antarctic
environment from an Argentine ship that ran aground and leaked oil
appears to be less than initially feared, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> scientist reported
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> .
   ``There were not thousands of birds killed. What we saw was the
death of a few birds and there may be more,'' said <PERSON>Ted DeLaca</PERSON>, chief
of the <ORGANIZATION>Division of Polar Programs</ORGANIZATION> of the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION>National
Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Some said this was an eco-catastrophe of biblical proportions.
That clearly is not true. Others said it was nothing. That's not
true, either. The truth is somewhere in between.''
   Many krill, a small, shrimplike crustacean that is the main food
for whalebone whales, washed up on islands after the <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION>
ran aground on <DATE>Jan. 28</DATE> and began leaking fuel oil.
   The Argentine navy oceanographic vessel had been chartered for a
tourist excursion.
   The accident took place near the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> polar research station
<PERSON>Palmer</PERSON> on the Antarctic peninsula, 600 miles below the tip of <LOCATION>South
America</LOCATION>. DeLaca was on the scene and helped organize the transfer of
tourists from ship to land by motorized rubber boats.
   The partially submerged ship was carrying an estimated 800 tons
of diesel oil, butane, compressed gas and other fuel, which
immediately began to leak. How much leaked and how much will be
recovered was not known, <PERSON>DeLaca</PERSON> said.
   He said some penguins and cormorants died after ingesting oil or
getting it on themselves, and thousands of limpets, a small, marine
animal, also died.
   However, navy experts from <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> and scientists
aboard the foundation vessel Polar Duke quickly recovered floating
fuel canisters, patched the <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION>'s hull, stopped the leak
and contained the spill and now are cleaning it up.
   ``For the most part, the stuff that went into the water seems to
have dispersed and gone away,'' DeLaca, a bearded, 45-year-old
marine microbiologist, said in an interview.
   The concern now is what possible long-term effects the spill may
have on animal and plant life and on research such as that conducted
at Palmer since <DATE>1970</DATE>.
   ``The Antarctic is a hostile, unforgiving environment,'' <PERSON>DeLaca</PERSON>
said. ``The organisms that live there are specially adapted. The
margins for survival are narrow. ... Anything that takes away an
edge, that compromises their fitness, could mean the difference
between life and death.''
   He said ingesting oil may affect the penguins' capacity to store
oxygen and thus their ability to dive deep for food. Oil on the
feathers of skuas, a large predator bird related to the seagull,
could affect their ability to float or stay warm.
   Lack of limpets and krill near a nesting may affect breeding
patterns and the ability of young creatures to survive, he said.
   He said researchers also will wonder now whether the results they
obtain are valid, or a reflection of the oil spill.
   ``This is the first significant spill in <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>DeLaca</PERSON>
said. ``It was a pristine environment and experimental results were
taken as accurate indicators of the Antarctic environment. This
spill could call into question future results.''
   A team of scientists from the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>
will arrive at <LOCATION>Palmer Station</LOCATION> next month to collect data before
<DATE>winter</DATE> sets in.
   ``When next <DATE>spring</DATE> comes is when the story will be told'' about
the damage caused by the spill, <ORGANIZATION>DeLaca</ORGANIZATION> said.
   ``The environment will recover. No question about that. The
question is, is what comes back what was there before.''

   Chilean navy frogmen plunged into icy
Antarctic waters <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to seal shut the fuel tanks of a crippled
ship and stop the spread of an oil slick threatening the pristine
area's wildlife, authorities said.
   A navy communique said the cutter <PERSON>Yelcho</PERSON> arrived <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>,
the first cleanup vessel to get to the spill site 590 miles from the
tip of <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION> and close to the shores of the <LOCATION>Antarctic

   Crew members <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> morning encircled the nearly sunken vessel
Bahia Paraiso (<ORGANIZATION>Paradise Bay</ORGANIZATION>) with floating booms designed to contain
any further oil leak, according to the communique read by a
spokesman at <ORGANIZATION>navy</ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>.
   Divers then entered the frigid waters to seal shut the <LOCATION>Bahia
Paraiso</LOCATION>'s tanks, it said.
   The Argentine research and supply ship grounded on shoals <DATE>Jan. 28</DATE>
about two miles from <LOCATION>Palmer Station U.S.</LOCATION> research base. Scientists
say the area teams with wildlife, including thousands of penguins.
   The ship holds about 800 tons of fuel, including diesel oil in
bulk and aviation fuel in steel drums. Officials of the
Washington-based <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION> say oil is leaking
slowly from the ship, which gradually sank in the shallow waters.
Only a section of its superstructure remains above the surface.
   They say a slick nearly 500 feet wide and two miles long is
trailing away from the vessel toward the south, threatening the
frozen continent's fragile and unspoiled environment.
   A <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> research vessel, the <ORGANIZATION>Polar Duke</ORGANIZATION>, was expected to arrive at
the spill later <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. It carries a multimillion-dollar cleanup
mission organized by the <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION> that includes
military and civilian experts and 52 tons of sophisticated equipment.
   Both the <PERSON>Yelcho</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>Polar Duke</ORGANIZATION> left <DATE>Friday</DATE> from the Chilean
port of <ORGANIZATION>Punta Arenas</ORGANIZATION>, a major supply point for Antarctic operations.
   Two Argentine vessels are in the area of the spill and plan to
help, according to the Chilean navy. However, they await equipment
being flown from <PERSON>Buenos Aires</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, to a Chilean-run Antarctic
base 200 miles from the accident.
   An <ORGANIZATION>Argentine Embassy</ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> told reporters <DATE>Monday</DATE>
the government would try to salvage the <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION> once the
environmental threat is stemmed.
   A research vessel of the <ORGANIZATION>Chilean Antarctic Institute</ORGANIZATION> also is at

   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> experts were en route today to

board on a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> research ship departing today for the spill, about
590 miles south of the <LOCATION>Cape Horn</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Anton Inderbitzen</PERSON>, head of Antarctic staff for the
Washington-based <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, said the vessel <ORGANIZATION>Polar
Duke</ORGANIZATION> would take about four days to reach the spill, just off the
<LOCATION>Antarctic Peninsula</LOCATION> and about two miles from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> scientific
base <ORGANIZATION>Palmer Station</ORGANIZATION>.
   However, a <ORGANIZATION>Greenpeace</ORGANIZATION> spokesman cautioned that less than two
months remain to contain the damage.
   ``They can't hang around too long,'' said <PERSON>Peter Wilkinson</PERSON> from
the <ORGANIZATION>Greenpeace</ORGANIZATION> ship <LOCATION>Gondwana</LOCATION> in Antarctic waters. ``By mid- to
late-April the ice will start to freeze over.''
   ``Any ship that's underwater in <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> with that amount of
fuel poses a big problem,'' he said in a radio telephone interview
to <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.
   The environmental group is calling for an international effort to
contain damage caused by the sinking <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> of an Argentine navy
vessel that, according to the <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, was
carrying 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel.
   In a stop in <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, Inderbitzen told reporters the
crew would focus efforts on saving baby penguins in the polluted
area.
   ``All the young penguins are just about at the age where they
take their first swim,'' he said. ``When these birds enter the water
for the first time, it could be the last time.''
   The 9,300-ton <LOCATION>Paradise Bay</LOCATION> was leaking fuel oil at an
undetermined rate, and hundreds of drums of oil and canisters of
compressed gas had slipped from its decks, the foundation said.
   A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Argentine Ministry of Defense</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>,
``There really wasn't a (significant) spill.''
   An Argentine navy statement said an icebreaker was to arrive at
the scene today to ``assess the best ways available to combat the
pollution.''
   Some environmental experts and scientific groups have said
hundreds of gallons of fuel leaked from the ship and created a slick
up to 16 miles long, but the <ORGANIZATION>Chilean navy</ORGANIZATION> said the reports appeared
exaggerated.
   ``The information that we have is that there is no big spill,''
said a navy snnel at <LOCATION>Palmer Station</LOCATION> were
gathering drums of fuel oil and tanks of compressed gas from around
the grounded ship.
   ``The latest we have now is that there's probably 150 to 200
barrels in the water,'' <PERSON>Renirie</PERSON> said in a telephone interview from
<LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>. ``And there's still oil coming out of the ship.''
   Inderbitzen said the <ORGANIZATION>Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, which organized the
cleanup mission and directs all <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> activities in <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>,
feared lasting environmental damage.
   Some dead penguins had already been sighted, and the slick had
caused isolated schools of krill, a shrimp-like animal, to surface,
<PERSON>Renirie</PERSON> said.
   Inderbitzen said <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>'s unspoiled environment requires
special measures to contain the spill, which is near two areas set
aside for scientific study under terms of the <ORGANIZATION>Antarctic Treaty</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``In warm weather it's easier for plants and even animals to
recover from an accident,'' he said. ``But in <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>, it takes
plants and animals many, many years to recover because of the cold.
It's a very, very fragile environment.''
   The crew has a 35-foot ``skimming boat'' for scooping up spilled
oil and pumping it into floating tanks, and a small tugboat and
inflatable booms to contain drifting oil.
   The cleanup work will be peformed by <ORGANIZATION>Marine Pollution Control
Co.</ORGANIZATION>, under contract to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Navy</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Renirie</PERSON> said.

BID TO CONTAIN ANTARCTIC OIL SPILL STALLED

Foul weather off the tip of <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> forced one Argentine ship 
to abandon its effort to reach a stricken vessel that is leaking oil into the 
pristine waters off <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>, and scientists warned that as winter approaches 
in the <LOCATION>Southern Hemisphere</LOCATION>, storms could soon cut off any hopes of salvaging 
the ship and containing the spill. 
</P>
<P>
"If they don't solve it right away, the winter storms will tear it up," said 
<ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> marine biologist <PERSON>Bill Hamner</PERSON>, who has spent five seasons studying the area 
where the ship ran around <DATE>last Saturday</DATE> just two miles from the <ORGANIZATION>National 
Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Palmer Station</ORGANIZATION>. A second Argentine vessel should arrive in 
the area <DATE>today</DATE>, but it is not clear if that ship is equipped to attempt salvage 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation said that the stricken ship was still afloat despite earlier 
reports that it had sunk. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Hamner</PERSON> and others said the accident could not have happened at a worse time for 
the wildlife in the area, particularly the penguins. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Birds' Insulation in Peril 
</P>
<P>
One of <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>'s largest penguin colonies is in the area, <PERSON>Hamner</PERSON> said, "and 
this is the time when the penguins are fishing most heavily" and young penguins 
are beginning to swim. 
</P>
<P>
That will expose them to the oily water and tar that could destroy the 
insulation system that protects them from the cold temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Hamner</PERSON> said the penguin's feathers trap a layer of air between "the skin and 
the outside, so the birds can swim in ice water, and they are not cold because 
they are beautifully insulated. It probably wouldn't require very much tar to 
break down the insulation and bring cold into direct contact with the body 
core." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Anton L. Inderbitzen</PERSON>, head of the Antarctic staff for the <ORGANIZATION>National Science 
Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, told reporters in <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>, that the greatest concern now is 
that the oil will affect the young birds. 
</P>
<P>
"All the young penguins are just about at the age where they take their first 
swim," he said. "When these birds enter the water for the first time, it could 
be the last time." 
</P>
<P>
There were conflicting reports <DATE>Thursday</DATE> over just how much oil has already 
leaked from the vessel, which is <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> under water but still afloat, according to 
<PERSON>Jack Renirie</PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. The 
<ORGANIZATION>Argentine Ministry of Defense</ORGANIZATION> initially said the leakage from the Argentine 
cruise ship, the <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION>, "really wasn't a significant spill" but later 
conceded some contamination is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Observers in the area radioed to officials in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> that a spill several 
miles long had been sighted. 
</P>
<P>
Any spill in such a pristine area is bound to have a serious local impact, 
although <PERSON>Renirie</PERSON> said the incident was not likely to be as "catastrophic" as 
some reports have indicated. 
</P>
<P>
"This was not a tanker," <PERSON>Renirie</PERSON> said. The ship was carrying about 250,000 
gallons of bunker oil used for its own propulsion system, plus 200 barrels of 
other types of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, large tankers carry many millions of gallons of oil and are 
capable of creating massive oil slicks during accidents. 
</P>
<P>
The temperature in the area is running in the mid-40s, because it is still 
<DATE>summer</DATE> in <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>, but winter is rapidly approaching. Heavy storms could hit 
the area by the end of this month, and by late <DATE>March</DATE> the weather is expected to 
be so foul that little could be done. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Killed Every Animal 
</P>
<P>
When the tanker <LOCATION>Tampico</LOCATION> ran aground near <LOCATION>Ensenada</LOCATION> in <DATE>April, 1957</DATE>, it released 
diesel fuel into the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> said it proved extremely toxic to 
marine life. 
</P>
<P>
"It essentially killed every animal in the area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> experts with 52 tons of cleanup gear arrived in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> aboard a 
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. Air Force</ORGANIZATION> C-5B. From there the experts and their equipment were to be 
loaded aboard the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> research ship Polar Duke for the 600-mile, four-day trip 
to <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
All 316 persons aboard the 435-foot Bahia Paraiso were rescued by other vessels 
in the area.

   An Argentine supply ship that ran
aground off <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> sank <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> in heavy seas and high winds,
the government said, and there was concern oil in its hold could
leak and damage the environment.
   The sinking of the 400-foot <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION> followed warnings from
the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION> that the unspoiled Antarctic
could face ecological disaster if the 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel
aboard the ship were to spill.
   No injuries were reported in the sinking. Tourists aboard and the
crew had been evacuated from the vessel, which was 600 miles south
of <LOCATION>Cape Horn</LOCATION>, the tip of <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>. Salvage efforts had been
hampered by 50 mph winds.
   The double-hulled oceanographic ship sank at about <TIME>10 p.m.</TIME>, the
government news agency <ORGANIZATION>Telam</ORGANIZATION> said, citing a navy communique. Telam
did not say whether the ship broke up or if diesel oil spilled when
it went down.
   The depth of the water in which the ship sank was not immediately
known.
   The ship had been carrying supplies including jet fuel, gasoline
and canisters of compressed gases to the Argentine Esperanza station
near the tip of the <LOCATION>Antarctic Peninsula</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Science
Foundation</ORGANIZATION> said in a statement released in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   The ship ran aground <DATE>Saturday</DATE> about two miles from <LOCATION>Palmer
Station</LOCATION>, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> research facility on the <LOCATION>Antarctic Peninsula</LOCATION>, the
continent's tip. It sustained a 35-foot-long gash in its hull, and
some of the 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel began leaking, washing
ashore near <PERSON>Palmer</PERSON> station.
   The fuel killed some krill, a tiny shrimp-like creature that is a
vital part of the Antarctic food chain, and has affected penguins,
sea gulls and giant petrel birds, the <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION>
statement said.
   There were no immediate details about the extent of damage to the
wildlife in the pristine surroundings.
   Agency spokesman <PERSON>Jack Renerie</PERSON> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> before the ship sank
that the leak, which was threatening penguins and other wildlife,
had stopped.
   ``Scientists are concerned that some research search projects may
already have been affected by the leak,'' a foundation statement
said. It said two Argentine salvage vessels were expected to arrive
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> or <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   Before the sinking, Argentine officials had discounted a spill.
   Telam quoted <ORGANIZATION>Argentine navy</ORGANIZATION> sources as saying: ``The fuel it
carried, both for itself and the Antarctic stations, was in steel
drums so a spill is practically impossible.''
   The 316 people aboard the ship when it ran aground, including 82
passengers and 234 crew members, were rescued by power boats and
taken to <ORGANIZATION>Palmer Station</ORGANIZATION>.
   The passengers and most of the crew were taken by cruise ship to
the <LOCATION>South Shetland Islands</LOCATION>, from which they were airlifted to the
South American mainland <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. But 104 crewmen remain at the
station, said Renerie.
   Because the station is equipped for only 40 people, food has been
rationed to two meals a day, a <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION> statement
said.

   NEW YORK -- Pearson PLC's Penguin USA named two executives
to the top editorial posts at its principal hardcover and
paperback divisions.
   Al Silverman, a vice president and contributing editor of
Penguin USA, was named publisher and editor in chief of the
Viking division, which publishes hardcovers. Mr. Silverman,
65 years old, was chairman and chief executive officer of
Time Warner Inc.'s Book of the Month Club before joining
Penguin in 1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Mr. Silverman</PERSON> succeeds <PERSON>Christine Pevitt</PERSON>, who resigned in
<DATE>June</DATE>. <PERSON>Ms. Pevitt</PERSON> presided over both the hardcover and
paperback divisions, but those duties have now been split.
   <PERSON>Kathryn Court</PERSON>, 43, was named publisher and editor in chief
of Penguin Books, the paperback division. Ms. Court had been
editorial director of Penguin.
   Literary agents and other publishers applauded the
appointments, saying both <PERSON>Mr. Silverman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ms. Court</PERSON> are
known as skilled editors and "book lovers," unlike some
recent management hires in publishing, whose experience was
more financial than literary.
   Also, <ORGANIZATION>Penguin USA</ORGANIZATION> named <PERSON>Arnold Dolin</PERSON>, 63, to the new post
of publisher and editor in chief of Plume Books, the
paperback line in the NAL/Dutton division. <PERSON>Mr. Dolin</PERSON>
continues to serve as associate publisher of NAL/Dutton.
   The appointments follow a period of turbulence at <ORGANIZATION>Penguin
USA</ORGANIZATION>. After a drop in profit in <DATE>1990</DATE>, the publisher shuffled
executives, streamlined its back-office operations, abolished
about 20 jobs and cut back its list of titles by more than
<PERCENT>10%</PERCENT>.
   <PERSON>John F. Moore</PERSON>, recently named president of <ORGANIZATION>Penguin USA</ORGANIZATION>,
said the company's performance has improved considerably. He
said <ORGANIZATION>Penguin USA</ORGANIZATION> had "the best <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE> in the
company's history."

   NEW YORK -- Penguin USA, a publisher that has suffered
declining profits and management turmoil, announced the
departure of the head of its Viking hardcover division along
with a top editor there.
   Christine Pevitt, publisher of the Viking Penguin division
of Penguin USA, whose parent is London-based Pearson PLC,
left "to pursue other interests," the company said. Penguin
insiders cited conflicts between Ms. Pevitt and her two
superiors, Michael Jacobs, Viking Penguin president, and
Peter Mayer, chairman of Penguin USA.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Ms. Pevitt</PERSON>, who had been with the publisher about four
years and took on the top job at Viking about <DATE>18 months ago</DATE>,
couldn't be reached for comment.
   Also departing is senior executive editor <PERSON>Amanda Vaill</PERSON>, 42
years old, a 14-year veteran who has edited such authors as
<ORGANIZATION>Taylor Branch</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Iris Murdoch</PERSON> and <PERSON>T.C. Boyle</PERSON>. Replacements
weren't named for either post.
   In <DATE>1990</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Penguin</ORGANIZATION> reported a <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> drop in world-wide profit.
Like most publishers of trade (general-interest) books,
Penguin's sales have slumped in the recession. In recent
years it also has suffered severe distribution problems, a
rash of complaints from authors about royalty statements, and
problems resulting from the <DATE>1989</DATE> merger of NAL/Dutton, which
included editorial cutbacks.
   Along the way, <ORGANIZATION>Penguin USA</ORGANIZATION> has fired or lost a number of
top managers who still haven't been replaced, including
<PERSON>Morton Mint</PERSON>, who quit as chief executive officer <DATE>last August</DATE>
after 10 months in the job. <PERSON>Marvin Brown</PERSON>, chief
administrative officer, was put in as a replacement "for the
time being," but still serves in that capacity. After two
years, the top editorial post at the Penguin paperback
division still hasn't been filled.
   <PERSON>Mr. Jacobs</PERSON>, who has been president of Viking Penguin for
about a year, called the latest departures "strictly some
personnel moves that are necessary," rather than a plan to
reduce staff levels. He added that "both Viking and Penguin
distinctly need someone to lead them, and I'm looking for
strong editorial leaders. I think this is a great house, but
we can publish books better."
   The publisher will be cutting the number of titles it
publishes by <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> in both hardcover and paperback, said
<PERSON>Mr. Jacobs</PERSON>. Viking publishes about 150 hardcover titles a
year; <ORGANIZATION>Penguin</ORGANIZATION> publishes about 250 paperback titles.
   Referring to perceptions in the publishing industry that
<PERSON>Viking Penguin</PERSON> has been in turmoil and trouble for several
years, <PERSON>Mr. Jacobs</PERSON> said: "I'm tired of hearing about it.
Changing perceptions isn't easy, but the perception of this
house needs to be strengthened. Some people still think we
have distribution problems, for one thing, and they were
solved 18 months ago."

   A <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Air Force</ORGANIZATION> plane carrying tons of
equipment and a team of clean-up experts headed to <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> today
to fight an oil spill that some scientists say could pose a major
environmental threat.
   The huge C-5 plane was bound for the southern city of <LOCATION>Punta
Arenas</LOCATION>, where its cargo and the 15-member team will be transferred
to a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> research vessel, the <ORGANIZATION>Polar Duke</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> said.
   In the Antarctic, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> scientists were trying to catch floating
oil barrels and propane containers near the spill, which was four
miles in diameter and moving to the southwest, the <ORGANIZATION>National Science
Foundation</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The agency said in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> the Argentine supply vessel that
released the oil after it ran aground and sank was carrying 250,000
gallons of diesel fuel. It said an ``incurable disaster'' would
result if all the fuel leaks into the region's unspoiled waters.
   In <PERSON>Buenos Aires</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>Argentine navy</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the spill would
not pose a serious ecological threat.
   A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Chilean navy</ORGANIZATION> agreed. ``The information that
we have is that there is no big spill,'' said Lt. <PERSON>Juan Pablo Barros</PERSON>
in a telephone interview today.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Bahia Paraiso</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Paradise Bay</ORGANIZATION>) ran aground on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> in the
<LOCATION>Bismarck Strait</LOCATION>, 600 miles south of the southern tip of <LOCATION>South
America</LOCATION> and 1{ miles from the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Palmer Research Station</ORGANIZATION> on the
<LOCATION>Antarctic Peninsula</LOCATION>. The ship was carrying supplies for Antarctic
outposts and sightseers.
   All 250 passengers and crew were rescued, but the ship floated
free in heavy seas and sank <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, dropping barrels of oil and
several hundred propane gas containers into the water, said <PERSON>Jack
Talmadge</PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION>.
   Another foundation spokesman in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Jack Renerie</PERSON>, said
most of the oil was in steel drums so the ecological threat may not
be great. However, ``There's a bunch of free (drifting) oil down
there,'' he said. ``The slick has arrived at Palmer Station,'' a
scientific outpost run by the foundation.
   Renerie said personnel at the station had collected some steel
barrels of fuel oil and tanks of compressed gas near the ship.
   ``The latest we have now is that there's probably 150 to 200
barrels (still) in the water,'' <PERSON>Renerie</PERSON> said in a telephone
interview today from <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>. ``And there's still oil coming out of
the ship.''
   He said the ship is about ``80 to <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> underwater'' but
appears to have settled firmly on a shoal.
   ``The water surrounding the ship is covered with a couple of
centimeters (about an inch) of oil. There is a sheen of oil in a
much wider area around the ship, including evidence of oil on the
coastline of the several islands there,'' <PERSON>Talmadge</PERSON> said.
   ``Wildlife has already begun to be affected,'' including krill,
the small crustaceans that form the basis of the Antarctic food
chain, <PERSON>Talmadge</PERSON> said.
   ``Birds which have eaten the krill are showing behavior
differences,'' he said. ``One dead penguin had been found as of a
few hours ago.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> transport left <LOCATION>Norfolk</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and was
to arrive in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> today. <PERSON>Talmadge</PERSON> said its crew and 52 tons of
cargo would reach the accident site by <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   The cargo includes a 35-foot ``skimming boat'' for scooping up
spilled oil and pumping it into floating tanks; a small tugboat;
inflatable booms to contain the spill, and a special truck for
loading and unloading the equipment, said Renerie. He said it was
accompanied by a crew from two private <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> clean-up companies,
<ORGANIZATION>Marine Pollution Control and Global Associates</ORGANIZATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION> is organizing the clean-up
mission with assistance from the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>National
Oceanographic</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Atmospheric Administration</ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
   For two decades scientists
enjoyed a cloistered existence at this <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> research center,
studying wildlife in conditions as unspoiled as anywhere in the
world.
   No longer.
   The mission of <ORGANIZATION>Palmer Station</ORGANIZATION>, perched on a gravelly point
beneath a towering glacier, changed overnight when the Argentine
supply ship <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION> ran aground <DATE>Jan. 28</DATE> and spilled its cargo
of diesel fuel just offshore.
   ``This is changing from a place where people studied untouched
nature long-term to a place where people study the effects of an oil
spill long-term,'' said <PERSON>Margaret Rubega</PERSON>, an ornithologist from <ORGANIZATION>The
University of California-Irvine</ORGANIZATION>. She was studying skuas and kelp
gulls at the station when the wreck occurred.
   ``As an ecosystem that was basically undisturbed, it's a horrible
loss. Really it's tragic,'' <PERSON>Miss Rubega</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>William Fraser</PERSON>, an ornithologist from the Point Reyes (<LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>)
Bird Observatory, said there already are indications of some
poisoning of penguins, skuas, cormorants and other bird species that
populate the rocky islands around the spill.
   ``We have no direct evidence of heavy mortality, but we have
indirect evidence,'' he said.
   Scavanging giant petrels who live on the rocky islands around the
base were feeding their newborn chicks an unusually rich diet of
penguin meat after the spill, <PERSON>Fraser</PERSON> said.
   ``What this means is you had large numbers of penguins dying
locally.''
   In addition, 726 pairs of polar skuas were nesting in the area
when the spill occurred.
   ``Every single one lost their chicks,'' <PERSON>Frazer</PERSON> said.
   He stressed that the evidence was not conclusive. A team of 15
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> scientists has just begun more comprehensive studies.
   Ironically, the site offers an excellent base of information for
a before-and-after examination of a spill. The wealth of data on
bird and marine life collected since the station went into operation
can be used for comparison, <PERSON>Fraser</PERSON> said.
   ``It's a terrible disaster, but it's an incredible natural
experiment.''

   An Argentine ship which ran aground off the
<LOCATION>Antarctic Peninsula</LOCATION> has floated free, and a leak of diesel fuel that
was threatening penguins and other wildlife has stopped, <ORGANIZATION>National
Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Jack Renerie</PERSON> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   But the ship, from which all passengers and crew members have
been evacuated, is in danger of sinking.
   Renerie said the vessel is taking on water, is down at the stern
where water is up to the first deck, and is heeled over 25 degrees.
   Two Argentine vessels were headed to the vessel to try to pump
the remaining fuel from the ship and salvage it if possible, but it
remained in danger of sinking and had drifted against a nearby
island, he said.
   In <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, the government news agency <ORGANIZATION>Telam</ORGANIZATION> reported that the
ship, the <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION>, would probably be towed to <PERSON>Rio Gallegos</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> to be repaired.
   Telam quoted <ORGANIZATION>Argentine navy</ORGANIZATION> sources as saying: ``The fuel it
carried, both for itself and the Antarctic stations, was in steel
drums so a spill is practically impossible.''
   The ship, a 400-foot-long double-hulled vessel, ran aground
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> about two miles from <LOCATION>Palmer Station</LOCATION>, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> research
facility which is located about 600 miles south of <LOCATION>Cape Horn</LOCATION>, the
tip of <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>.
   The 316 people aboard, including 82 passengers and 234 crew
members, were rescued by power boats and taken to <ORGANIZATION>Palmer Station</ORGANIZATION>.
The passengers and most of the crew were taken by cruise ship to the
<LOCATION>South Shetland Islands</LOCATION>, from which they were airlifted to the South
American mainland <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. But 104 crewmen remain at the station,
said Renerie.
   Because the station is equipped for only 40 people, food has been
rationed to two meals a day, said a <ORGANIZATION>NSF</ORGANIZATION> statement.
   The crewmen will remain until the two Argentine salvage vessels
are expected arrive <DATE>Thursday</DATE> or <DATE>Friday</DATE>, the statement said.
   The ship sustained a 35-foot-long gash in its hull, and some of
the 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel began leaking, washing ashore
near <PERSON>Palmer</PERSON> station.
   The fuel killed some krill, a tiny shrimp-like creature that is a
vital part of the Antarctic food chain, and has affected penguins,
sea gulls and giant petrel birds, the statement said.
   There were no immediate details about the extent of damage to the
wildlife in the pristine surroundings.
   ``Scientists are concerned that some research search projects may
already have been affected by the leak,'' the <ORGANIZATION>NSF</ORGANIZATION> statement said.
   The ship was carrying supplies including jet fuel, gasoline and
canisters of compressed gases to the Argentine Esperanza station
near the tip of the <LOCATION>Antarctic Peninsula</LOCATION>, it said.

   And station workers said only fair weather prevented a disaster.
They said most of the <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION>'s lifeboats were open,
inflatable rafts without oars or motors. The day was calm and they
could be towed ashore by station workboats without difficulty. But
they could have overturned or been blown out to sea if the volatile
Antarctic weather had taken a turn for the worse, the workers said.
   In response to the diesel spill, the <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION>
dispatched navy and civilian pollution control experts with 52 tons
of specialized equipment. The mission cost more than <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY>. The
Chilean and Argentine navies also sent costly clean-up missions.
   The clean-up ended in mid-March, although the <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION> still
holds about 63,000 gallons that can't be safely reached and pumped
out. It could spill if the ship breaks up in a winter storm or
simply seep out for many months as the wreck gradually
disintegrates. Experts say it would be too costly to haul the wreck
away.
   The area of the spill teems with wildlife, including penguins,
skuas, cormorants, Arctic terns and other birds. Seals and whales
frequently pass through the bay.
   Scientists say there already exists indirect evidence that many
penguins and other birds were poisoned by the spill, but they have
been unable to determine the extent of the damage. A special team of
15 researchers from the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> has
arrived to begin a comprehensive study on the spill's environmental
impact. It will take years to complete.
   Yet there is no way a claim for damages can be made. Since the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has no property rights to the area at or around <LOCATION>Palmer
Station</LOCATION>, it has no legal grounds for seeking compensation. The area
of the accident, on the <LOCATION>Antarctic Peninsula</LOCATION>, is claimed by <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION>.
   Chile recently announced plans to propose, at the next <ORGANIZATION>Antarctic
Treaty</ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> in <DATE>October</DATE>, an article to hold each country
financially responsible for environmental or other damage. The
<ORGANIZATION>Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION> plans to press for agreement on cost sharing in
clean-up of spills and other accidents, and for formation of an
international coordinating office for emergencies.
   But there could be some opposition.
   ``We must act with prudence, without falling into decisions that
could be a little hasty,'' said <PERSON>Roberto Daverede</PERSON>, head of Antarctic
affairs for the <ORGANIZATION>Argentine Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> claims a thick
wedge of the continent and, like the other claimant nations, rejects
any foreign or international jurisdiction.
   Daverede played down the effects of the <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION> spill.
   ``This is far from being a natural catastrophe,'' he said. He
called the wreck ``an isolated incident.''
   Nonetheless, less than a month after the <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION> accident a
Peruvian research ship ran aground 300 miles away, near <LOCATION>King George
Island</LOCATION>. The vessel, called the Humboldt and touted as the flagship
of <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>'s territorial claim, also spilled some diesel fuel but was
soon refloated.
   By world standards neither accident would qualify as a major
environmental disaster.
   ``I've walked away from bigger diesel spills than this where
nothing died, absolutely nothing,'' said <PERSON>Jim O'Brien</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Gretna</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>La.</LOCATION>,
a pollution control expert hired by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government for the
<LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION> clean-up.
   But there is special concern that <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>'s environment may be
especially fragile. There's also a growing belief that its huge cold
mass plays a key role in long-term global weather patterns.
   There also are some indications that the strain on the local
environment may be straining political relations.
   For decades, a unique spirit of international friendship and
cooperation has reigned in <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>. Political conficts were left
at the doorstep, and missions from such idealogically distinct
countries as the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and right-wing <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> lived as
next-door neighbors, sharing supplies, equipment and a drink or two
on the cold nights.
   In early <DATE>March</DATE>, however, the Chileans criticized what they called
the poor waste handling at the Soviet Bellinghousen base, literally
a stone's from their own <PERSON>Marsh</PERSON> base on <LOCATION>King George Island</LOCATION>. They said
they would file a complaint at the next treaty meeting.

<HEAD>Call Out For U.S. Regulation of Its Burgeoning Antarctica Tour
Industry</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM R. CORMIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> tour operators are planning to send a
record 4,000 or more travelers to <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>, prompting calls for
strict government regulation to protect penguins, other wildlife
and the very fate of the frozen continent.
   ``The number of tourists visiting <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> has more than
tripled in the past five years,'' said <PERSON>Bruce Manheim</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>
activist of the <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Defense Fund</ORGANIZATION> who calls existing
controls inadequate.
   <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> has become a ``hot'' travel destination for the
<DATE>1990s</DATE>, beckoning older Americans seeking more adventure than <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>
and hoping to see a fragile frontierland visited by only a
privileged few in their youth.
   They are fueling fresh growth in the adventure travel industry,
an estimated <MONEY>$1.3 billion-a-year</MONEY> phenomenon.
   About 800 American tourists traveled to <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> in <DATE>1988</DATE>,
3,000 in <DATE>1989</DATE>, and tour operators expect at least 4,000 in the
<DATE>December-February summer</DATE> season. Manheim says it could reach 5,000.
   ``There's clearly a trend toward these type of expeditionary
visits to remote places in the world,'' said <PERSON>Manheim</PERSON>.
   He filed an appeal <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> with the government urging more
regulation.
   ``We are not trying to prohibit tourists from going to
<LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>, we just think tourism is something that has to be
regulated carefully,'' he said.
   Concern began mounting after the <DATE>January 1989</DATE> grounding of the
Argentine naval ship <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION> in which an estimated 175,000
gallons leaked into marine habitats, killing seals, penguins and
other marine life. The vessel remains at the site off <LOCATION>Palmer
Station</LOCATION> with some oil in its tanks.
   Particularly worrisome to critics are the plans of <ORGANIZATION>Ocean Cruise
Lines</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Fort Lauderdale</LOCATION> to send the largest cruise ship in years
to <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>, the 460-passenger <ORGANIZATION>Ocean Princess</ORGANIZATION>.
   Rates begin at <MONEY>$3,895</MONEY> per person for a double-occupancy cabin on
its three wine-and-caviar cruises, which are selling briskly. The
first round trip from <PERSON>Buenos Aires</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, begins <DATE>Dec. 22</DATE>.
   Manheim's appeal is urging the government to place strict
controls on helicopter flights near wildlife sites, guidelines on
tourist observation of penguins and seals, and coordination of
cruise ship visits to breeding grounds.
   He said ships had made repeated tourist visits to the same
wildlife sites, disrupting the breeding of seals, penguins and
other birds.
   ``A year after <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>'s most significant environmental
disaster, we still don't have regulations to prevent similar
catastrophes,'' said <PERSON>Manheim</PERSON>.
   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government responds that effective regulations are
already in place.
   ``We have tried, and we believed we have dealt succesfully with
the explosion of <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> tourism,'' said <PERSON>Jack Talmadge</PERSON> of the
<ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, which regulates <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> activities in
<LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Talmadge</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>NSF</ORGANIZATION> has issued tourist regulations,
established a mechanism for assessing fines for violations and
taken steps to limit visits to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> research stations.
   He said the tour operators are also cooperating with the <ORGANIZATION>NSF</ORGANIZATION> to
minimize the impact of tourism, including giving advance notice of
ship visits.
   Although 16 nations fly flags in <LOCATION>Antactica</LOCATION> and seven claim
slices of it, no nation holds title to the continent, which is
larger than the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> combined.
   Military flights and small ships carrying about 100 tourists
have been frequent modes of travel to <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> since the first
tourists visited in <DATE>1958</DATE>.
   Now, the Chilean government has opened a spartan hotel at its
<ORGANIZATION>Teniente Marsh Station on King George</ORGANIZATION> island, and <ORGANIZATION>LanChile</ORGANIZATION> airlines
began commercial flights to that Antarctic stop last year.
   Australian entrepreneurs have proposed a five-story hotel,
airstrip and hovercraft dock. The Canada-based Adventure Network
currently flies tourists to one <LOCATION>South Pole</LOCATION> station.
   But the bulk of the tourists are Americans brought in by
U.S.-based operators. Conservationists say the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> should
therefore take the lead in adopting a model regulatory policy.
   ``<LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> tourism originates almost exclusively in the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>, and therefore we have the responsibility to regulate our
tourism if we are to push for regulation at an international
level,'' said <PERSON>Manheim</PERSON>.
   Operators of the <ORGANIZATION>Ocean Cruise Lines</ORGANIZATION> said there is no cause for
alarm.
   ``The tourist visiting <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> is a determined
environmentalist, an avid lover of wildlife, and I can assure you
that no tourist _ not one _ has hurt or killed a bird or animal,''
said <PERSON>Lars Eric Lindblad</PERSON>, an Antarctic travel pioneer who will
lecture aboard the <ORGANIZATION>Ocean Princess</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>James Barnes</PERSON>, with Friends of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, concludes
that the travelers may leave their footprints, but they often
return home more committed environmentalists _ ``Ambassadors of
<LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>.''
   Nonetheless, he said, ``The scale of these activities is growing
at such a pace that it does provide cause for concern.''

<TEXT>
   A multimillion-dollar
international cleanup effort is concluding at the site of a wrecked
Argentine supply ship that still holds about 63,000 gallons of
diesel fuel, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Argentine officials said.
   The authorities interviewed this week said little more could be
done with the half-sunken ship, the <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION>, before the
Antarctic winter sets in.
   ``The mission is practically completed,'' said Capt. <PERSON>Heberto
Rubatino</PERSON>, head of the Argentine navy's anti-pollution office. ``We
are sure we have checked out, cleaned up and controlled all of the
<LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION>'s tanks.''
   Rubatino, in a meeting with <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> authorities aboard an Argentine
navy cargo ship anchored near the site, said some of the <LOCATION>Bahia
Paraiso</LOCATION>'s fuel storage tanks could not be reached safely by divers
to pump them out. He said they had been sealed.
   A <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> navy salvage expert, <PERSON>William Walker</PERSON>, said the ship still
held about 63,000 gallons of diesel fuel. He agreed the fuel was
unreachable.
   He said the vessel had been carrying about 265,000 gallons of
diesel fuel when it ran aground <DATE>Jan. 28</DATE> on shoals about two miles
from <LOCATION>Palmer Station</LOCATION>, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> research base on the <LOCATION>Antarctic Peninsula</LOCATION>
about 600 miles from the tip of <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>.
   The <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION> rolled over and partially sank three days after
it ran aground. It is on its side, and part of its gashed orange
hull and its deck remain above the water line. The waters
immediately around the wreck are discolored and smell of fuel.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> sent teams and equipment
to the site. <PERSON>Walker</PERSON> said about 16,400 gallons of fuel was pumped out
of the wreck, after hundreds of thousands of gallons leaked out.
   Walker also said any effort to salvage the vessel, or to cut it
up and remove it from the site, would take three years and cost as
much as <MONEY>$60 million</MONEY> _ far more than the ship's value. Any decision
on whether to salvage the vessel would have to be made by Argentine
authorities, he said.
   <PERSON>Peter Wilkniss</PERSON>, polar programs director for the <ORGANIZATION>National Science
Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, said clean-up efforts by Argentine and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> experts
would conclude about <DATE>March 15</DATE>. He said scientists from the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> was being sent to <ORGANIZATION>Palmer Station</ORGANIZATION> to
study the spill's effects on the area's wildlife. The foundation
supervises all <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> activities in <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>.
   He said the diesel still in the ship's tanks was expected to
continue to leak, ``maybe for as long as a year.'' Some floating
containment booms would be placed to try to control the leakage.
   ``There's little more we can do before <DATE>winter</DATE> sets in,'' he said.
   ``The best thing that could happen, as cruel as it sounds, is for
it (the ship) to break up and spill its guts all at once,'' he said.
This would bring contamination to a quicker end and allow the
wildlife to recuperate, he said.
   Wilkniss said, however, that experts were unable to predict
whether the ship would break up in a big storm or slowly rust
through.
   The Palmer Station area abounds with wildlife, including penguins
and seals. Scientists say they have found many dead seabirds,
including skuas and cormorants, and a few dead penguins, but are
unable to say for certain if pollution was to blame.
   Pollution experts say diesel fuel, because of its high
volatility, evaporates quickly and is less damaging to wildlife than
thicker petroleum products.
   On <DATE>Feb. 26</DATE>, a Peruvian research ship, the <LOCATION>Humboldt</LOCATION>, ran aground
in <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> near <LOCATION>King George Island</LOCATION>, 300 miles from <LOCATION>Palmer
Station</LOCATION>. Authorities said the Humboldt spilled a small amount of
fuel that was treated by the Chilean navy with chemical dispersants.
The ship was refloated <DATE>March 6</DATE>.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An environmental group on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> urged the
government to protect penguins and other Antarctic wildlife by
regulating companies that take tourists to that ice-bound continent.
   ``Repeated tourist visits will cause animals to abandon their
breeding sites or increase the vulnerability of their eggs and
young to predation,'' Environmental Defense Fund attorney <PERSON>Bruce
Manheim</PERSON> said in a statement.
   The New York-based group issued a report calling on the <ORGANIZATION>National
Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> to
establish a licensing system to ensure no damage to <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> from
tour groups.
   ``Although remote and generally inhospitable, <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> is now
visited by thousands of tourists each year who wish to see the
continent's pristine environment before it could be despoiled,''
the report said.
   It said ``most tourists are seriously concerned about protecting
<LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>'' but ``their visits are often localized repetitive and
frequently occur at breeding grounds for penguins, seals and other
seabirds.''
   The report said ``frequent helicopter visits by the first
tourists to <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> _ diplomats and dignitaries visiting <LOCATION>McMurdo</LOCATION>
Station _ quickly resulted in a <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> reduction in the
southernmost <LOCATION>Adelie Penguin</LOCATION> rookery at <LOCATION>Cape Royds</LOCATION>.''
   It said Antarctic tourism is growing and one Australian company
hopes to develop and a hard-surface runway and luxury hotel on the
continent.
   Currently, however, most of the tour companies are American and
thus the federal government could do much to limit environmental
damage, it said.
   The group urged a ban on aircraft overflights within 1,500
meters of wildlife sites, guidelines on government observation of
wildlife, management plans for wildlife sites, advance information
requirements for expeditions, and coordination of tour visits to
wildlife areas.
   It also called for a monitoring program to assess the impact of
such visits, a ban on the disposal of oil, plastics and garbage
from tour vessels and strict regulation of vessel operations in
waters off <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>.
   The report was released on the first anniversary of the
grounding of the <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION>, an Argentine tour vessel that
spilled more than 180,000 gallons of oil into wildlife breeding
areas, the report said. ``A year after <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>'s most
significant environmental disaster, we still don't have regulations
to prevent similar catastrophes,'' it said.

<HEAD>Research Indicates Depletion of Ozone Could Threaten Food Supply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A veteran Antarctic researcher announced
findings <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> indicating that the depletion of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s ozone
layer could threaten the world's food supply.
   Professor <ORGANIZATION>Sayed El-Sayed of Texas A&amp;M University</ORGANIZATION> said increased
amounts of ultraviolet light, which a thinner ozone shield permits
through to the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s surface, supresses biological activity in
microscopic marine plants in the Antarctic.
   El-Sayed said his findings, the first of their kind, confirm
strong suspicions of biologists that ultraviolet light might mean
trouble for fish, animal and other life in the southernmost part of
the world.
   On the other hand, ``I never underestimate the resilency of
nature,'' he said.
   El-Sayed said it is impossible now to say whether the plankton _
microscopic single-celled organisms called ``the grass of the sea''
_ and the organisms that feed on them might adapt to increased
ultraviolet radiation, and much work remains to be done.
   Plankton and the tiny shrimp-like creature called krill that
feed on them are the primary food source for the whole web of life
in the Antarctic, including fish, penguins and whales. A baleen
whale may eat three tons a day.
   ``If anything happened to the krill population, the whole
ecosystem probably would collapse, and you can say goodbye to the
whales and the penguins and the seals and the fish,'' El-Sayed told
reporters at briefing arranged by the <ORGANIZATION>World Resources Institute</ORGANIZATION>, a
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> environmental research organization.
   Several nations are studying plans to harvest krill, a
550-million to 770-million ton reservoir of protein. A <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT>
annual harvest would almost equal the current world fish catch.
   The ozone shield over <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> already thins greatly in
springtime, with the depletion reaching a record <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> last
year. Scientists attribute the destruction of ozone to man-made
chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION> estimates that a <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT>
drop in ozone means a <PERCENT>2 percent</PERCENT> increase in ultraviolet light and a
<PERCENT>4.8 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>7.5 percent</PERCENT> increase in the most common skin cancers.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>March 15</DATE>
said a depletion of ozone at mid-latitudes of the <ORGANIZATION>Northern
Hemisphere</ORGANIZATION> since <DATE>1969</DATE> was in all likelihood the result of those
chemicals. The <ORGANIZATION>Du Pont Co.</ORGANIZATION> said last week it plans to stop making
them.
   <ORGANIZATION>EPA</ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON>Lee M. Thomas</PERSON> told reporters over lunch
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that the <ORGANIZATION>EPA</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> would try to speed up the first
scientific review under last fall's treaty by 31 nations calling
for a cut in <ORGANIZATION>CFC</ORGANIZATION> production by <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> by <DATE>1998</DATE>.
   Thomas said he would not support bills in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, subject of
a hearing <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, calling for an early <PERCENT>95 percent</PERCENT> cut in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
production.
   A <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> cut beyond international agreement might take the
pressure off other CFC-producing countries to act further, <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>
said, and would add little to ozone protection.
   Sayed, a biological oceanographer, was supported in his work
<DATE>last fall</DATE> on <LOCATION>Anvers Island</LOCATION> near <LOCATION>Palmer Station</LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION>National
Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION>. He and the foundation wanted to see if he could
extend earlier German findings that decreases in ultraviolet
enhance plankton growth.

<HEAD>Oil Slick Skimmed From Antarctic Waters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> clean-up team has begun to skim up
fuel oil that has threatened wildlife since it leaked into Antarctic
waters from a grounded Argentine supply ship late last month,
officials said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   Chilean divers also worked to patch the vessel's leaky hull, the
officials said.
   A 35-foot skimming boat rushed down from the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> began
cleaning up <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, according to officials of the <ORGANIZATION>Chilean navy</ORGANIZATION> and
the <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   A navy communique issued in <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> said the boat skimmed the
waters near a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> research base, <ORGANIZATION>Palmer Station</ORGANIZATION>. ``There is a
notable reduction of contaminant in the water,'' it said.
   Authorities also planned to use the special craft inside a ring
of floating booms set up <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by the Chilean navy to contain oil
around the leaking, nearly-sunken <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION>, the Argentine
research and supply ship.
   The <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION>, carrying more than 800 tons of fuel oil, ran
aground <DATE>Jan. 28</DATE> on shoals about two miles from <LOCATION>Palmer Station</LOCATION> and
about 590 miles from the tip of <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>.
   The oil has been slowly leaking, creating a slick two miles long
and threatening the frozen continent's pristine enviroment and
exotic wildlife. An estimated 29,000 thousands penguins nest in the
area.
   But <PERSON>Jack Renerie</PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>National Science

   NEW YORK -- Penguin USA, a unit of London-based Pearson
PLC, announced the resignation of Morton Mint, chief
executive officer. Mr. Mint has only been in the post since
late October, after years of running Penguin's operations in
Canada.
   The resignation was abrupt and shocked the publishing
community. Mr. Morton couldn't be reached for comment, nor
was Peter Mayer, executive chairman of Penguin USA,
available. The company released a statement that said the two
executives had "policy differences with respect to management
of the company in the future."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Penguin named <PERSON>Marvin Brown</PERSON>, chief administrative officer,
to the chief executive post "for the time being." The company
said <ORGANIZATION>Penguin USA</ORGANIZATION> will move toward more decentralization
within the company, with each of the adult divisions having
its own president as well as publisher.
   Penguin has been one of a number of publishing houses
experiencing turmoil in the past year after a time of rapid
growth by acquisition. Last fall, Penguin closed the adult
publishing division of <PERSON>E.P. Dutton</PERSON>, firing a number of
editors in what many in publishing felt was an insensitive
and abrupt manner.

SCIENTISTS TO STUDY KRILL IN ANTARCTICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists know that antarctic krill, 2 1/2-inch-long shrimplike creatures, are 
crucial in the food chain that sustains life in the undersea world of 
<LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>. Krill are a staple for a wide range of antarctic creatures, 
including whales, seals, penguins and a host of other sea birds and fish. 
</P>
<P>
But scientists do not know what will happen to the antarctic food chain as 
krill are increasingly harvested for human and livestock consumption. Nearly 
half a dozen countries, including the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION>, harvest 
krill, using new technology that makes it easier to pull the creatures from the 
ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, it is krill -- and their relationship to the rest of the 
antarctic world -- that scientists aboard the <ORGANIZATION>National Oceanic</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Atmospheric 
Administration</ORGANIZATION> research vessel Surveyor will study during a five-month voyage. 
The Surveyor is scheduled to cast off from <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>'s 10th Avenue Terminal 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Three local scientists associated with the <ORGANIZATION>National Marine Fisheries Service</ORGANIZATION>'s 
<ORGANIZATION>Southwest Fisheries Center</ORGANIZATION> in La Jolla will be among the Surveyor's dozen 
researchers. They are <PERSON>Izadore Barrett</PERSON>, director of science and research, and 
<PERSON>Roger Hewitt</PERSON> and <PERSON>Rennie Holt</PERSON>, marine biologists. Holt is also program manager 
of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Antarctic Marine Living Resources</ORGANIZATION> program. 
</P>
<P>
It will take the Surveyor a month to reach <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> and another month to 
return. Most of the scientists will fly there to meet the ship. 
</P>
<P>
Data gathered during the three-month research effort will be turned over to the 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> delegate to the Convention of the <ORGANIZATION>Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living 
Resources</ORGANIZATION>. The convention is connected with the <DATE>1961</DATE> international <ORGANIZATION>Antarctic 
Treaty</ORGANIZATION>, in which a group of nations agreed to use <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> for peaceful, 
scientific exploration. 
</P>
<P>
"The management of antarctic krill fisheries should include not only how much 
krill can be taken, but more importantly, where it can be taken," <PERSON>Holt</PERSON> said. 
"This is because heavy areas of krill concentrations are also home to vast 
numbers of the animals dependent on krill for survival." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, <PERSON>Holt</PERSON> said, these same areas are the main target of krill 
fishermen. "Harvest of these krill . . . could impact the other animals as 
well," he said. A growing international fleet of krill-harvesting vessels is 
being drawn to <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>, where scientists have observed "super swarms" of 
krill that cover many square miles of ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists on board the Surveyor will use state-of-the-art equipment to measure 
krill populations. They hope to chart known krill populations in order to 
determine how krill harvesting affects the ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
Besides studying krill, Surveyor scientists will study the feeding habits of 
fur seals and penguins, species that consume large quantities of krill. They 
also will study the microscopic algae and plants that krill feed on.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Travel: Warmed by the glories of the frozen continent -
Antarctica fires Nicholas Woodsworth's imagination

<TEXT>
0748 hrs: arrive Cuverville Is. Position: Latitude 64 degs 41 mins <LOCATION>South /
Longitude</LOCATION> 62 degs. 37 mins <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>. Weather: Cloudy, 985 millibars. Temp: 2.50
air, - 0.50 sea. Wind: SW 4-5, sea calm.
Vessel drifting off NE of Cuverville Is. Gentoo penguins, fur seals and 3
humpback whales.
There is no getting around it - <PERSON>Peter Skog</PERSON>, chief officer and keeper of the
Explorer's log, will never be a Conrad. Is it his Swedish phlegm and
unflappability? Is this the new marine minimalism of the <DATE>1990s</DATE>? Or is there
simply not enough space to wax lyrical in each entry? One way or another,
Chief Officer Skog's prose style fails to do full justice to the Antarctic.
Here we are, 75 fully-grown adults, all dressed identically in wellies and
bright red parkas, full of hot breakfast and ready to go - as excited as
six-year-olds on a school outing. And how does the chief officer record the
moment? He makes a landing on a penguin-teeming, whale-surrounded,
ice-berg-jammed antarctic island sound as thrilling as stepping off the No
38 bus on to the <LOCATION>Edgware Road</LOCATION>. Each time I wander up to the bridge to peek
at the log a new literary disappointment awaits me.
One dreads to think what calamity it would take to move him to passionate
language - a giant tidal wave or a biblical parting of the waters might just
do the trick.
Rough sea and heavy swell, vessel pitching and rolling he wrote in the log
two days ago as we crossed the notorious <ORGANIZATION>Drake Passage</ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION>Cape Horn</LOCATION> to the
<LOCATION>Antarctic Peninsula</LOCATION>. Good Heavens, in my cabin pitching and rolling was the
least of it - all night long shoes, books, cameras, sets of drawers and
anything else left unsecured whizzed back and forth between cabin door and
porthole like things possessed. Not even the toilet paper was left in peace
 -somehow an entire roll managed to unwind itself on to the floor in my
cabin bathroom.
Next morning, still in the heaving Passage, the dining room looked like the
charge of the Light Brigade. Others may praise <PERSON>Drake</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Darwin</PERSON>,
all, admittedly, fine sailors of these fearful southern seas. But I praise
<PERSON>Alex</PERSON>, our Filipino waiter, who with a loaded tray can make his way from a
crashing galley across a bucketing floor to a pitching table, all without
spilling a drop.
But will Skog record that in the log? No. Neither will he note that <PERSON>Alex</PERSON> is
one of the few people on earth to have had his appendix removed in an
emergency operation at an antarctic research station. Nor that he never
forgets the Tabasco sauce. Are these not all exceptional feats deserving of
record? In my honour roll of antarctic heroes, <PERSON>Alex</PERSON> stands somewhere near
the top.
Sea temperature -0.50 <PERSON>Skog</PERSON> has written in his passionless, dry-as-dust
Nordic hand. Where does he mention that just yesterday some of the more
adventurous souls aboard the Explorer, my own brave self included, went
swimming in these frigid antarctic waters? Granted, it was Skog, and not I,
who knew the secret of volcanic <ORGANIZATION>Pendulum Cove</ORGANIZATION> and its sand beach,
geo-thermally heated from below. But where does he describe the great
steaming and billowing, sloshing and wallowing that followed our landing?
Skog might not be impressed, but I was. <ORGANIZATION>Pendulum Cove</ORGANIZATION> gave me a better bath
than I can get from my miserable little hot water geyser in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
Gentoo penguins, fur seals and 3 humpback whales, writes <PERSON>Skog</PERSON>, as if
compiling a shopping list for <ORGANIZATION>Sainsbury</ORGANIZATION>'s supermarket. But I can tell you
that meeting these creatures face to face has nothing to do with buying
pesto sauce or coffee beans.
In the first place, pesto and coffee smell good; colonies of antarctic birds
and mammals do not. Conrad himself would have trouble with the smell of a
penguin colony - it is indescribable, but can knock you over at 50 yards.
Guano aside, though, penguins have great attraction - they are cute and
cuddly, curious and comic, and in their nesting thousands, wholly
fascinating. In their black and white outfits they look much like French
waiters, but are far more approachable.
Seals are even more impressive - their smell can knock you over at 200
yards. And in some ways they are even more like humans than penguins - a
contented, smelly and sociable herd of one-tonne elephant seal bachelors
lying together in a steaming sea-side wallow puts me in mind of a post-match
rugby-team locker room. And what about those cocky, argumentative,
testosterone-driven male fur seals who spend much of their time vying for
the favour of the females? Wind, waves, ice and water aside, I might be in
my favourite local on a busy <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
But like most passengers on the Explorer, I reserve my greatest interest for
the whales. Skog can write 3 humpback whales and let it go at that if he
likes. When you are in a Zodiac inflatable dingy and close enough to be
drenched in the fine spray from a whale's blow-hole it is rather a different
matter. There is nothing quite like the company of these vast animals as
they lazily dive and spout and roll and wave their flippers and raise their
flukes. Melville wrote hundreds of pages about the great drama between men
and whales; you would think the miserable Skog might manage more than three
words. But no.
<DATE>1145</DATE> hrs: arrive <ORGANIZATION>Neumeyer Channel</ORGANIZATION>. Position: a spectacular channel, narrow
and high sided, grander than any northern fjord. Weather: marvellous -
crystal clear air, gloriously sunny, fresh and bracing - the kind of weather
that makes you feel happy to be alive. Sea: full of blue curacao-coloured
icebergs.
Vessel crunching through jig-saw puzzle pack ice, surrounded by snow-covered
mountains plunging steeply to the sea.
Could Skog be be responsible for such a loose and fanciful entry? Of course
not. Skog wrote nothing at this point. I have written it for him. The chief
officer, apparently, does not believe breathtaking beauty worthy of
recording. But while he enjoys measuring millibars, the rest of us enjoyed
gazing out from the upper deck at some of the most astounding scenery we
have ever seen - great ice cliffs, impossibly tall and pointed peaks,
glaciers flowing at infinitesimal speed into the sea, weirdly sculpted
icebergs, seals basking on sun-washed ice-floes.
We were all impressed, and this is saying something, for the passengers
aboards the Explorer - wealthy, well-travelled, and for the most part
American - have high expectations. For my own part, I had no idea that such
a continent existed - in my mind <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> was a bleak, desolate and
lifeless place of little interest. On the contrary, it is now for me a place
of the greatest interest.
1500 hrs: arrive <LOCATION>Port Lockroy</LOCATION>. Position: Lat: 64 degs 52 mins S / Long: 6252
W. Weather: partly cloudy, 982 millibars. Temp. 50 air, 00 sea. Sea calm.
Vessel drifting off <LOCATION>Port Lockroy</LOCATION>. Gentoo penguins, leopard seals.
Back to dull <ORGANIZATION>Skog</ORGANIZATION>'s ditch-water delivery again. Does he never tire? Has he
never stood on the rocks, surrounded by hundreds of clamorsome, roosting
shags, and looked down into the waters of <LOCATION>Port Lockroy</LOCATION> as I did?
How striking it is to watch penguins, slapstick, waddling, inept birds on
land, transform themselves into marvels of dynamic design in the water. With
just one hop from a rock they become agile, graceful creatures, as fast as
torpedoes as they flash about in search of the fish and shrimp-like krill
that is their prey.
One moment of marine game-watching in <LOCATION>Port Lockroy</LOCATION> remains with me: that
instant when, on a drifting ice-floe not five yards distant, a snoozing
leopard seal awoke and yawned, showing me a great mouthful of needle-sharp
teeth, then slipped silently into the water. There is nothing furry or cute
about leopard seals - they can flay a penguin right out of its skin with a
few tosses of their powerful heads. The moment that seal slid below the
surface, the hunters became the hunted.
But does Skog appreciate the thrill of the wild, the vitality of life, the
inevitability of sudden death? Gentoo penguins, leopard seals is all he can
find to write. But then Swedes have always been a squeamish lot when it
comes to high drama. In their country I have seen dairy cows with rubber
bulbs fitted to their horns in order that they cause no undue harm or
excitement. Poor <PERSON>Skog</PERSON>, perhaps he should not be blamed.
2000 hrs: arrive <ORGANIZATION>Paradise Bay</ORGANIZATION>. Position: Lat: 65 degs 42 mins S / Long: 6252
W. Weather: overcast, 984 millibars. Temp: 0.50 air, 00 water.
Vessel drifting off <LOCATION>Paradise Bay</LOCATION>. BBQ, then Zodiac tours, landing on the
Antarctic continent.
All is forgiven] In that last sentence taken from the log <DATE>today</DATE> I detect a
tiny soupcon, the merest hint of understanding, of what it is to be Man the
Explorer. But it is enough. Until now, the fourth of 10 days of cruising, we
have only visited islands lying off the coast of <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>. This evening we
land on the continent itself, and <ORGANIZATION>Skog</ORGANIZATION> has recognised the heroic symbolism
of that act. A literary milestone.
If there is any doubt as to the significance of the event, there is, as the
chief officer notes, to be a magnificent outdoor meal served on the rear
deck, with a penguin - even now being chiselled in ice by a skilled Filipino
chef - as the centrepiece to our blithe, mulled-wine-swilling company.
And if that is not enough, the captain is up on the bridge at this moment
preparing a Certificate of Antarctic Exploration for each of us. We have
'joined the ranks of <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> and <PERSON>Shackleton</PERSON>', it informs us, 'and ventured to
set foot on <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>, the biggest, coldest, driest, windiest, loneliest,
most remote and least-known continent on earth'. Not only that, but we are
now dedicated to 'honour the brave pioneer Antarctic explorers who sailed
these frozen seas before us, and to protect the Antarctic Continent for
those who will follow'.
That is certainly quite a big mouthful for one small step, even if it is on
to <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>. No matter how much the chief officer has loosened up, I am
sure he would not approve of the tone of such a document - could that be why
he has left the captain alone on the bridge and is down here with us
munching BBQ? It is simply not his style.
<PERSON>Nicholas Woodsworth</PERSON> sailed to <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION>Abercrombie</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Kent</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Sloane

There exists a vast, eternally white continent where life clings to the borders 
of death. There the icy air is light to the lungs and offers magical 
transparency to the sight. The hours of bewitching quietness and of total sun 
are swept away by raging blizzards that spare intruders only by chance. 
</P>
<P>
This immense austral land is buried under mountains of snow, piled up and 
frozen over the course of tens of millions of years. Fossils, the vestiges of 
important chapters in our planet's history, sleep under their immaculate 
shroud. All around circles a silent carrousel of giant icebergs that have been 
torn from the shores, and dwarf lichens sprinkle the coast ice with hesitant 
spots of color. A fringe of salty ice protrudes, then disappears with seasons, 
while on land soft ice melts only to better solidify. 
</P>
<P>
The sea sometimes reddens with clouds of tiny shrimp -- krill -- on which 
penguins, whales and, indirectly, seals stuff themselves in order to survive. 
The seals move about under the pack ice while singing eerie melodies; a fish -- 
the icefish -- injects proteins as antifreeze into its colorless blood; the 
orcas, endowed with majestic fins, blend their breath with the morning mist. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>, continent at the bottom of the world, has shown us its fragile 
state, which is due to the extreme simplicity of its ecosystems. But the 
forbidding rigor of its environment did not discourage some territorial claims 
that the <DATE>1959</DATE> Antarctic treaty has thus far managed to include. The document, 
signed by 12 nations and now honored by 26 others, ensures the demilitarization 
of <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> and lays great stress on its use for scientific research. 
</P>
<P>
Already whales have been hunted, and more recent tentative agreements 
(particularly that of <DATE>April 7, 1982</DATE>) have begun opening the way to industrial 
fishing for krill. Such hypocritical infringements on the spirit that 
enthusiastically gave birth to the Antarctic treaty -- namely the willingness 
to preserve the last wilderness zone on our planet -- caused us to sound a 
first cry of alarm in <DATE>1984</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, this time, masks have fallen. Representatives of 33 countries, assembled 
in <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>, have, after six years of difficult negotiations, 
signed an agreement that opens the entire Antarctic continent to a so-called 
controlled exploitation of its mining resources: coal, uranium, gold and oil. 
</P>
<P>
The document even specifies that prospecting by means of seismic explosion of a 
"reasonable magnitude" is permitted. The cold? The ice? It will be difficult? 
It will be costly? What does it matter!? Since it is possible, exult the 
technocrats, it will be done! What? Dust from coal and smoke from oil torches 
are going to alter the protective whiteness of the surface, the albedo of the 
entire continent? The ice may melt; the sea may rise several dozen feet and 
engulf most of our cities? Come, come now! More ecologists' tales! 
</P>
<P>
Hardly. We need only take the example of the <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION>, the Argentine 
supply ship that ran aground in <DATE>January</DATE> off <LOCATION>Palmer Station</LOCATION>, a crucial <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
scientific base. The diesel-fuel cargo leaked slowly, over a matter of days, 
but 20 years of scientific research was compromised before clean-up vessels 
could even reach the spill. 
</P>
<P>
Oil-coated seabirds and smothered plankton -- microscopic sea creatures being 
studied in experiments to gauge how increased ultraviolet sunlight will effect 
the ocean surface. Accidental pollution had finally stained the laboratory of 
<LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>. It was a "minor" oil spill, authorities said, but the local 
consequences to the fragile ecosystem will take years, if ever, to recoup. 
</P>
<P>
If an innocent ship with an innocent purpose can cause potential catastrophe, 
what of mining operations? Are we naive enough to believe that miners will put 
on white coats and brush their feet before they unleash their industrial 
maelstrom? 
</P>
<P>
Citizens of the entire world, be on the alert! The <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION> Agreement is 
nothing more than a holdup on a planetary scale. It involves the smashing open 
of the safe that contains the most fantastic treasure: the last water reserve 
that cannot be controlled if it is set free. The hostages: seals, birds, 
penguins, whales. Threatened is the whole of humankind whose conscience in 
managing the future of our planet risks being sacrificed to the cult of a 
meaningless golden calf. 
</P>
<P>
The scrap of paper signed in <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION> will be applied when 16 of the 20 
voting members of the <DATE>1959</DATE> treaty ratify it. We must at all costs oppose this 
ratification in the name of future generations. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>December, 1972</DATE>, I disembarked from <LOCATION>Calypso</LOCATION> onto <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> for the first 
time. A serene sun shone upon the dusting of snow which had fallen during the 
night. With my heart beating excitedly, I took my first steps. The crackling of 
my boots in the soft powder made me look back. My footprints, soiled with a bit 
of grease, contrasted with the blinding whiteness of everything that surrounded 
me. Naively, I blushed with shame for not having cleaned the soles of my shoes.

<HEAD>Scientists Find Vast Population of Plants, Animals in Polar Ice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A vast and previously undiscovered population
of tiny plants and animals lives in hollowed pores carved through
the sea ice that forms annually around <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>, researchers said
in studies released <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Cornelius Sullivan</PERSON>, co-leader of a <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION>
polar study expedition, said scientists studying the sea ice found
large and thriving populations of krill, a small shrimp-like
animal, grazing on one-celled plants and animals that live in the
ice pores.
   ``The sea ice is a place where for a small expenditure of energy
the krill can avoid predators and live in a rich pastureland,''
said <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON>, the director of marine biological research at the
<ORGANIZATION>University of Southern California</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>.
   Existence of the vast population of plants and animals living in
the ice came as a surprise to researchers who spent 70 days during
the heart of the Antarctic winter studying the polar ice.
   During the <DATE>winter</DATE>, sea water freezes to a six-foot thickness and
forms a pack extending 1,100 miles from the Antarctic mainland. The
total ice formed around the <LOCATION>South Pole</LOCATION> continent is roughly 11
million square miles, three times the area of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   Each <DATE>spring</DATE>, <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of the ice melts, creating a
nutrient-rich layer of water that is filled with small plants and
animals, and with the birds and mammals that feed on them.
   But the amount of life that existed within the ice during the
winter months was an unanticipated discovery, said <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> in a
telephone interview.
   He said the scientists found that the sea ice was not solid, but
was pocked with channels, ``rather like Swiss cheese.'' These
channels form as hairlike pores when the ice freezes and then are
enlarged by wave action, said <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON>.
   Once the channels are in place, they form a home for one-celled
plants called algae that live in the microscopic spaces between the
ice crystals.
   <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said the algae is ``remarkable'' because it is able to
perform photosynthesis in temperatures at or below freezing.
Sunlight strikes the ice five to six hours a day in the <DATE>winter</DATE> and
enough of the light penetrates the ice to allow the algae to grow.
   The ice algae, he said, has adapted to the frigid temperatures
and will ``fall apart'' if allowed to warm to typical room
temperatures.
   Once the algae has bloomed in the ice, <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said, the pores
in the ice surface becomes home to bacteria, protozoans and
amoebas, many of which feed on the algae. The krill, free swimming
from the ocean, then make their way into the channels and feed on
the other small ice creatures.
   Divers, exploring the ice from below, were able to probe the ice
channels and bring out samples of the life there.
   ``Almost all of the krill we found were in larval or juvenile
stages, which gives us the idea that the krill are using the ice as
a giant nursery for early development stages,'' said <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON>.
   Some studies indicate that the ice pack around <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> may be
shrinking because the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> is slowly warming. If this is true,
said <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON>, it could have an impact on krill, which is a key
animal in the polar ecosystem.
   Adult krill live in vast schools and are a favorite food of
whale, penguin and seal.
   ``Krill is a key species that others depend on,'' said <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON>.
A decline in the krill population could affect the populations of
other animals, he said, ``because they are obviously all linked.''

<TEXT>
   King penguins at a rookery on a nearby
island stampeded, killing 7,000 of the birds, and officials said
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> they were investigating the mysterious occurrence.
   ``We don't know at this stage why they stampeded _ we have not
observed this type of behavior before,'' a spokesman for the
<ORGANIZATION>Australian State Parks Wildlife</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Heritage Ministry</ORGANIZATION> said on
condition of anonymity.
   The stampede occurred on <LOCATION>Macquarie Island</LOCATION>, which is midway
between <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> and part of <LOCATION>Tasmania</LOCATION>, an
Australian state.
   The parks spokesman said about 6,000 chicks and 800 to 1,000
adults were found dead about three weeks ago on the island.
   ``There was no one in the area at the time, and we have ruled
out earthquakes,'' he said. ``There is a lot of seismic activity on
<LOCATION>Macquarie Island</LOCATION>, but there was no activity on that day.''
   <LOCATION>Macquarie Island</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Lusitiana Bay</LOCATION> is home to hundreds of
thousands of birds and the site of one of the world's biggest king
penguin rookeries.

   The bodies of 50 endangered
penguins were found floating in the flooded hold of a Taiwanese
fishing trawler that ran aground, environmental officials said.
   The carcasses of the Jackass penguins had been individually
packaged in plastic bags, the officials said <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   The fishing trawler An Hung ran aground on the rocky
southwestern coast of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> early <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, and 15

   The Jackass penguin is unique to the southern African coast and
is protected under South African law. Its population has diminished
after centuries of being hunted.
   Its natural habitat has been diminished by fishing and the
collection of the guano the bird uses to build its nests.

   Man on the frozen continent requires steady supply. The fauna is
all but inedible. Even penguin eggs are too greasy for breakfast.
The plants are minuscule lichens. And what comes in must be carried
out.
   Travelers today find Capt. <PERSON>Robert Falcon Scott</PERSON>'s hut as he left
it in <DATE>1911</DATE>, with unrusted tins of <ORGANIZATION>Huntley &amp; Palmer</ORGANIZATION>'s biscuits lined
up on dust-free shelves. Cold, clean air preserves almost anything.
   Environmentalists rage at garbage dumps that accompany a
lengthening string of military and scientific outposts, including
the sprawling <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> McMurdo Station.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Greenpeace</ORGANIZATION> environmentalist group set up a base near <LOCATION>McMurdo</LOCATION>
to monitor developments. Its members came to blows with French
soldiers building a runway across from a penguin rookery near the
<LOCATION>South Magnetic Pole</LOCATION>.
   The group accuses the Americans, among others, of killing marine
life with sewage and refuse. If scientists cannot protect the
environment, <ORGANIZATION>Greenpeace</ORGANIZATION> argues, oilmen and miners will be worse.
   Near the end of <DATE>September</DATE>, word filtered out that 44,000 gallons
of diesel fuel leaked from a pipe at the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Amundsen-Scott
Station at the <LOCATION>South Pole</LOCATION>. The leak was discovered in <DATE>August</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials said it would seep into the ice with no
environmental damage. But Foreign Minister <PERSON>Gareth Evans</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> called it a perfect example of why <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> had to be
protected.
   In the early <DATE>1970s</DATE>, when politics heated in <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>, claimant
nations hurried to strengthen their positions.
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> leased a Greek ship, with deck chairs but no radar,
for cut-rate tourism. <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> built a hotel. Last year, the first
commercial flights landed at the <LOCATION>South Pole</LOCATION>.
   Now Australian entrepreneurs propose ``Project Oasis'' _ a
runway for 747 jet aircraft, a five-story hotel and a hovercraft
dock.
   When the mineral convention was signed, some specialists argued
that controlled exploitation was better than no accord at all. If
anyone broke the moratorium, no international law would apply.
   Ideas included carrying out oil in submarines, rather than
tankers, to minimize risk.
   But the picture changed in <DATE>January</DATE> when an Argentine supply
ship, the <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION>, nosed into waters marked on charts
``dangerous ledges and channels'' and tore open its double hull.
   The crew and all 81 tourists escaped, but an estimated 170,000
gallons of its 250,000 gallons of fuel oil leaked onto marine
habitats, eventually killing seals, penguins and other marine life.
   Salvage crews were able to stop the leakage but oil still
remains in the ship's tanks.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Argentine navy</ORGANIZATION> reported after a reconnaissance flight over
the area in early <DATE>September</DATE> that the <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION> is still aground
in ice-free waters and listing at about 140 degrees.
   Capt. <PERSON>Raul Pueyrredon</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Argentine navy</ORGANIZATION> said the airmen
``saw no evidence of leakage nor any visible ecological damage.''
   He added that he was not sure how much oil remained in the
vessel but that ``it was very little.''
   In a letter to <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Transportation</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Samuel Skinner</PERSON> in
<DATE>May</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Defense Fund</ORGANIZATION>, an American organization that
describes itself as non-profit, said the <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION> still had
about 70,000 gallons of fuel on board when the <LOCATION>Southern Hemisphere</LOCATION>
winter set in and still poses a threat to <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>'s environment.
   ``<LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>'s worst environmental disaster has become a
forgotten oil spill,'' the letter said.

<HEAD>Antarctic Researcher Says Food System Could Be Wrecked By Ozone</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More ultraviolet light suppresses marine
productivity in the Antarctic, according to findings of new
research on the Antarctic ozone hole.
   Sayed El-Sayed of <ORGANIZATION>Texas A&amp;M University</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> his findings
could mean the existence of a threat to the krill, a tiny
shrimp-like creature on which all Antarctic life depends directly
or indirectly.
   If the krill goes, ``the whole ecosystem probably would
collapse,'' and the whales, seals, penguins, birds and fish would
disappear, he told reporters at a briefing arranged by the <ORGANIZATION>World
Resources Institute</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> environmental policy research
institute that has called attention to ozone problems.
   The ozone layer high above the earth thins by about half over
<LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> each <DATE>spring</DATE>, letting more ultraviolet light reach the
ground. If this happened over the globe as a whole, the
<ORGANIZATION>Environmental Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION> says, each <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> decline in
ozone would mean a <PERCENT>2 percent</PERCENT> increase in ultraviolet radiation and
a <PERCENT>4.8 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>7.5 percent</PERCENT> increase in the most common skin
cancer.
   The krill, which are an inch or two long, feed on phytoplankton,
which are invisible to the naked eye. Fish and marine mammals in
turn feed on the krill.
   A <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> harvest of the 550 million to 770 million tons of
protein represented by the krill could equal the entire fish catch
of the world, and several nations are studying use of such a
protein resource.
   El-Sayed and his students at an island near <LOCATION>Palmer Station</LOCATION>
labeled test tanks of southern ocean water containing
phytoplankton, the ``grass of the sea,'' with radioactive calcium
carbonate.
   The radioactivity of the plankton after taking up the carbon
isotope is a measure of photosynthesis, the process by which plants
live, deriving energy from sunlight.
   Samples to which extra ultraviolet had been added showed far
less radioactivity: 1,000 counts per minute on a scintillation
counter as opposed to 15,000 counts per minute for the sample from
which all ultraviolet had been excluded.
   The extra ultraviolet was about <PERCENT>6.5 percent</PERCENT> of what was already
in the light. On the day the measurements were made, ozone overhead
was only about <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of normal, so the light was already
presumably enriched in ultraviolet.
   Ultraviolet reaching the ground in <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> is not as much as
it would be elsewhere under the same ozone layer. The sun is low in
the sky and its light travels a long slant distance through the
ozone.
   Scientists attribute the Antarctic ozone hole, and a newly
discerned average <PERCENT>2.3 percent</PERCENT> year-round ozone decline in northern
mid-latitudes since <DATE>1969</DATE>, to man-made chemicals called
chlorofluorocarbons. Major producing nations agreed in <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION>
<DATE>last year</DATE> to a <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> cut in production by <DATE>1998</DATE>, and <DATE>last week</DATE>
<ORGANIZATION>du Pont Co.</ORGANIZATION> said it planned to stop manufacture.
   <PERSON>Lee M. Thomas</PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Protection
Agency</ORGANIZATION>, told reporters <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that in light of the mid-latitude
decline, he would seek to accelerate the scientific review called
for by the treaty so that participating nations could consider
further production cuts when <DATE>1990</DATE> opens.
   But <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said he would not support bills in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>,
subject of a hearing today, calling for an early <PERCENT>95 percent</PERCENT> cut in
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> production.
   Sayed, a biological oceanographer with 25 years of experience in
the Antarctic, was supported in his work <DATE>last fall</DATE> on <LOCATION>Anvers Island</LOCATION>
near <LOCATION>Palmer Station</LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Salvaged Cargo Plane Rises From The Ice</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A huge cargo plane
that arose from the Antarctic ice like a frozen phoenix after being
buried in drifts for 16 years returned to its home base <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   ``Today we are celebrating a triumph: a triumph of technology, a
triumph of knowledge and skill, and a triumph of courage,'' <ORGANIZATION>National
Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Jack Talmadge</PERSON> said after the LC-130
Hercules and its nine-member crew landed.
   Lockheed engineers and <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> personnel worked in subfreezing cold,
heavy snow and windstorms for 42 days to excavate the icebound,
40-ton aircraft. The 98-foot-long plane was flown out of the crash
site in <DATE>January 1988</DATE> and was renovated in <LOCATION>Christchurch</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>.
   The LC-130 returned to its hangar at the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Antarctic
Development Squadron 6</ORGANIZATION>, the ``Puckered Penguins'' who fly seven
cargo ships owned by the foundation and used to supply its polar
missions.
   The Hercules was abandoned in <DATE>December 1971</DATE> at a remote site
about 700 miles from <LOCATION>McMurdo Sound</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ice station on the
Antarctic, after an aborted takeoff that damaged its landing ski and
nose.
   The aircraft was designed for use in polar climates and has
one-ton, Teflon-coated ``wheel-skis'' to break the grip of ice on
takeoff.
   The loss of the Hercules hurt the foundation's ability to conduct
field research in <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>, foundation officials have said.
   A salvage crew worked in minus 30-degree temperatures, heavy snow
and 20-knot windstorms to excavate the damaged aircraft, repair it
and fly it out. All but the top 3 feet of the plane's 38-foot-high
tail had been buried in snow.
   The plane was made by <ORGANIZATION>Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co.</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Marietta</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga</LOCATION>. Lockheed engineers involved in the salvage found many
hydraulic and electronics systems still working after the long
hibernation.
   There was still air in the tires and gasoline in the tanks,
apparently preserved by the frigid temperatures and dry polar
climate.
   Foundation officials say about <MONEY>$4.2 million</MONEY> was spent to excavate
and overhaul the plane. The estimated cost of a replacement plane is
<MONEY>$35 million</MONEY>.

ANVERS ISLAND, Antarctica 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The upturned hull of a sunken Argentine tourist ship has nearly slipped from 
sight, barely breaking the surface now like one of the playful whales that swim 
these frigid but plentiful waters. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the somber memories of the wreck last year, and the oil it spilled within 
sight of a premier <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> research station, endure as forceful symbols of the 
hazards posed by the growing human presence in <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 315 tourists and crew of the <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION> survived and the spill 
was minor by most standards, the accident gave new impetus to a movement to 
respect this continent not only as a place of forbidding beauty but also as a 
fragile reservoir ensuring the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s health. 
</P>
<P>
That has meant, in part, cleaning up the unsightly mess that developed in 
recent decades from Antarctic exploration itself. But more broadly, it has 
encouraged a changing mentality toward tourism, research methods and 
exploitation. The broken hulk also has reminded the world of the need to 
preserve <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> as a uniquely shared and still-untainted laboratory for 
understanding the planet's seas and skies. 
</P>
<P>
The 25 nations that make up the Antarctic Treaty organization are working with 
renewed energy on tougher rules to govern activities in the region. And some 
countries are rebelling against an already strict <DATE>1988</DATE> agreement to govern oil 
drilling and mineral mining, arguing instead for an outright ban. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, which runs the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Antarctic program, is 
removing the junk heaps that scar its three permanent bases and is hauling 
shiploads of rubble back north. Even before the <ORGANIZATION>Bahia Paraiso</ORGANIZATION> sank, an 
additional <MONEY>$8.3 million</MONEY> was budgeted for environmental and safety projects this 
year. Cleaner sewer systems are being installed, environmental impact programs 
are under review and emergency plans for oil spills are being drafted. 
</P>
<P>
"For years, <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> was approached in an expeditionary way," said <PERSON>Gary 
Staffo</PERSON>, recently named as the <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION>'s polar safety and 
environmental officer. "It was seen as a one-time shot: 'We'll go do the 
mission and get the people back and leave the trash behind.' Certainly that is 
no longer acceptable -- and that is progress. There are greater expectations 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Bahia Paraiso means <ORGANIZATION>Paradise Bay</ORGANIZATION> in Spanish, and that would have been an apt 
name for the place where the ship foundered on rocks on <DATE>Jan. 28, 1989</DATE>, spilling 
about 150,000 gallons of diesel fuel into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Elephant seals nuzzle noisily on a rocky island beach, adelie and chinstrap 
penguins totter about, tiny limpets browse in the tidal basins and swarms of 
shrimp-like krill bloom in springtime, hearty meals for the whales. 
</P>
<P>
Across the bay, blue-white glacial ice cliffs rise hundreds of feet out of the 
sea. The silence gives way to explosions as vast slabs break away and slide 
into the water -- the "calving" of icebergs from the ice shelf that covers <PERCENT>98%</PERCENT> 
of the continent and is up to three miles thick near the <LOCATION>South Pole</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> is a place for science. In recent years, the research has 
taken on urgency as knowledge emerges of the environmental damage caused by 
industrial-era pollution and its potential impact on the whole planet. 
</P>
<P>
Other projects take advantage of the still-unspoiled seas and skies, with 
constant winter nights and crystal <DATE>summer</DATE> days, to pursue cutting-edge studies 
of phenomena such as cosmic rays and radiation belts. 
</P>
<P>
And some scientists are finding a world startlingly abloom in what seems at 
first such a bleak and lifeless place, fresh proof of the continent's crucial 
role in the world's ecology. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers <PERSON>David Karl</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Hawaii</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Mark Huntley</PERSON> of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Scripps Institution of Oceanography</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>La Jolla</LOCATION>, for example, are charting a 
phenomenal mass of life in the <LOCATION>Gerlache Strait</LOCATION> along the <LOCATION>Antarctic Peninsula</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
From the pitching deck of the primary <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> research ship the <ORGANIZATION>Polar Duke</ORGANIZATION>, Karl 
sends an electronic pulse into the water, setting off a small explosion. That 
frees a titanium frame holding a ring of 13 plastic bottles, and the device 
floats up hundreds of feet to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
All hands scan the choppy waters until <PERSON>Robert H. Rutford</PERSON>, president of the 
<ORGANIZATION>University of Texas</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> and a veteran polar hand, spies the yellow buoys 
astern. The ship's winch painstakingly recovers the experiment. Karl helps pull 
aboard the frame and its harvest: five months' worth of organic sediment, much 
of it excrement from luxuriant swarms of krill shellfish. 
</P>
<P>
The "catch" is neatly divided into 11-day samples captured by the 
computer-driven ring of revolving bottles attached to the bottom of a plastic 
funnel. Some are near empty, but a couple, recording the height of the "bloom," 
are nearly full. 
</P>
<P>
The six-year project, costing <MONEY>$600,000</MONEY> this year, recorded a rise in the 
strait's biomass this <DATE>summer</DATE> "to a higher level than ever found before in any 
ocean," said <PERSON>Karl</PERSON>, who has visited <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> seven times since <DATE>1976</DATE>. "In the 
<DATE>winter</DATE>, this water is essentially a biological desert. But in the <DATE>spring</DATE>, we 
are finding that it blooms into a biological garden." 
</P>
<P>
The study also will help analyze aspects of the "greenhouse effect" of global 
warming, thought to be caused by a steady increase in carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere. As the plant biomass of the <LOCATION>Gerlache Strait</LOCATION> grows and absorbs 
carbon dioxide, that may allow the ocean to absorb more carbon dioxide from the 
atmosphere and, in effect, serve as "a self-regulating mechanism that helps 
keep us from totally ruining the environment," <PERSON>Karl</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Huntley</PERSON>, a partner in the program known as RACER (Research on <ORGANIZATION>Antarctic Coastal 
Ecosystem Rates</ORGANIZATION>), said the project has shown the strait to be 10 times richer 
than the nutrient-filled fishing grounds off <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>, known simply as "The Ice" by old hands, contains <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT> of the world's 
fresh water, and the cold currents welling from its shores are apparently an 
engine for the world's seas. 
</P>
<P>
"What you've got here is a biological pump," <PERSON>Huntley</PERSON> said. "The <LOCATION>Gerlache</LOCATION> is 
seething with life. And if you've got a rich resource like this that depends on 
a small locale, then you'd better be careful with it. It could be an incredibly 
important nursing ground." 
</P>
<P>
In a climate with winter temperatures as low as 128.6 degrees below zero 
Fahrenheit and where psychological tests are required for those who plan to 
"winter over," Ph.D. degrees don't suffice; scientists need ingenuity, 
teamwork, stamina and imagination. 
</P>
<P>
When he sent the frame back to the bottom for another eight-month sampling, 
Karl resorted to an unlikely anchor: an old boiler taken from the junk heap at 
<ORGANIZATION>Palmer Station</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Antarctica is so harsh an environment that it defies the ambitions of any 
single nation, and nowhere in the world has international cooperation been so 
extensive. The RACER program's 23 scientists come from seven nations. 
</P>
<P>
"With colleagues from <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, you get a whole different conceptual 
perspective," <PERSON>Huntley</PERSON> said. "One has the sense of constantly being fertilized. 
. . . A lot of the geopolitical nonsense falls away, and the human aspects 
prevail. The common denominator is scientific research." 
</P>
<P>
That fits the treaty's declaration: "It is in the interest of all mankind that 
<LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> shall continue forever to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes 
and shall not become the scene or object of international discord." 
</P>
<P>
The mean annual temperature in the interior of the continent is 70 degrees 
below zero Fahrenheit. But along the Antarctic Peninsula jutting up toward the 
tip of <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>, the <DATE>summer</DATE> temperatures rise above freezing. That gives 
rise to names like the "Banana Belt" and the "Antarctic Riviera" in a region of 
majestic fiords and, between the outsized glaciers, much of the <PERCENT>2%</PERCENT> of open 
ground not covered by ice on the continent. 
</P>
<P>
The peninsula is just two days by sea across the fearsome <ORGANIZATION>Drake Passage</ORGANIZATION> or a 
two-hour flight aboard a C-130 Hercules to the Chilean airstrip at <ORGANIZATION>Teniente 
Marsh Base</ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION>King George Island</LOCATION>, making it accessible to scientists and a 
steadily growing number of tourists alike. 
</P>
<P>
The island is home to eight permanent research bases and also to the only hotel 
in <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>, run by the Chilean military. Calling it Spartan is generous; the 
hotel looks and feels like an elongated shipping container raised off the 
barren ground beside the gravel landing strip, with a few cubicles off the 
narrow hallway for people boarding ships in the bay for tours or transiting to 
bases farther south. 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION> was among several ships that call at <ORGANIZATION>Palmer Station</ORGANIZATION>, on 
<LOCATION>Anvers Island</LOCATION> halfway down the peninsula. About 2,500 tourists made the trip 
this season, up from 822 in <DATE>1983</DATE>. A couple of tour ships plan to visit <LOCATION>McMurdo 
Station</LOCATION> next year, the largest <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> base, located on the opposite side of the 
continent on the much colder <ORGANIZATION>Ross Sea</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Cross-country skiers, an airborne tour group and a cross-continent dog sled 
expedition have also called at the third <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> base, Amundsen-Scott at the <LOCATION>South 
Pole</LOCATION>, during the <DATE>last two summers</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Groups like the <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Defense Fund</ORGANIZATION> cite the <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION> sinking in 
demanding far stricter rules for tourism, including a ban on helicopter flights 
and boat landings within 1,500 meters (about one mile) of wildlife sites and an 
outright ban of any ship waste disposal in the Antarctic. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, which runs the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Antarctic program, openly 
discourages tourism and last year enacted regulations to control tourist 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Carol A. Roberts</PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION>'s division 
of polar programs, cited three concerns: the impact of tourists on scientific 
work, especially during disruptive visits to the stations; the tourists' impact 
on the environment, underscored by the Argentine shipwreck, and the cost of 
search and rescue. Palmer Station sacrificed most of its research season last 
year to care for the <ORGANIZATION>Bahia Paraiso</ORGANIZATION> survivors and coordinate the cleanup and 
analysis of the spill. 
</P>
<P>
Nascent adventure tourism on the dangerous mainland, she said, threatens to 
cause even greater problems in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, who handles logistics for <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>, noted that the budget for 
getting to and working in the region is greater than the science budget itself. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the last place on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>; it's almost like going to the moon in a 
logistical sense," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The hazards were apparent on a recent trip by scientists setting out on a range 
of expeditions, accompanied by <ORGANIZATION>NSF</ORGANIZATION> staffers evaluating environment and safety 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
The C-130 flight from <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> descended through clouds toward the airstrip in 
35-knot crosswinds, just below the landing limit of 37 knots. The <ORGANIZATION>New York Air 
National Guard</ORGANIZATION> pilot fought to keep the wallowing, yawing plane on course and 
slammed it down on the airstrip. Parked, the plane shuddered in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
A choppy, wet ride aboard rubber Zodiac rafts with outboard motors brought the 
group to the <ORGANIZATION>Polar Duke</ORGANIZATION>, the workhorse <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Antarctic research ship. The 
219-foot, ice-strengthened vessel serves as both transport to <LOCATION>Palmer Station</LOCATION> 
and platform for some of the complex oceanographic studies that form the heart 
of the <ORGANIZATION>NSF</ORGANIZATION>'s <MONEY>$151-million</MONEY> annual Antarctic research program. 
</P>
<P>
The new Norwegian captain, <PERSON>Tor-Arne Jakobsen</PERSON>, brought the ship into <DATE>Palmer two 
days later</DATE> on a stormy night in a punishing 45-knot wind, down from the 
66-knot, hurricane-force winds the previous day at the base. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of the approximately 4,000 people who work each year in <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>, 
<PERSON>Jakobsen</PERSON> had long sought the chance to be there. His father was captain of an 
expedition there in <DATE>1950</DATE>, and <PERSON>Jakobsen</PERSON> himself had sailed seven times to the 
Arctic. 
</P>
<P>
The charts <PERSON>Jakobsen</PERSON> used clearly showed the rocks struck by the <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION>. 
The Argentine charts apparently did not. Treaty countries are working now to 
bring all charts used in the area up to date. 
</P>
<P>
Staffo, the environmental officer who previously worked for <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>, cited a 
number of other new safety measures. The <ORGANIZATION>NSF</ORGANIZATION> is testing devices to be carried 
on expeditions that could be tracked by satellite, instantly pinpointing a 
group's location. 
</P>
<P>
But the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> focus is on the environment, especially waste disposal. 
Macerators, which grind up sewage, were installed at <PERSON>Palmer</PERSON> and <LOCATION>McMurdo</LOCATION> 
stations this year; the "gray water" is still pumped into the bays. Palmer, a 
small station with just 40 residents in the <DATE>summer</DATE>, no longer burns its waste 
but rather "retrogrades" it, jargon for shipping it back north. <LOCATION>McMurdo</LOCATION>, a much 
larger center of more than 1,000 in <DATE>summer</DATE>, still burns waste every other 
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, a sore point for <ORGANIZATION>Greenpeace</ORGANIZATION> and other activist groups. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Peter Jorgensen</PERSON>, <PERSON>Palmer</PERSON>'s contract manager, said 10 containers of refuse had 
been shipped back this year, and a chartered ship had hauled away tons of junk 
from the abandoned Old Palmer Station, across <LOCATION>Arthur Harbor</LOCATION>. Several years' 
worth of old low-grade radioactive and dangerous waste was also sent back. 
</P>
<P>
A priority, <PERSON>Staffo</PERSON> said, is to get suppliers to remove all plastics and excess 
packing material before the goods are shipped. "It's much easier to deal with 
it in the States than once it gets out on the ice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> program suffered its own fuel spill this season when 10,000 to 12,000 
gallons of oil spilled from old rubber fuel bladders at the airfield near 
<LOCATION>McMurdo</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Staffo</PERSON> said. Since then, those bladders have been replaced with steel 
tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists at <LOCATION>Palmer</LOCATION> <DATE>last year</DATE> could do little more than watch as the <LOCATION>Bahia 
Paraiso</LOCATION> oil slick spread into nearby tidal coves and beyond. It took six days 
for emergency crews to arrive with oil booms and other gear. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 60,000 gallons of fuel is still aboard the overturned vessel, but 
<ORGANIZATION>NSF</ORGANIZATION> projects the cost at <MONEY>$60 million</MONEY> to remove the wreck. So it will remain in 
its grave on a reef off <LOCATION>DeLaca Island</LOCATION>. American scientist <PERSON>Ted DeLaca</PERSON> was 
working at Palmer at the time and watched the ship founder on the island named 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Mahlon C. Kennicutt II</PERSON>, a scientist from <ORGANIZATION>Texas A&amp;M University</ORGANIZATION>, was 
returning to <PERSON>Palmer</PERSON> for a year-later analysis of the spill's impact. An 
emergency team analysis conducted after the spill, whose results are to be 
published in the <DATE>May</DATE> edition of <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Science</ORGANIZATION> and Technology magazine, 
basically found that the bay made a quick recovery after the initial kill-off 
of thousands of limpets and other invertebrates and about 300 birds. 
</P>
<P>
The pounding of the surf and winds apparently helped cleanse the area within a 
few weeks, <PERSON>Kennicutt</PERSON> said, but he now wants to see whether oil sediment that 
penetrated the shoreline has caused longer-term damage. 
</P>
<P>
He said the group found a very low population of microbes, "proof of how 
pristine the area is, since microbes thrive with pollution." He will study 
whether the microbes, which degrade hydrocarbons, have increased as a result. 
</P>
<P>
"The spill showed up the potential problem of tourism as the number of people 
in the area increases. It's unfortunate, but it gave us a laboratory framework 
to test the magnitude of a spill in such an area," he said. "But for other 
scientists who have been assessing the natural processes, to have this man-made 
event introduced throws all the years of data into doubt."

<TEXT>
   Workers have cleaned up most of the oil
spilled into Antarctic waters from a sunken Argentine ship, but the
accident wiped out a colony of baby birds that scientists were
studying, officials said <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   Lt. <PERSON>Jose Araya</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Chilean navy</ORGANIZATION> said the oil leak from the
ship was stopped after divers patched the damaged hull of the
vessel, the <LOCATION>Bahia Paraiso</LOCATION>.
   But a <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION> official at the <ORGANIZATION>Palmer Station</ORGANIZATION>,
a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Antarctic research facility near where the ship ran aground
on <DATE>Jan. 28</DATE>, said the oil that spill from the vessel has wiped out a
colony of skua chicks.
   Bernhard Lettau, program manager for polar ocean sciences for the
foundation, said the oil killed all but six chicks in a rookery of
53 nests. The skua is a predator bird related to the seagull.
   ``In another two days, we expect the remaining chicks also to be
dead,'' Lettau said by conference call to reporters in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   The deaths of the birds means that no chicks will be produced
this year from a rookery that American scientists have studied for
years on the Antarctic peninsula, about 600 miles from the tip of
<LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>.
   Lettau also said two seals examined seemed to be having
difficulty breathing, some dead gulls were found and mortality has
been ``very high'' among limpids and sponges living near beaches
touched by the fuel oil.
   American scientists are still evaluating the oil spill and ``the
total effect is not yet known,'' he said.
   Thomas Forehand, ocean project manager for the <ORGANIZATION>National Science
Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, said it is doubtful that the Argentine vessel can be
refloated because its damage is so great. It is hoped that it can be
it cut apart and removed, he said.
   Officials are worried about removing the remaining fuel oil and
drums of gasoline from the the vessel without creating another spill.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> have been working to clean
up the wreckage, the first real environmental threat to the
untouched Antarctic.
   <PERSON>Araya</PERSON> said a special skimming boat from the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has
cleaned up most of the oil slick. Asked in a telephone interview
whether the problem is considered under control, <PERSON>Araya</PERSON> replied, ``I
would say so.''
   Araya said the skimming boat had cleaned up <LOCATION>Palmer Bay</LOCATION> two miles
from the ship. The skimming craft was being used <DATE>Friday</DATE> inside a
ring of floating booms set up around the ship to contain the leak.
   The emergency craft is supported by the <ORGANIZATION>Polar Duke</ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>National
Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION> vessel that traveled to the spill carrying 52
tons of cleanup equipment.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Travel: Antarctica, beyond the comfort zone - Michael J.
Woods watches seals, terns and whales in inhospitable waters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With hardly a sound, the sea lapped on to the shore of granite, ground to a
silky smoothness by ice and water - itself blanketed by a layer of snow.
Portly crab-eater seals lay enveloped in the folds of this fluffed and
plumped duvet or sprawled on bluish ice floes carved and drawn like glass
into delicate graceful shapes by the sea. Distant cliffs of rock and ice
loomed through a mist of floating flakes of a soft shower of snow.
Antarctic terns cried and hovered over a shoal of fish, diving and then
swooping upwards on confident wings. But from a distance came the sudden
roar of a collapsing ice cliff which, with immense force, sent a surge of
waves sweeping into the bay, a timely reminder that <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> is far from
placid and, even in the austral <DATE>summer</DATE>, can be fierce and inhospitable.
I had come here to fulfil a childhood dream born out of <LOCATION>Scott</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Amundsen</PERSON> and
<LOCATION>Shackleton</LOCATION>, nurtured by <PERSON>Edmund Hillary</PERSON> and <PERSON>Vivien Fuchs</PERSON> and given a final
push by <PERSON>David Attenborough</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> series, Life In The Freezer.
From Punta Arenas in southern <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> our cruise ship, World Explorer, had
navigated the <ORGANIZATION>Beagle Channel</ORGANIZATION>, rounded the Horn and then braved the <ORGANIZATION>Drake
Passage</ORGANIZATION>, a two-day gauntlet run by every visitor to the <LOCATION>Antarctic Peninsula</LOCATION>.
The gods had been kind, and we stole into the shelter of the <LOCATION>South Shetland
Islands</LOCATION> with half a day in hand.
This gave us time to slip into the <LOCATION>Weddell Sea</LOCATION>, gliding delicately between
tabular icebergs which had calved from the ice shelf and were drifting
slowly away from the continent. These flat-topped monoliths, like blocks of
flats badly cast in concrete, towered high above the seven decks of the
ship. That a further eight ninths plunged into the depths below was almost
beyond comprehension.
Although there were some on board who had no intention of going ashore, and
others who simply wanted to tick off their final continent, many of the
passengers told me that they really weren't 'cruise people.' They were there
because the only way that <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> is readily accessible to ordinary
visitors is by cruise ship.
These not only provide comfortable accommodation with minimal impact on the
environment, but visits to the shore by inflatable Zodiac can be more easily
controlled.
I happened to be on World Discoverer when it was undergoing its biennial
check by an observer from the <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION> who had come along
to ensure that the cruise was being run in a safe way; that passengers were
receiving both education and supervision with regard to the wildlife they
were seeing; and that the operation was observing the guidelines set down by
its own controlling body, the <ORGANIZATION>International Association of Antarctic Tour
Operators</ORGANIZATION> (Iaato).
This may sound dreadfully regimented and restrictive, but some constraints
are clearly necessary as the numbers of visitors, to what amounts to only a
tiny proportion of the continent, grows.
Such controls are at their most extreme only when large numbers of
passengers are ashore. As a result, the expedition leader's advice to take
an early Zodiac ashore and catch the last one back was worth heeding.
On one of my trips ashore I watched a mass of chin-strap penguins in an
odoriferous rookery high on a stony hillside. There were birds feeding
chicks, stealing pebbles from their neighbours' nests, preening, displaying
or making their ponderous and squelchy way over dirty snow to and from the
sea.
On the shore below, a steaming heap of elephant seals wobbled irritably as
one animal tried to burrow further into the pile. Occasionally things proved
too much and a pair reared up, snorting and lunging, until honour was
satisfied and the two brown blancmanges settled down once more.
As we climbed aboard the last Zodiac to leave our final landfall at <LOCATION>Port
Lockroy</LOCATION>, one of the guides spotted the blow of a humpback whale a short
distance away, and we set off over the choppy water for a closer look.
The three great mammals were in no hurry and lazed along on the surface,
breathing noisily before arching their backs with utmost grace and sliding
into the depths, lifting their tails clear of the water - called fluking -
before disappearing with hardly a ripple. The Zodiac, which for a few
seconds had been dwarfed by cetacean tails, erupted with elated cries.
We followed the circular upwellings of water created by thrusts of their
flukes, and were there when they resurfaced after just 3 1/2 minutes. Again
they lazed on the surface; again they fluked. But time was passing and we
had to return to the World Discoverer.
Back on board, the mother ship began to shadow the whales. The sun was
falling in a clear, pale blue sky and our position between the <LOCATION>Antarctic
Peninsula</LOCATION> and several large islands felt as if we were sailing on a vast
lake surrounded by the soaring spires of mountains, unnamed and unexplored,
with dark, snow-dusted peaks piercing the huge iceflows.
These, the product of decades of snow, clawed down the mountain sides and
crumpled over folds in the underlying rock before calving chunks into the
dark blue <LOCATION>Antarctic Ocean</LOCATION>.
The great cetaceans had the muscle to outpace us had they wished, yet they
continued on their leisurely way, fluking and diving to delighted cheers
from the bows.
It would be hard to think of a natural spectacle more magnificent than
watching these massive mammals in a primeval landscape of such grandeur, so
outside the human dimension as to be at once both humbling and
awe-inspiring. Most of those on the ship - some were extremely
well-travelled - were unlikely to experience a scene of such power and
splendour anywhere else.
<PERSON>Michael Woods</PERSON> travelled to <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> c/o Clipper Voyages: Suite 301, <LOCATION>Albany</LOCATION>
house, 324-326 Regent Street, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> W1R 5AA. Reservations: 071-436-2931.
The company runs adventure cruises during the austral <DATE>summer</DATE> (16 nights or
more).
All-inclusive prices, including airfares, transfers, hotels where necessary,
full board on the ship and insurance, start from Pounds 4,606 (1994-1995
season) for the 16-night cruise that Woods experienced (two departures: Dec
4 <DATE>1994</DATE> and Jan 2 <DATE>1995</DATE>). Clipper will be operating a further six voyages to
the Antarctic, taking in, additionally, the <LOCATION>Falklands</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Georgia</LOCATION>.
World Discoverer handles a maximum of 138 passengers.
Clothing: Clipper provides a padded parka but other items are essential.
Thermal underwear as a base layer, and good quality fleece garments such as
those made by <ORGANIZATION>Mountain Equipment</ORGANIZATION> (tel: 061-366-5020) as an intermediate
layer, should be covered with a windproof outer shell. The parka is fine but
<PERSON>Woods</PERSON> found a Goretex outer over a down jacket more flexible. Waterproof
trousers and wellingtons are essential in the Zodiacs and for wet landings.
Photography: take plenty of film as well as spare batteries, which are
exhausted more quickly in the cold. A tripod is useful at the penguin
rookeries and for the seals. Carry polythene bags to protect your gear.

<LEADPARA>  Scottie Bowman leans forward in the office chair and disappears briefly behind
a cluttered desk as he undoes the laces of his skates. It is disconcerting to
see Bowman behind that desk when one is accustomed to seeing Bob Johnson
there, chattering for hours about the most obscure, seemingly irrelevant
hockey subjects.;   Bowman provides an obscure detail of his own. The
Pittsburgh Penguins will play 23 divisional games in the first half, he says,
and 13 of them will be played at home. That tidbit is worthy of Johnson.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  INTERIM STATUS SUITS HIM FINE
PENGUINS' BOWMAN VOWS TO STAY ON JOHNSON'S COURSE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Pro Hockey  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     And after all, <PERSON>Bowman</PERSON> is sitting in <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>'s office, the coach's office,
at <ORGANIZATION>Civic Arena</ORGANIZATION>. There is a wood-paneled locker by the door bearing a nameplate
that reads "<PERSON>B. Johnson</PERSON>." There is a photo of <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> on the wall, and on the
floor is another, of <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>, wife <PERSON>Martha</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>Stanley Cup.</ORGANIZATION>;   Three
banners were raised <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> to the domed ceiling of Civic Arena. The
Penguins won the <ORGANIZATION>Patrick Division</ORGANIZATION> championship in the regular season and the
playoffs. They won the <ORGANIZATION>Prince of Wales Conference</ORGANIZATION>. And they won the Cup that
sits next to <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> in the photograph.;   <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> is fairly beaming in that
shot. The Penguins had 13 coaches in their 23 years before he arrived, and
none managed to win the <ORGANIZATION>Stanley Cup.</ORGANIZATION>;   The team celebrated that achievement
<DATE>Saturday</DATE>, or tried to, before a game against the <ORGANIZATION>New York Rangers</ORGANIZATION>. A telecast
of the game was available in <LOCATION>Colorado Springs</LOCATION>, where <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> is recovering
from the radiation treatments he received for two brain tumors.;   "The whole
family is in <LOCATION>Colorado Springs</LOCATION> and they can watch it on television," Penguins
General Manager <PERSON>Craig Patrick</PERSON> said. "They're going to have a little party and
enjoy the banner-raisings just as we will.";   <DATE>Saturday</DATE> was the <PERSON>Penguins</PERSON>'
third home game; these things usually are done before the opener. The Penguins
had wanted to wait until <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> was well enough to attend the ceremony, but
that wait might be very long.;   So the flags went up <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> and the
diamond rings were handed out <DATE>Monday</DATE>. Now the Penguins try to defend their
championship with another man behind <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>'s desk, behind <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>'s bench.; 
 "My approach, as an interim coach, is to make as few changes as possible,"
said <PERSON>Bowman</PERSON>, who had been perfectly happy in his role as director of player
development. "I feel my role is to try to avoid confusion -- to try to play
the same style of hockey, try to get <PERSON>Mario Lemieux</PERSON> on the ice as much as we
can, try to play him with <PERSON>Paul Coffey</PERSON> . . . the things they did a year ago."; 
 The Penguins are fortunate to have <PERSON>Bowman</PERSON>. No coach has guided more
regular-season triumphs than <PERSON>Bowman</PERSON>'s 743. None has more playoff victories
than <PERSON>Bowman</PERSON>'s 114. The first of his five <ORGANIZATION>Stanley Cup</ORGANIZATION> rings is 18 years old; it
is 15 months younger than the <PERSON>Penguins</PERSON>' Jaromir Jagr.;   <PERSON>Bob Johnson</PERSON>'s first
Cup ring has a skating Penguin in the center and an oval diamond forming the
white belly of the bird's tuxedo. It took a lifetime to earn, and it is
totally unfair there should be so much less time to enjoy it.;   Left wing
<PERSON>Kevin Stevens</PERSON> said, "We pray for Bob," and you had to know they were thinking
of him when the flags went up <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  HE COACHED teams to a league-record 739 victories and five Stanley Cup
championships by ruling with an iron fist, but Scotty Bowman says he is taking
a new approach with the Pittsburgh Penguins.;   Bowman, most famous for
winning five Stanley Cup titles with the Montreal Canadiens during the 1970s,
is trying to carry on the tradition established last season by Penguins Coach
Bob Johnson, who used positive reinforcement and unwavering optimism as tools
to lead the Penguins to their first Stanley Cup championship.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  BOWMAN HAS CHANGED TACTICS SINCE TAKING OVER
PENGUINS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Some information in this report was obtained from writers in other cities.;
Hockey Report  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Although he had no intention of returning to coaching when the <PERSON>Penguins</PERSON>
hired him as a director of player development before last season, <PERSON>Bowman</PERSON> has
been on the <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> bench since doctors discovered in late <DATE>August</DATE> that
<PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> had brain cancer, which ultimately took <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>'s life <DATE>Nov. 26.</DATE>;  
<PERSON>Bowman</PERSON> says life on the bench has been different for him this time around.;  
"This isn't my team, really," <PERSON>Bowman</PERSON> said as he watched the Penguins practice
at the Cow Palace for a game against the Sharks last week. "Times have
changed. The players have changed. I'm just the coach this time. I'm not the
general manager, so I'm free to spend more time with the players and get to
know them a little better.";   <PERSON>Bowman</PERSON> also said some of <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>'s personality
may have rubbed off on him.;   "I saw what he did here," <PERSON>Bowman</PERSON> said. "The
inspiration he gave these players is still with them, and I don't want to try
to break that down. I want to try to keep them upbeat and look for the
positive things.";   So far, <PERSON>Bowman</PERSON> has been well received.;   "We all feel
lucky to have been coached by a man like <PERSON>Bob Johnson</PERSON>, but I think we also feel
fortunate that there was a man like <PERSON>Scotty Bowman</PERSON> there to take over in this
situation," Penguins defenseman <PERSON>Paul Coffey</PERSON> said.; WHITNEY UPDATE: Center <PERSON>Ray
Whitney</PERSON>, the second player chosen by the <ORGANIZATION>Sharks</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>June</DATE>'s entry draft, is
playing for the independent <LOCATION>San Diego Gulls</LOCATION> of the <ORGANIZATION>International Hockey League</ORGANIZATION>
and scored six goals with three assists in his first six games.;   Although
<ORGANIZATION>NHL</ORGANIZATION> rules prohibit the <ORGANIZATION>Sharks</ORGANIZATION> from assigning <LOCATION>Whitney</LOCATION> to their <ORGANIZATION>IHL</ORGANIZATION> affiliate in
<LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION> because he has juniors eligibility remaining, he was able to sign
with the Gulls because they have no NHL affiliate.; DIZZY: Former <PERSON>Olympian
Lane MacDonald</PERSON>, the <DATE>1989</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Hobey Baker Award</ORGANIZATION> winner as the best collegiate
player in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, has retired from hockey and plans to go into
business in <LOCATION>San Francisco.</LOCATION>;   <ORGANIZATION>MacDonald</ORGANIZATION> was still with Team <ORGANIZATION>USA</ORGANIZATION> for an
exhibition game against the Sharks at the Cow Palace on <DATE>Nov. 17</DATE>, but decided
to retire because of a recurring health problem.;   Before joining Team <ORGANIZATION>USA</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>MacDonald</ORGANIZATION> had been out of hockey for two years because of trauma-induced
migraines. He said the problem returned when he took a hit during an
exhibition game against the <LOCATION>Calgary</LOCATION> Flames in <LOCATION>Salt Lake City</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>September.</LOCATION>;  
"I couldn't talk for about 20 minutes," <PERSON>MacDonald</PERSON> said. "I couldn't put a
sentence together. It was just a little scary.";   <ORGANIZATION>MacDonald</ORGANIZATION> scored six goals
for <ORGANIZATION>Team USA</ORGANIZATION> in the <DATE>1988</DATE> winter Olympics.; AROUND THE NHL: To get a feel for
how well <LOCATION>Winnipeg</LOCATION> Jets goalie <PERSON>Bob Essensa</PERSON> is playing, consider this: <PERSON>Essensa</PERSON>
has allowed only 17 goals during the nine-game unbeaten streak that the Jets
are riding even though the Jets have been outshot 328-241 in those games. . .
. Montreal Coach <PERSON>Pat Burns</PERSON>, who was promoting the use of condoms after news
broke that basketball star <ORGANIZATION>Magic Johnson</ORGANIZATION> has the virus that causes AIDS, has
decided he will no longer answer AIDS-related questions because the issue has
become a distraction for his players. "I won't discuss it anymore," <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> told
reporters after practice <DATE>Friday</DATE>. "Hockey is our business, and we'll discuss
hockey, not AIDS or anything else." . . . The debate over realignment has
become more heated since <LOCATION>Winnipeg</LOCATION> officials recently began to press for a move
back to the <ORGANIZATION>Norris Division</ORGANIZATION>, and the issue had to be tabled during a <ORGANIZATION>Board of
Governors</ORGANIZATION> meeting last week. The Jets moved from the <ORGANIZATION>Norris Division</ORGANIZATION> to the
Smythe in <DATE>1982</DATE>, but insist they did so only on the condition that they be
moved back when the league added another western team. That condition was met
when the Sharks joined the league this season, but not everyone wants to
tamper with the status quo. "The whole league is being inconvenienced by the
Jets," one governor told the <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Press</ORGANIZATION>.  </TEXT>
