$550,000 STRAD VIOLIN STOLEN AT L.A. AIRPORT

What was to be a vacation quickly turned into "a nightmare" for <PERSON>Erich 
Gruenberg</PERSON>, when his rare Stradivarius violin, valued at <MONEY>$550,000</MONEY>, was stolen 
shortly after he arrived at <LOCATION>Los Angeles International Airport</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"It is irreplaceable," the 65-year-old English concert violinist said 
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. "It is my life." 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> police said the Stradivarius, along with a second <PERSON>Hirsch</PERSON> violin 
valued at <MONEY>$8,000</MONEY>, were stolen <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, shortly after <PERSON>Gruenberg</PERSON> and 
his wife, Korshed, arrived from <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> on a <ORGANIZATION>British Airways</ORGANIZATION> flight. 
</P>
<P>
"They were taken off a cart after he cleared customs," said Detective <PERSON>William 
Martin</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>LAPD</ORGANIZATION>'s specialist in art theft. 
</P>
<P>
The detective said he believes that the thieves probably did not know the 
simple, tan-colored oblong case contained violins. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless they had X-ray vision, they couldn't know what was inside," <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Police statistics show there have been an average 181 thefts a month at the 
airport so far this year, or about six a day. 
</P>
<P>
On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <PERSON>Gruenberg</PERSON>, apparently yet another victim, kept reliving and 
retelling those few seconds when the theft occurred, as though he could not 
believe it happened. 
</P>
<P>
The tall, pale Londoner, who has been concertmaster of the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Symphony 
Orchestra</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Philharmonic</ORGANIZATION> and is now an international concert 
soloist, is staying at the <LOCATION>Pacific Palisades</LOCATION> home of <PERSON>Harold Hirsch</PERSON>, an old 
friend and the maker of the second stolen violin. 
</P>
<P>
Seated on a sofa, <PERSON>Gruenberg</PERSON> told a reporter that he was loading his luggage 
into <PERSON>Hirsch</PERSON>'s Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
"I put two suitcases in the trunk." <PERSON>Gruenberg</PERSON> said, and, as was his custom, 
went to take the violins inside the car with him. 
</P>
<P>
"The violin never goes in the trunk," <PERSON>Korshed Gruenberg</PERSON> said as she sat nearby, 
visibly upset and near tears. 
</P>
<P>
Gruenberg continued: "I turned around, I said to my wife, 'Darling, where's the 
violin?' I looked right and left, back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I thought, this is a bad dream." 
</P>
<P>
Instruments created by <PERSON>Antonio Stradivari</PERSON>, the 17th- and 18th-Century violin 
maker, are considered unsurpassed in sound quality. Only about 650 still exist 
and they are often used by the world's leading players. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the people who took it were not aware of what they took," <PERSON>Gruenberg</PERSON> 
said. "I hope they just left it somewhere and somebody will find it, and return 
it to me." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with knowledge of the instruments' whereabouts should call the <ORGANIZATION>Los 
Angeles Police Department</ORGANIZATION>. The Austrian-born violinist added that he "would 
consider some kind of reward" for their return. The instruments are insured, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Gruenberg</PERSON> said he acquired the Stradivarius from a violin dealer in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> in 
<DATE>1974</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
For a serious musician, he said, throughout life "you try to find an instrument 
you bond with. You become like a team." 
</P>
<P>
"He just played a few strings of that and I said, 'Eric you don't give it 
back,' " <PERSON>Korshed Gruenberg</PERSON> said, recalling the day the couple first saw the 
Stradivarius. "I love it so much. It's like mine, too. I feel like someone has 
kidnaped my daughter." 
</P>
<P>
During their planned three-week vacation, <PERSON>Gruenberg</PERSON> said, he had agreed to do a 
private recording of a concerto composed by a <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> professor later this week. 
Even though he may not have his precious instrument, or his second violin, 
<PERSON>Gruenberg</PERSON> said he will still meet the engagement. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, you can play any violin," he said. "I'll borrow another violin from 
<PERSON>Mr. Hirsch</PERSON>." 
</P>
<P>
But it will make a difference, <PERSON>Gruenberg</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference would be difficult to explain. It's like defining quality," the 
violinist said, quietly. "What you pay for in a violin is an indefinable depth 
and color in sound. If you compare it to a mountain lake, the light shines on 
it like iridescence, and there is depth; endless depths. 
</P>
<P>
"With other instruments in five minutes, they can't give me anything new."

A Stradivarius violin valued at <MONEY>$550,000</MONEY> was reported stolen from a baggage 
cart at <LOCATION>Los Angeles International Airport</LOCATION>, but police said the thief probably 
did not know what he was taking. 
</P>
<P>
The rare instrument, along with a second <PERSON>Hirsch</PERSON> violin valued at <MONEY>$8,000</MONEY>, was 
taken from concert violinist <PERSON>Erich Gruenberg</PERSON> after he arrived from <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> via

<P>
"They were taken off a cart after he cleared customs," said Detective <PERSON>William

<PERSON>Gruenberg</PERSON> apparently left the cart briefly after rolling it outside the

</P>
<P>
"I'm just devastated," <PERSON>Gruenberg</PERSON>, a 65-year-old Austrian-born violinist who 
lives in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> of the loss of the Stradivarius. "It is 
irreplaceable."

The case containing the instruments was rectangular, not shaped like a violin.

<TEXT>
   A musician's Stradivarius violin, worth about
half a <MONEY>million dollars</MONEY>, was snatched from an airport baggage cart,
police said.
   <PERSON>Erich Gruenberg</PERSON>, 65, was carrying the violin, crafted in <DATE>1731</DATE>,
as he checked through customs after arriving from <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> at <LOCATION>Los
Angeles International Airport</LOCATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, said city
police Sgt. <PERSON>Dave Nichols</PERSON>.
   The musician reported the violin disappeared from the baggage
cart as he was leaving the airport, <PERSON>Nichols</PERSON> said.
   The instrument was insured for about <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY>. Also stolen were
a violin worth <MONEY>$8,000</MONEY> and two bows worth <MONEY>$3,500</MONEY>.
   There were no arrests by early today, <PERSON>Nichols</PERSON> said.
   Thefts at the airport are a common occurrence, but the thief may
not have realized what it was he was plucking from the cart,
<PERSON>Nichols</PERSON> said.
   ``If he reads the paper he will, so I guess it won't take him
too long to figure it out,'' he said.
   Scholars estimate that <PERSON>Antonio Stradivari</PERSON> made nearly 1,120 of
the prized violins bearing his name before his death in <DATE>1737</DATE>. Less
than a few hundred are believed to exist.
   <PERSON>Gruenberg</PERSON>'s whereabouts were not known. <PERSON>Nichols</PERSON> said he believed
that <PERSON>Gruenberg</PERSON> came to <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> on vacation and was staying with
friends.
   The Austrian-born performer and music teacher makes his home in
<LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and has played with the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Symphony Orchestra</ORGANIZATION>. He now
appears as a soloist with leading orchestras in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and abroad.
He was made an honorary member of the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Academy of Music</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> on <DATE>July 4</DATE>.

<TEXT>
   A Stradivarius violin fetched a world record
auction price for a musical instrument of <MONEY>$889,240</MONEY> at a <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s
sale today, the auctioneers said.
   The violin, made in <DATE>1709</DATE> by Italian craftsman <PERSON>Antonio
Stradivari</PERSON>, is named after the master English violinist <PERSON>Marie Hall</PERSON>.
Composer <PERSON>Vaughan Williams</PERSON> composed ``The Lark Ascending'' for <PERSON>Hall</PERSON>,
which she first performed in <DATE>1920</DATE>.
   An unidentified private South American buyer beat out two other
dealers bidding by telephone in a tense, two-minute auction.
   ``It was quite drawn out and tense and there was a round of
applause at the end,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s spokeswoman <PERSON>Beth McHattie</PERSON>.
   The <PERSON>Marie Hall</PERSON> had been expected to sell for around <MONEY>$846,000</MONEY>,
and bidding started at <MONEY>$376,000</MONEY>, <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s said.
   The previous highest auction price for a Stradivarius was
<MONEY>$728,000</MONEY> for The Colossus, dated <DATE>1716</DATE>, which was sold at <ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s
auction house in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> <DATE>last April</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Guinness Book of Records</ORGANIZATION> says the highest known price for a
Stradivarius was <MONEY>$1.2 million</MONEY>. But that was in a private sale of
Stradivarius' Alard violin by <PERSON>W. E. Hill</PERSON> and Sons to a Singaporean
on an unknown date.
   About 700 of 1,116 violins by Stradivarius have survived.
   <PERSON>Marie Hall</PERSON>, considered one of the finest violinists of her era,
died at age 72 in <DATE>1956</DATE>.
   She acquired the violin in <DATE>1905</DATE> and it was passed on to her
daughter when she died. When it was last auctioned by <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s in
<DATE>November 1968</DATE>, the violin sold for a then world record price of
<MONEY>$52,600</MONEY>.
   The violin was included in a day-long sale of violins, violas
and other stringed instruments.

   A <DATE>1709</DATE> Stradivarius violin named in honor of
English concert musician <PERSON>Marie Hall</PERSON> was sold <DATE>Thursday</DATE> for <MONEY>$889,240</MONEY>,
the highest auction price ever paid for a musical instrument.
   The violin, acquired by <PERSON>Miss Hall</PERSON> in <DATE>1905</DATE>, was bought by an
unidentified South American dealer, <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s reported. The dealer
beat out two other foreign rivals bidding by telephone in a tense,
two-minute auction.
   The previous highest auction price for a violin by Italian
craftsman <PERSON>Antonio Stradivari</PERSON> was <MONEY>$728,000</MONEY>. ``The Colossus,'' dated
<DATE>1716</DATE>, was bought last year by Italian violinist <PERSON>Luigi Alberto
Bianchi</PERSON>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Guinness Book of Records</ORGANIZATION> says the highest known price for a
Stradivarius is <MONEY>$1.2 million</MONEY>, but that was in a private sale of
<PERSON>Stradivari</PERSON>'s ``Alard'' violin by British dealers <PERSON>W.E. Hill</PERSON> and Sons
to a <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> dealer.
   Bidding started <DATE>Thursday</DATE> at <MONEY>$470,000</MONEY>, said <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s spokeswoman
<PERSON>Beth McHattie</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Marie Hall</PERSON>, considered one of the finest violinists of her era,
died at age 72 in <DATE>1956</DATE>. British composer <PERSON>Vaughan Williams</PERSON> dedicated
his ``The Lark Ascending'' to her, and she first performed it on
her Stradivarius in <DATE>1920</DATE>.
   Miss <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> bequeathed the violin, previously known as the
``Viotti'' after <PERSON>Giovanni Battista Viotti</PERSON>, to her daughter.
   The owner who sold it on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> was not identified.
   The instrument was last auctioned in <DATE>1968</DATE>, when it sold for
<MONEY>$52,600</MONEY> _ a record at the time.
   <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s auction ``was quite drawn out and tense and there was
a round of applause at the end,'' said <PERSON>Ms. McHattie</PERSON>. ``We're
absolutely delighted to be the record holders again.''
   The violin, kept in very good condition, had been expected to
fetch up to <MONEY>$846,000</MONEY>, she said. It has a distinctive tiger-stripe
wood grain pattern and is varnished in a rich orange-brown color.
   About 700 of 1,116 violins by <PERSON>Stradivari</PERSON> have survived.

<TEXT>
   A 270-year-old Stradivarius violin named after the
descendants of composer <PERSON>Felix Mendelssohn</PERSON> sold <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> for <MONEY>$1.76
million</MONEY>, the highest price paid at auction for a musical
instrument, <ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s said.
   The violin, known as <ORGANIZATION>The Mendelssohn</ORGANIZATION>, was purchased by a private
buyer in the salesroom who asked not to be identified.
   ``It was owned by an American collector for the past 35 years
and he probably played it a bit,'' said <PERSON>William Hanham</PERSON>, the
auctioneers' spokesman.
   ``The fact that it had been off the market for a long time was a
considerable help to the price,'' he added. ``We believe that more
expensive instruments have been sold privately.''
   The previous owner, who remained anonymous, sold the violin to
aid the <ORGANIZATION>United Jewish Appeal-Federation</ORGANIZATION> of Jewish Philanthropies of
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   Antonio <PERSON>Stradivari</PERSON> made the violin in <LOCATION>Cremona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1720</DATE>
toward the end of his ``golden period'' when he produced his finest
instruments. The greatest ones are usually given personal names.
   The violin was named after its owners in the <DATE>19th century</DATE>, the
<PERSON>Mendelssohn</PERSON> family of <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION>.
   The previous musical instrument auction record was <MONEY>$1.22 million</MONEY>
for a Stradivarius cello in <DATE>1988</DATE>.
   The same year, a <PERSON>Baron Heath</PERSON> violin made in <DATE>1743</DATE> by <PERSON>Giuseppe
Guarnieri</PERSON> fetched <MONEY>$1.12 million</MONEY> at auction.

   Criminals holding a 273-year-old Stradivarius violin
stolen three years ago are seeking <MONEY>$2.5 million</MONEY> in ransom, an

   The instrument, once owned by the last czar of <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Nicholas

   It was reportedly in the trunk of his car, which was stolen when

   The violin was made in <DATE>1676</DATE> by Austrian
<PERSON>Jakob Steiner</PERSON>. It may be as valuable as a Stradivarius. And it was
left behind by burglars in a run-down apartment raided by police.
   Police believe the violin was stolen from the home of a family

   Detective <PERSON>Tom Ryan</PERSON> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> he found the violin as he

which they said also had been used by two other men as a stash house
for stolen property. Ryan said he suspects the other men took the
violin in an <DATE>Oct. 20</DATE> burglary.
   Violins made by <PERSON>Steiner</PERSON>, who died in <DATE>1683</DATE>, may be even rarer than
those of the Italian Antonio Stradivari because <PERSON>Steiner</PERSON> made fewer
of them, according to some collectors.

<HL> Violin Makers Fret As Musicians Fiddle With Their A-Strings --- Demand for Modern Sounds From Ancient Instruments Arouses Fear of Damage </HL>
<AUTHOR> Philip Revzin (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<DATELINE> CREMONA, Italy  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
    The 80 master violin makers of this North Italian town share a collective nightmare:
   A famous violinist is midway through a vigorous Beethoven cadenza on a priceless Stradivarius. 
The 300-year-old instrument -- its strings stretched taut to produce a strong, brilliant sound -- begins to groan, then cracks. 
Suddenly, it explodes. 

   "It could happen," warns violin maker <PERSON>Stefano Conia</PERSON> as he fondly strokes the belly of one of his glistening new violins in his crowded workshop. 

   So far, it apparently hasn't, at least like that. 
But that's irrelevant. 
This is where <PERSON>Antonio Stradivari</PERSON>, <PERSON>Nicolo Amati</PERSON> and <PERSON>Giuseppi Guarneri</PERSON> del Gesu made their world-renowned stringed instruments in the 17th and 18th centuries. 
And that imposes a special burden on residents. 
So <PERSON>Mr. Conia</PERSON> worries. 
"What people are doing to these old violins is crazy," he says. 

   Calmly stated, what people are doing is tuning old violins according to new musical fashion. 
A more passionate view might be that musical treasures are being dangerously souped up to keep pace with unreasonable competitive demands. 

   The problem begins at A. 
In fact, that's pretty much the whole problem. 

   When the first Cremonese masters were making their violins, violas and cellos, everybody agreed that the pitch of A above middle C was around 420 cycles per second, or 420 hertz. 
Since A is the tuning note on which other notes -- up and down -- are based, first A is tuned in, then all strings are tightened accordingly. 
With A at 420 hertz, these instruments, which many say are unequaled for tone quality, sounded warm and rich among the few other strings in a small chamber orchestra. 

   But as orchestras and concert halls got bigger, musicians started to tune their instruments sharper, raising the pitch of A and thus all other notes. 
The more brilliant, more piercing sound could be heard above other players and delight listeners even at the top of the third balcony. 

   The more that violinists tightened their strings, the more pressure they put on their violin bodies. 
Singers had to reach for higher notes, putting more pressure on their bodies, too. 
By the time <PERSON>Giuseppi Verdi</PERSON> was writing his operas in the <DATE>mid-19th century</DATE>, A had sharpened to 435 hertz. 
That, <PERSON>Verdi</PERSON> thought, was enough for both man and machine. 
He got an international meeting in <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION> in <DATE>1885</DATE> to fix A at that level. 

   It didn't last. 
In <DATE>1939</DATE> another international meeting set A at 440 hertz, which is what comes from <PERSON>Mr. Conia</PERSON>'s tuning fork. 
He takes it off a peg on the wall and bings it on his chair. 
"Even 440 is too much, but okay, let's stop there," he says. 

   Few have. 
Many orchestras tune today to 443, 445, or even 450 hertz, stretching strings ever tighter. 
<PERSON>Sergio Renzi</PERSON>, director of <LOCATION>Cremona</LOCATION>'s violin-making school, says he has heard of tunings of 460 hertz. 

   That's just "murderous" for any violin, he says, and especially so for the 500 to 600 old Cremonese violins still being played (out of a couple of thousand produced by the masters). 
These instruments are usually on loan to stellar soloists from investors who buy them at auction or privately. 
Values range from six figures into the millions. 
A Stradivarius cello used by <ORGANIZATION>Yo Yo Ma</ORGANIZATION> went for <MONEY>$1.2 million</MONEY> last month. 

   The idea is that the instruments are kept healthy by use; stashed away unplayed, their vitality withers. 
But what kind of use? 
"The strings are now pulled so tight that they put enormous strain, driving the bridge {the small wood piece that holds up the strings} right down into the belly," <PERSON>Mr. Conia</PERSON> says, pressing on the midsection of his violin. 
He argues that even reinforcements and alterations made to most old Cremonese instruments over the years won't stand much more. 

   "New violins are built for this, but 300-year-old wood can't take it," he says. 

   So concerned are the Cremonese that at a recent conference to mark the school's <DATE>50th birthday</DATE> and the 250th anniversary of <PERSON>Stradivari</PERSON>'s death, experts called for a return to 432 hertz as the standard A. 

   So far, reaction has been akin to the sound made by a violin with no strings at all. 
"There's no crisis, just a problem that has been around for 100 years," says <PERSON>Laurence Libin</PERSON>, curator of musical instruments at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
"The Italians are always issuing grand statements but nobody pays much attention to them." 

   Says conductor <PERSON>Georg Solti</PERSON>: "I've never seen or heard of a violin breaking because of the pitch, but it is pretty high today and it's very bad for the singers -- they can't reach the high notes." 
He prefers 440, no higher. 
Some say that while there may not yet be cases of catastrophic breakage, they have seen gradual damage. 
Higher tuning is championed by orchestral players who want to stand out in the middle of the second violin section, but disapproved by some soloists who want to safeguard their investments. 

   <PERSON>Yehudi Menuhin</PERSON>, the violinist, conductor and teacher, plays a 1742 Guarneri known as "the Lord Wilson" and valued at <MONEY>$2.5 million</MONEY>. 
He favors a lower tuning but thinks the proposed pre-Verdi-era 432 hertz is unrealistic. 
"Our modern ears would consider that rather flat. 
The consumer wants his music brilliant and glossy." 

   That's too bad, too, Sir Yehudi feels. 
"Our ever more competitive age has not only pushed up inflation, it's pushed up the pitch. 
The Viennese are the guiltiest, the British the gentlest. 
A British oboist will often give you a nice, low A, so you can tune right down." 

   These days, as soon as he comes offstage, Sir Yehudi loosens his violin's A and E strings completely. 
But he has given up arguing with conductors about tuning. 
"It's hopeless. 
The most you can hope for is that the orchestra plays in tune at all." 

   Conductor Antonio de Almeida, though himself a proponent of lower tuning, maintains conductors can't do much anyway, given commercial considerations. 
"Music has become such a business, everybody says to hell with what comes naturally. 
If it sells, let's do it," he says. 
"Any move to a lower A would run into tremendous resistance. 
If a record company gets better compact-disk recordings with a higher A, that's what they'll go for." 

   That's fine with some people, too. 
"Life is hard enough. 
Brilliance is what it's all about," says <PERSON>Elmar Olivira</PERSON>, a prize-winning soloist who plays a <DATE>1692</DATE> Strad worth about <MONEY>$400,000</MONEY>. 
"Nobody can stand up in front of the <LOCATION>Philadelphia Orchestra</LOCATION> and hope to project and stand out at 435 hertz." 

   He says his violin is in "wonderful shape" despite centuries of playing, and he's comfortable at tunings between 442 and 447 hertz. 
"Violins don't exist in isolation, they exist to be played," he says. 

   In <LOCATION>Cremona</LOCATION>, however, the goal is brilliance without side effects. 
Most makers produce a couple of dozen violins a year, priced from <MONEY>$5,000</MONEY> to <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Conia</PERSON>'s workshop, typically, is littered with bits of violin bodies, reeks of resinous varnish and hums to the sound of violin concertos played continuously over the stereo system. 
He painstakingly shapes thin strips of pine and maple, and applies 30 coats of varnish, as did <PERSON>Stradivari</PERSON>. 

   And he continues to battle. 
He often plays in local churches and town halls. 
The churches he prefers are ones with old, slightly flat organs. 
"I can tune way, way down, and be nice to my violin," he says, giving it a pat. 
"And nobody can tell the difference."

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A best-selling author whose hard luck
has forced him to live out of his van was offered shelter by the
widow of a man who harbored a famous stolen violin for almost 50
years.
   <PERSON>Marcelle Hall</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Bethel</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, said <DATE>Friday</DATE> she tracked down
<PERSON>Charles Webb</PERSON>, author of ``The Graduate,'' and his ex-wife wife at a
western <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> motel <DATE>earlier this week</DATE> and offered to take
them in after reading of their plight.
   ``I jumped right to the phone as if some power was leading me,''
<PERSON>Mrs. Hall</PERSON> said in a telephone interview. ``I saw their picture and
I thought, `They probably do the same things I do, give it all
away, and sometimes you get shafted.'''
   She said she hoped <PERSON>Webb</PERSON> would write a book about the stolen
violin and how she came to be married to the man who held it for a
half-century.
   But <PERSON>Webb</PERSON>'s ex-wife, who uses only the name Fred and who
continues to live with him, said <PERSON>Webb</PERSON> might not be able to write
such a book.
   ``The only problem is that <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> doesn't know if he can write
the story about the violin. He hasn't written anything factual,''
she said.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Hall</PERSON> gained national attention last year when she said her
second husband, <PERSON>Julian Altman</PERSON>, confessed before he died in <DATE>Aug. 15,
1985</DATE>, that his violin was a stolen Stradivarius he had bought for
<MONEY>$100</MONEY> from the man who had stolen it. The violin was stolen at <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Carnegie Hall</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1936</DATE> from <PERSON>Bronislaw Huberman</PERSON>, an
internationally known violinist who died in <DATE>1947</DATE>.
   The violin was authenticated for its insurer, <PERSON>Lloyd</PERSON>'s of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>,
which had paid <MONEY>$30,000</MONEY> to <PERSON>Huberman</PERSON>. Last year, <LOCATION>Lloyd</LOCATION>'s insured it
for <MONEY>$800,000</MONEY> and reportedly intended to sell it, and <PERSON>Mrs. Hall</PERSON> said
<PERSON>Lloyd</PERSON>'s was going to pay her a reward.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Hall</PERSON> said she met <PERSON>Altman</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> in <DATE>1968</DATE> and they
married in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION> in <DATE>March 1985</DATE>, two days before he was
sentenced to two years in jail for sexually molesting one of her
granddaughters.
   She said <DATE>Friday</DATE> that she had married him to regain control of
her financial holdings. After serving four months of his sentence,
he was diagnosed with stomach cancer and moved to a hospital where
he died, <PERSON>Mrs. Hall</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Webb</PERSON>'s <DATE>1962</DATE> novel was made into the hit movie of the same name
starring <PERSON>Dustin Hoffman</PERSON>. The movie evoked the discontent of a
generation fed up with materialism. He and Fred came to
<LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> in search of a publisher after living for a decade in
their van in southern <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.
   In more prosperous days, the Webbs had given away two houses out
of a need, <PERSON>Webb</PERSON> said, to ``get free of things.''
   Fred said the couple would drive to <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> to
meet <PERSON>Mrs. Hall</PERSON> and consider the offer. ``It sounds a little bit
gothic, but we might be able to handle something like that,'' she
said.
   Webb wrote four novels until <DATE>1978</DATE>, when he stopped writing.
   The Webbs divorced <DATE>eight years ago after 20 years</DATE> of marriage
because they believed the institution of marriage violated their
constitutional rights to freedom, <PERSON>Fred</PERSON> said.

<HL> Your Money Matters:
Old Instruments
Hit Sweet Notes
For Wise Buyers

<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Charles Rudig</PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s musical instrument department in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, scours flea markets, auctions and antique shops for harpsichords, oboes and the like -- for himself and for the company. 
Some of his finds cram his <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> apartment and a rented storage room. 

   Among them is a <PERSON>Cramer</PERSON> celesta, an unusual antique English keyboard instrument that produces bell-like tones. 
<PERSON>Mr. Rudig</PERSON> came across the celesta on an outing in <DATE>1980</DATE>. 
"I just had to have it," he says. 
He paid <MONEY>$500</MONEY> for it. 
The instrument was recently appraised at <MONEY>$2,000</MONEY>. 

   For the right kind of investor, musical instruments offer the possibility of good returns -- and, perhaps, more tangible enjoyment than securities in a safe-deposit box. 
But investment advisers caution that the field isn't for those without expertise or substantial resources. 

   <PERSON>James D. Koster</PERSON>, an investment adviser in <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz</LOCATION>, says that while musical instruments can appreciate rapidly, they can be difficult investments. 
As with other collectibles, liquidity is a problem: If a need for cash arises, it may be difficult to find a buyer quickly for an antique instrument. 
And unlike a block of stock, "you can't sell a little piece of a violin. 
You have to sell the whole thing." 
Also, some instruments require special maintenance. 

   Investors shouldn't tie up more than <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> of their assets in instruments, <PERSON>Mr. Koster</PERSON> says. 
But despite the limitations, he says, instruments offer a "very exciting investment with high appreciation." 

   Many appraisers, however, expect appreciation in the coming decade to fall short of the gains of the past 20 years. 
While the future of any collectible market is hard to predict, appraisers say they expect antique instruments generally to double in value over the next decade. 
At the start of the boom 20 years ago, prices of some instruments rose ten-fold in about three years. 
Since then, prices generally have doubled about every five years. 

   The spurt has been fueled by investors who earlier concentrated on paintings and sculpture, says <PERSON>Mr. Rudig</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's</ORGANIZATION>. 
These investors came to view antique instruments as works of art with musical value, he says. 
As with many other collectibles, the rapid inflation of the <DATE>1970s</DATE> boosted values. 
Changing musical tastes also have played a part: More and more orchestral musicians are seeking an antique sound they can only get from older instruments, he says. 

   Potential investors who aren't expert in the field should have instruments appraised before buying them, says <PERSON>Fred W. Oster</PERSON>, an official in <LOCATION>Christie</LOCATION>'s musical instrument department. 
A hairline crack in the wrong place, he says, can be enough to make an instrument virtually worthless. 

   One basic rule: An instrument that can't be played isn't worth much. 
A <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> investor paid <MONEY>$500</MONEY> for a vintage flute, then discovered that it made only a honking sound. 
To date, he hasn't been offered more than <MONEY>$100</MONEY> for it. 

   In general, specialists say, the most lucrative instruments are antique strings -- violins, violas and cellos. 
Buying this kind of fine antique involves little risk, they say. 
Violins are considered the most valuable member of this group; their rate of appreciation is highest. 
A Stradivarius that sold 20 years ago for about <MONEY>$40,000</MONEY> now commands more than <MONEY>$400,000</MONEY>. 

   More modest investments are available in antique woodwinds, like flutes, oboes and recorders. 
<PERSON>Sydney G. Rosenblatt</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> sold a Haynes flute last <DATE>December</DATE> for about <MONEY>$3,500</MONEY>. 
While he won't disclose his profit, he says the item would have brought about <MONEY>$1,500</MONEY> a decade ago. 
But woodwinds involve more risk than string instruments, because their prices haven't been as long established. 

   <PERSON>Michael Sweeney</PERSON>, who owns a piano store in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, says American pianos built between the turn of the century and the Depression have become collectibles. 
<PERSON>Marilyn Gushner</PERSON>, a housewife in <LOCATION>Gladwyne</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, bought a <DATE>1924</DATE> Cunningham player piano four years ago for <MONEY>$3,600</MONEY> while it was "still in a million pieces." 
She recently had it appraised at <MONEY>$6,000</MONEY>. 

   The instruments of famous musicians, even if not antiques, can draw hefty prices. 
<PERSON>Efrem Kurtz</PERSON>, a conductor, reaped a windfall when he auctioned off a platinum flute that had belonged to one of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s greatest flutists, <PERSON>William Kincaid</PERSON>. 
Last <DATE>October</DATE>, at <ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, the flute brought <MONEY>$187,000</MONEY>, the highest price ever recorded for a woodwind instrument.

<LEADPARA>  THE CONCERN now is not the eagle's survival, but whether it will be able to

in Woodside last month is expected to live.;   The original prognosis for the

bird, estimated to be 4 to 8 years old, has a broken, infected left wing. In
addition to blindness in one eye, the bird also suffered head injuries.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Rescue workers at first were pessimistic about its chance of survival. But
the eagle pulled through, and the infection is under control. "He's much
perkier," said <PERSON>Valerie Baldwin</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Rescue Inc.</ORGANIZATION> worker who is taking
care of the raptor. The bird now weighs 9.4 pounds, two more than when it was
first brought in.;   Last week, veterinarian <PERSON>Ron May-Pumphrey</PERSON> operated on the
bird to reset a pin in its injured wing. Whether it ever will fly like an
eagle again remains in doubt. "It may be weeks, it may be months," <PERSON>Baldwin</PERSON>
said, "before we'll know for sure.";   Of course, should the eagle lose its
ability to fly, it will be kept in captivity for the rest of its life.;

Special Agent <PERSON>Ken McCloud</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Fish and <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Service</ORGANIZATION>. The

View schools are looking for a few violins for their string-instrument
students. Higher enrollment and shrinking budgets have forced school officials
to look for alternative ways to come up with 25 violins to meet the demands of
youngsters who can't afford the instrument.;   The string-music program at
<ORGANIZATION>Graham Middle School</ORGANIZATION> and the four elementary schools now has more than 175
students, said <PERSON>Linda Snyder</PERSON>, a string-music teacher. "We have so much more
interest than we have had in the past," she said.;   Last year, the district
was able to purchase eight new violins. This year, none. It's not as though
the district is looking for a Stradivarius. Still, a "bottom of the line"
violin costs <MONEY>$255-250</MONEY> if bought in a bunch of five, <PERSON>Snyder</PERSON> said.;   If you

   FIDDLE RIDDLE: Is there life after 250 for a Stradivarius? 

   Musician <PERSON>Louis A. Browning</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, paid <MONEY>$130,000</MONEY> for a Stradivarius made in <DATE>1736</DATE>, <MONEY>$27,000</MONEY> for a 1779 Gabbrielli, and <MONEY>$24,000</MONEY> for a <DATE>1675</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Ruggeri</ORGANIZATION>. 
He sought to depreciate them over 12 years, to the tune of more than <MONEY>$15,000</MONEY> a year in deductions. 
But the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> denied the deductions, challenging the 12-year-useful-life forecast as too short and arguing that the rare violins' "salvage" value would rise, not fall to zero. 
So <PERSON>Browning</PERSON> appealed to the <ORGANIZATION>Tax Court</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <PERSON>Browning</PERSON>, backed by a dealer, said the Strad ("not a prime specimen") and its value would deteriorate with use. 
Yet the dealer had appraised it for insurance at <MONEY>$225,000</MONEY> five years after selling it to <PERSON>Browning</PERSON> and wouldn't speculate on the value after 12 years. 
<PERSON>Judge Hamblen</PERSON> found no evidence that the Strad would be worthless after 12 years or that its useful life would end at that point. 
Browning offered no direct evidence relating to the other two violins. 

   <PERSON>Browning</PERSON>'s claims were "arbitrary and unreasonable," the judge said in upholding the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION>. 

   THIS <ORGANIZATION>IRA</ORGANIZATION> CHECK missed the trick: It bounced instead of rolling over. 

   You may withdraw cash temporarily from an individual retirement account and escape a tax or penalty, if you roll it all over into another <ORGANIZATION>IRA</ORGANIZATION> in 60 days. 
That's a rigid "if," as a chap we'll call Chip found. 
He took cash from an <ORGANIZATION>IRA</ORGANIZATION> at one bank last <DATE>Aug. 14</DATE> and wrote a check on <DATE>Oct. 7</DATE> for a rollover <ORGANIZATION>IRA</ORGANIZATION> at another. 
He drew the check on yet a third bank, where a clerical error had restricted his account's credit. 

   Chip's check bounced. 
After clearing up the snafu, he wrote a new check on <DATE>Oct. 28</DATE> -- two weeks after the 60-day deadline -- that set up a new <ORGANIZATION>IRA</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Nov. 2</DATE>. 
The delay wasn't my fault, he told the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION>, so I should be allowed a rollover. 
Not so, says <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> private ruling 8824047: Tax law and regulations don't permit any waivers or extensions of the 60-day period. 
Chip's transaction fails to qualify as an <ORGANIZATION>IRA</ORGANIZATION> rollover. 

   EQUITY BEATS OUT consistency in handling disgorged profits, it appears. 

   Last week, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <PERSON>Judge Owen</PERSON> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> denied requests by insider-trader <PERSON>Dennis Levine</PERSON> and conspirator <PERSON>Robert Wilkis</PERSON> to pay back taxes out of disgorged profits, not other resources. 
The profits are to be held in trust "for the benefit of defrauded investors," the judge ruled. 
Yet in <DATE>October</DATE>, <PERSON>Owen</PERSON> had granted the similar requests of ring members <ORGANIZATION>Ira B. Sokolow</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>David S. Brown</PERSON>. 
So lawyers for <PERSON>Levine</PERSON> and Wilkis denounced the unfavorable inconsistency. 

   What's going on? 
Owen's rulings don't address consistency directly, but suggest it's irrelevant. 
Tax claims may be paid at the court's "equitable discretion," he wrote in <DATE>October</DATE>; he considered the defendants' roles in the conspiracy, the amounts of their profits, and other factors. 
As to ringleader <PERSON>Levine</PERSON> and Wilkis, he wrote last week, the courts "have general equity powers to remedy violations of the securities laws and to fashion appropriate remedies." 

   The <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION>, eager for its share, hasn't indicated whether it will appeal the latest ruling. 

   I WON'T PAY the <MONEY>$60</MONEY> filing fee or show I can't pay, <PERSON>Bruce Charles Frazier</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION>Tax Court</ORGANIZATION> in appealing an <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> bill; he wanted a waiver for raising a constitutional issue. 
But for not paying, the court has dismissed his claims; it also upheld a civil fraud penalty. 

   EMPLOYERS now are liable for Social Security tax on unreported tip income uncovered in audits of employees. 
An employer can set up a reserve for that contingency; but doing it may look like an admission of incorrect tip reporting, warns <PERSON>David J. Silverman</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> tax adviser. 

   WAYS AND MEANS adds <ORGANIZATION>Clay Shaw</ORGANIZATION> (R., <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>) to fill a vacancy caused by the death of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> committee's ranking minority member, <PERSON>John Duncan</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>). 
<PERSON>Bill Archer</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> succeeded <PERSON>Duncan</PERSON> as the committee's ranking Republican member. 

   MORTGAGE SUBSIDIES would be targeted to more of the needy. 

   State and local authority to sell exempt bonds to finance low-interest mortgages for first-home buyers expires <DATE>Dec. 31</DATE>. 
Tax-bill writers propose to extend it through <DATE>1990</DATE> and to tighten eligibility in response to critics and suggestions from the <ORGANIZATION>General Accounting Office</ORGANIZATION>, which has questioned the efficacy of the subsidies. 
The aim is to get aid to the needy and exclude many families that can afford market-rate mortgages. 

   The bill doesn't go as far as the <ORGANIZATION>GAO</ORGANIZATION> would. 
But it would lower the income ceiling for childless families, giving an advantage to parents. 
It would adjust income limits in areas where housing costs are very high or very low in relation to income. 
And as people tend to sell homes when their incomes rise, it would reward long-term possession: Generally, the government would recapture all or part of the subsidy from a homeowner who sold within 10 years. 

   Among other things, the <ORGANIZATION>GAO</ORGANIZATION> suggested limiting aid to parents over the age of 30. 

   BRIEFS: Just out are reporting requirements for the Social Security tax on employer-paid premiums for group term life insurance; see <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> Notice 88-82. . . . 
The <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> could reduce futile investigations of nonfiling businesses by eliminating duplicate identification numbers, publicizing the need to file quarterly employment-tax returns, and updating its records more accurately with the results of its investigations, the <ORGANIZATION>General Accounting Office</ORGANIZATION> says.

   While her husband was flying <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>
planes during World War II, <PERSON>Bonnie Sparks</PERSON> bought a handicraft kit
for a leather purse to help pass lonely hours in their <LOCATION>New York
City</LOCATION> apartment.
   When <PERSON>Milt Sparks</PERSON> came home, he was intrigued by his wife's
hobby, which he developed a quarter-century later into the business
of making high-quality holsters sought by gun enthusiasts and
police around the world.
   <PERSON>Wiley Clapp</PERSON>, feature editor of Guns and Ammo magazine and owner
of several <PERSON>Milt Sparks Holsters</PERSON>, calls them ``the very, very
best,'' the first choice of many knowledgeable pistol owners.
   ``I'm sure in the days of Stradivarius there were other violin
makers,'' <PERSON>Clapp</PERSON> said. ``But the virtuoso used a Stradivarius.''
   The dirt-road outskirts of this former gold boom town provide a
natural location for <ORGANIZATION>Sparks</ORGANIZATION>' shop. The town's wooden sidewalks
would make an Old West gunslinger feel at home.
   But <PERSON>Sparks</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Wyatt Earps</ORGANIZATION> of yesteryear wouldn't stand a
chance in a modern-day showdown.
   ``I think that any modern pistolero could clean out the OK
Corral before they could get their guns out of their holsters,'' he
said.
   All holsters are not created equal, it seems.
   ``A holster can quite simply be a matter of living or dying,''
said <PERSON>Mike Waidelich</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Bakersfield</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, detective. ``When you
use it 40 hours a week, it needs to be very serviceable. It needs
to be right.''
   Three years ago, Waidelich convinced <LOCATION>Bakersfield</LOCATION>'s 235-member
police force to make the <PERSON>Sparks</PERSON> standard equipment although it cost
about <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> more than the holsters they were using.
   Before strapping on a <LOCATION>Sparks</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Waidelich</PERSON> once had his pistol fall
out of his holster while chasing a suspect. Another time he spent
15 minutes coaxing his weapon out of a poorly designed holster, he
said.
   A Sparks holster is crafted to hold the weapon snugly as an
officer runs or climbs over a fence, but relinquish it when it's
needed, <PERSON>Waidelich</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Tony Kanaley</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sparks</PERSON>' shop manager, estimates that <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of
the company's business is from police officers. Clients also
include such celebrities as <PERSON>Hank Williams Jr.</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar</PERSON>.
   Sparks starts with a stiff piece of vegetable-tanned cowhide.
Kanaley grades and cuts all the leather, and an individual worker
is responsible for finishing the job.
   <PERSON>Sparks</PERSON> said his motto is: ``Do it right.''
   ``Don't sacrifice your integrity to make money,'' he said. ``If
it's not right, if it doesn't save a man's life in a pinch, then
don't do it.''
   In the beginning, satisfaction in a job well done was <PERSON>Sparks</PERSON>'
sole reward. ``Now, I want to make a little money,'' the
72-year-old <PERSON>Sparks</PERSON> said.
   Recently he has been able to leave many day-to-day duties to
<PERSON>Kanaley</PERSON> and his three-person crew, freeing him to travel,
participate in shooting competitions and promote his products.
   Sparks, a former charter pilot and flight instructor, worked
briefly during the late <DATE>1940s</DATE> for a <LOCATION>Boise</LOCATION> belt and holster maker,
but did not become serious about his craft until <DATE>1971</DATE> when a fellow
pilot asked him to make a holster.
   Impressed with the results, the friend convinced him there was a
market for well-made holsters.
   The following year <PERSON>Sparks</PERSON> quit his job as a pilot for the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Bureau of Reclamation</ORGANIZATION> and in <DATE>1973</DATE> moved to <LOCATION>Idaho City</LOCATION>.

<LEADPARA>  SAN FRANCISCO THE trial is over, and Antonio Salieri has been exonerated on

<TEXT>     Leading the orchestra was guest conductor <PERSON>Roger Norrington</PERSON>; appearing as
guest soloist was an exceptional Austrian violinist, <PERSON>Thomas Zehetmair.</PERSON>;    The
30-ish <PERSON>Zehetmair</PERSON> is a newcomer who finds in <ORGANIZATION>Mozart</ORGANIZATION>'s violin concertos
dimensions and shifting moods others only hint at. His playing is, by turns,
playful, profound, serious, seductive, ominous and ironic. His theatricality
-- so apt for a composer such as Mozart -- was grand in the popular Fifth
Concerto. His flair, together with the tones from his "<LOCATION>Falmouth</LOCATION>" Stradivarius,
make these two weeks of concerts (ending <DATE>June 22</DATE>) a must, even for those who
have overdosed on Mozart.;    His playing is also true to often neglected
18th-century conventions: He writes his own tasteful cadenzas or display solos
(avoiding chords), adds ornaments to <PERSON>Mozart</PERSON>'s repeats and even plays along
with the first violins in the orchestral passages.;    As for conductor
<PERSON>Norrington</PERSON>, his "authentic" interpretations of pre-Chopin compositions in past
years have ranged from interesting to infuriating. But this time he hits the
mark squarely and surely.;    To achieve the desired effects, he has radically

brass, splitting the basses right and left, and placing the violins
antiphonally up front. It works; I could hear the basses for the first time in
ages.;    On <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, he remarkably dramatized the little-heard Overture and
<ORGANIZATION>Ballet Music</ORGANIZATION> from the early opera "Idomeneo," though the long crescendo and
big slowdown in the finale struck me as <PERSON>Mozart</PERSON> as reinterpreted in the age of
Beethoven.;    The spirited F Major Divertimento, K. 138, never before played
by the <ORGANIZATION>SFS</ORGANIZATION>, is a work with some brooding and engrossing dark corners, as
energized by Norrington.;    The "Haffner" Symphony (No. 35) also took on new
dimensions in this reading, at least in the absorbing outer movements.
Norrington led it without score or baton until the finale, when he suddenly
produced a baton from nowhere and led the way unerringly through the presto.; 
  As for the Salieri trial, it was a half-hour piece of amateurish theater
prior to the concert, with the ad-libbing <PERSON>Melvin Belli</PERSON> as bewigged judge. The
opposing attorneys -- <PERSON>Weyman Lundquist</PERSON> and <PERSON>William Newsom</PERSON> -- seemed not too
familiar with the script even though they had written it themselves. (<PERSON>Belli</PERSON>

<PERSON>Salieri</PERSON> on a technicality: the lack of any evidence.;    Are we going let
hardened composers like <PERSON>Salieri</PERSON> walk the streets? What about his real crime --
not poison but poison-pen attacks on his rival?;    The jury's still out on

<HEAD>World Record $1.2 Million Paid For Stradivari Cello</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An anonymous bidder paid <MONEY>$1.2 million</MONEY> for a cello
made by <PERSON>Antonio Stradivari</PERSON> about <DATE>1698</DATE> _ a world record auction
price for a musical instrument, the <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s auction house said.
   The cello, known as the <PERSON>Cholmondeley</PERSON> after a previous owner, was
auctioned <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and the seller also asked to remain anonymous.
   The previous record for a musical instrument was <MONEY>$890,000</MONEY> paid
by an anonymous South American in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> on <DATE>March 31</DATE> for a violin
known as the <PERSON>Marie Hall</PERSON> that was also made by <PERSON>Stradivari</PERSON>, an
Italian.
   The previous record for a cello was <MONEY>$393,000</MONEY> paid in <DATE>1984</DATE> by
<PERSON>Robert Cohen</PERSON>, an eminent <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> cellist, for a Stradivari
instrument known as the Bonjour.
   Sotheby's said several people were bidding for the <ORGANIZATION>Cholmondeley</ORGANIZATION>
``in a relaxed way.'' They said they were not surprised by the
price as they had expected the cello to sell for at least <MONEY>$1
million</MONEY>.
   They said the buyer might decide at some time to disclose his or
her identity.
   British cellist <PERSON>Julian Lloyd Webber</PERSON>, younger brother of composer
<PERSON>Andrew Lloyd Webber</PERSON>, spent <MONEY>$280,000</MONEY> in <DATE>1986</DATE> on a Stradivari cello
and was not immediately identified as the purchaser.
   ``The <PERSON>Cholmondeley</PERSON> (pronounced Chumley) is so well made that it
almost plays itself _ as if it had cruise control,'' said <PERSON>Adam
Watson</PERSON>, the cataloguer of <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s auction.
   The cello has a head by a different maker, Joannnes Florenus
Guidantus. The instrument is just over 29 inches long and rich
golden-brown in color.
   It belonged in the mid-19th century to the <ORGANIZATION>Marquess of
Cholmondeley</ORGANIZATION>. It later went to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and was played at
the <PERSON>Stradivari</PERSON> memorial concert in <DATE>1937</DATE> by <PERSON>Ralph Oxman</PERSON>.
   ``It is a well-known instrument and has been in the hands of
several collectors recently,'' said <PERSON>Watson</PERSON>.

   DALLAS -- Visitors to the Mandolin Brothers' booth at the
recent Greater Southwest Guitar Show found an eye-popping
price tag hanging from one instrument. "OK, so it's
$100,000," read a sign the Staten Island, N.Y., dealer had
placed nearby. "Go find another one."
   That would be hard to do. The rare 1958 Gibson "Flying V"
was one of only 81 shipped the year it was built. Amid a
recession that has driven down prices for Impressionist
paintings and folk art as well as many collectibles, vintage
guitars are hot -- especially those used by vintage rock 'n'
roll stars.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At a <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> auction last year, <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's Holdings Inc.</ORGANIZATION>
sold a <DATE>1968</DATE> Fender Stratocaster used at <LOCATION>Woodstock</LOCATION> by <LOCATION>Jimi
Hendrix</LOCATION> for <MONEY>$334,000</MONEY> -- nearly four times the expected price.
And actor <PERSON>Gary Busey</PERSON>, who portrayed <ORGANIZATION>Buddy Holly</ORGANIZATION> in a movie,
recently paid <MONEY>$242,000</MONEY> at a <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s auction in this country
for a <DATE>1945</DATE> Gibson J-45 acoustic once owned by the late
rocker.
   In <DATE>1989</DATE>, an unidentified buyer even paid <MONEY>$1,300</MONEY> for a
fragment of a guitar smashed by rock guitarist <PERSON>Pete Townshend</PERSON>
of the Who. "The guitar market has gone berserk," says
<LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION> guitar dealer <PERSON>George Gruhn</PERSON>, also a columnist for
Guitar Player magazine.
   Some industry publications have begun tracking prices
monthly, and major manufacturers such as <ORGANIZATION>Gibson Guitar Corp.</ORGANIZATION>
of <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Fender Musical Instruments Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Brea</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, are building high-priced "reissues" of their own
classics. <PERSON>Gibson</PERSON>'s <DATE>1959</DATE> Les <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> reissues, named for the
legendary guitarist who originally designed the model, sell
for as much as <MONEY>$4,199</MONEY>, compared with about <MONEY>$1,699</MONEY> for a
similar new model.
   The original pre-1960 <ORGANIZATION>Gibson Les Paul</ORGANIZATION> models regularly
sell for more than <MONEY>$20,000</MONEY>. And rare prewar Martin D-45
acoustics are going for as much as <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> -- nearly
quintuple the top price of just five years ago. Still, these
prices don't come near the cost of a Stradivarius; one of the
violins sold for <MONEY>$1.7 million</MONEY> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> <DATE>last November</DATE>.
   The vintage guitar boom is being spurred on, in part, by
aging baby boomers seeking to recapture a piece of their
past. "We've got money to spend, and guitars, banjos and
fretted instruments are the instruments of our youth," says
<PERSON>Kerry Keane</PERSON>, a musical instrument appraiser for <ORGANIZATION>Skinner Inc.</ORGANIZATION>,
an auction house based in <LOCATION>Bolton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>.
   As with most collecting fads, though, fortune hunters
should beware. Like cars, most used guitars still sell for
far less than they cost new, and dealers -- who pay top
dollar only for mint-condition guitars -- complain that many
would-be sellers expect any battered instruments they drag in
to be worth a small fortune.
   Moreover, with prices skyrocketing, guitar counterfeiters
are altering serial numbers and name plates, modifying
cheaper models, and even making pseudovintage instruments
from scratch. Some dealers now dismantle instruments before
buying to check for original paint, wiring and hardware.
"There is no such thing as a perfect forgery," says <ORGANIZATION>Mandolin
Brothers President Stanley Jay</ORGANIZATION>.
   As in so many other collecting areas, prices of vintage
guitars are being driven up by free-spending foreign
collectors and dealers. Many of them are Japanese, who prize
the American-made instruments for their tone, craftsmanship
and continuing status as the choice of most international
recording artists.
   Many <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> guitar dealers send their inventory lists
directly to foreign collectors and dealers, despite grumbling
from some musicians and dealers about the number of vintage
instruments leaving this country. While industry figures are
hard to come by in a largely cash-and-carry business, some
dealers say foreign buyers account for as much as <PERCENT>75%</PERCENT> of
their vintage sales.
   Overseas buyers have even hired <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> "brokers" to scour
pawnshops and newspaper want ads. "They're out in the
heartland looking for these guitars," says <PERSON>Mark Pollack</PERSON>, of
<LOCATION>Charley</LOCATION>'s Guitar Shop here.
   High-bidding Japanese buyers have become fixtures at the
growing number of guitar shows, which is why <PERSON>Mr. Pollack</PERSON> made
sure he had a Japanese-speaking employee in his booth at the
recent <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> show, the largest of its kind. Japanese
investors have been known to buy instruments by the truckload
for shipment back to their country, where even mass-produced
workhorses like 1970s-vintage Fender Stratocasters are
selling for as much as <MONEY>$2,500</MONEY> -- nearly three times the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
price.
   "Mostly, it's the sound," says collector <PERSON>Mac Yasuda</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Newport Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, an executive with <ORGANIZATION>Tsumura &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a
large Tokyo-based manufacturer of pharmaceuticals and bath
additives. With the help of a toll-free <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> telephone
number, <PERSON>Mr. Yasuda</PERSON> buys instruments for both himself and
company President <PERSON>Akira Tsumura</PERSON>, who recently opened a <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>
museum to display his huge collection. <PERSON>Mr. Yasuda</PERSON>'s own
collection includes 50 <PERSON>Gibson</PERSON> J-200 acoustic guitars, 15
vintage <ORGANIZATION>Gibson Les Pauls</ORGANIZATION>, and seven out of the 91 D-45
acoustics made by <ORGANIZATION>C.F. Martin Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Nazareth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, before
World War II.
   A variety of factors make some guitars worth more than
others. Rarities such as the prewar D-45s -- first made for
cowboy crooner Gene Autry -- and the elegant jazz guitars
handmade by the late <PERSON>John D'Angelico</PERSON> have long been prized
for their tone and craftsmanship.
   Collectors seek out certain early Les Paul models because
of the "flame" patterns in the curly maple wood used to make
them. And the <ORGANIZATION>Fender Stratocasters</ORGANIZATION>' mystique is due largely
to their use by rock stars such as <LOCATION>Jimi Hendrix</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Eric
Clapton</PERSON>.
   Meanwhile, a small but growing nostalgia market has
developed for some instruments that never had much snob
appeal. Dealers say baby boomers, apparently recalling the
first budget-priced instruments that their parents bought
them, are paying as much as <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> for Danelectro electric
guitars once sold in <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Roebuck &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION> catalogs for <MONEY>$59</MONEY>
and up.
   <PERSON>Dominick Montuoro</PERSON>, a disabled <LOCATION>New Rochelle</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>,
construction worker, began collecting them after playing one
that belonged to a friend's son. "I just fell in love with
it," says <PERSON>Mr. Montuoro</PERSON>, who now has 90 of the homely
instruments, which feature Masonite tops with pickups, a
piece of electronic hardware, made from modified lipstick
tubes.
   With prices for many vintage guitars rising and falling on
such quirky factors as which model certain rockers used on
their last tour, appraisers caution that vintage guitars are
not for investors seeking huge profits. "For the most part,
it's a slow, steady increase," says <PERSON>Mr. Keane</PERSON>, the instrument
appraiser.
   Moreover, veteran dealers like <PERSON>Mr. Gruhn</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION> warn
that prices could plummet if economic troubles beset <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>
or <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. "If anything happens to reduce foreign demand, this
market will react as though it were struck in the solar
plexis," he says.
   Some professional musicians wouldn't mind seeing that
happen. "It's outrageous," says <ORGANIZATION>Warner Brothers</ORGANIZATION> recording
artist Ry Cooder, who attended one guitar show a few years
ago, but "crawled out" when he saw the prices. To musicians,
a guitar is a tool, says <PERSON>Mr. Cooder</PERSON>, adding that "a carpenter
wouldn't pay <MONEY>$100</MONEY> for a hammer."

<HEAD>Sword, Rare Violins Among Stolen Antiques Found</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators say they have recovered more
than <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> in stolen antiques _ including two centuries-old
violins and a sword reportedly used by Civil War General <PERSON>William T.
Sherman</PERSON>.
   The merchandise, which also included books, coin collections,
toy cars and guns, was found <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in a storage locker.
   ``We're saying half-a-million dollars right now, but that's
probably a very conservative estimate,'' said <PERSON>Dennis Palmentera</PERSON>, an
investigator with the <ORGANIZATION>Ohio Organized Crime Investigation Commission</ORGANIZATION>.
   Police have arrested 29 people since a grand jury in <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, returned secret indictments <DATE>Jan. 2</DATE> in connection with an
Ohio-based burglary ring, but no arrests have been made involving
the <LOCATION>Savannah</LOCATION> cache.
   Investigators say the ring has operated for 20 years and is
blamed for more than <MONEY>$1.8 million</MONEY> in thefts over five years.
   ``The ring had fingered out from <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Harold Crabtree</PERSON>,
also an investigator with the <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> task force. ``It spread from
<LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and was in every state in between.''
   The Sherman-related items, which included a portrait of the
<ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> general, were stolen from <PERSON>Sherman</PERSON>'s birthplace museum in
<LOCATION>Lancaster</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, investigators said.
   The violins were believed made by <PERSON>Antonio Stradivari</PERSON>, the famous
Italian craftsman.
   Palmentera said investigators believe the antiques stashed in
<LOCATION>Savannah</LOCATION> were destined for a major antiques show in <LOCATION>Norcross</LOCATION>.
   ``They store it for six months or a year until it cools off,
then they'd sell it,'' <PERSON>Palmentera</PERSON> said. ``They sell it in the major
shows because this stuff is hard to track.''

HOSPITAL THRIFT SHOP IS NEXT TO NONE; 
</P>
<P>
BIRTHDAYS: NEXT-TO-NEW AND ITS VOLUNTEER STAFF CELEBRATE 30 YEARS OF BARGAINS. 
THE STORE HAS GENERATED ABOUT $1 MILLION FOR GLENDALE MEMORIAL.

<P>
Thrift shops have always been known for having unusual merchandise at low 
prices, but this month, the Next-to-New Shop in <LOCATION>Glendale</LOCATION> is adding a new 
feature to its lore: longevity. 
</P>
<P>
The shop at 210 <ORGANIZATION>E. Broadway</ORGANIZATION> is turning 30. It was opened in <DATE>1960</DATE> by the 
<ORGANIZATION>Glendale Memorial Hospital Guild of Volunteers</ORGANIZATION> to generate income for hospital 
projects. In its 30 years, the shop has contributed about <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> to the 
hospital, spokesman <PERSON>Bryan Bishop</PERSON> said. Last year, the store made about <MONEY>$38,000</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
Next-to-New has been managed over the years by many volunteers, most of them 
women. But today, it is the domain of <PERSON>Alex Arszno</PERSON>, serving his second one-year 
term as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Arszno, 76, is a <LOCATION>Glendale</LOCATION> resident and lives just a few blocks from the shop. 
He comes in every morning before it opens to arrange the merchandise and tidy 
up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He only works <DATE>Saturdays</DATE> but drops in every afternoon just to make sure all is 
going smoothly. Even on <DATE>Sundays</DATE>, when the shop is closed, Arszno comes in to 
check the inventory. 
</P>
<P>
The store sells clothing, shoes, appliances, costume jewelry and an assortment 
of knickknacks. Clothing is its biggest seller, but it has had its share of 
unusual items such as antiques and musical instruments, said <PERSON>Ila May Nyquist</PERSON>, a 
charter member of the guild. 
</P>
<P>
Nyquist has been with the shop since it opened and said that among the objects 
that have come through the store and brought in the most money are musical 
instruments. 
</P>
<P>
"Once we had a violin. It wasn't a Stradivarius, but we got quite a bit of 
money for it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Arszno donated a Yugoslavian accordion, which he had kept since 
immigrating from <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, where he was a prisoner during World War II. It went 
on sale for <MONEY>$75</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
"It stayed in my closet for a long time," he said. "I never play, so I gave it 
away." 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, customers come from film studios and theater costume shops 
looking for older or unusual clothing to be used in their productions. 
</P>
<P>
More common are those who need to stretch their dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"We get young people that want to furnish an apartment," volunteer <PERSON>Dorothy 
Baillie</PERSON> said. "Fifty dollars buys lots of stuff here." 
</P>
<P>
Arszno said he occasionally lowers prices for those who cannot afford what they 
want. Everyone wins, he said, because the customer can take the merchandise, 
and the store has made a sale. 
</P>
<P>
Arszno exhorts the other volunteers, who number more than 30 and are mostly 
senior citizens, to enjoy their work as much as he does. 
</P>
<P>
"I say, 'Be happy. It is our last job. We go from here to Forest Lawn,' " 
<PERSON>Arszno</PERSON> said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
When he retired after 27 years of working, most recently in shipping and 
receiving, Arszno took ceramics classes but found he wanted more activity. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to the hospital, and they say, '<PERSON>Alex</PERSON>, we can keep you here,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
He became a volunteer with the guild in <DATE>1980</DATE>, and they sent him to the thrift 
shop, where he has been ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, <PERSON>Arszno</PERSON> has had to deal with shoplifters on occasion and has 
caught a few red-handed. But he handles problems with a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
Once he caught a young man trying to take a pair of pants by putting them over 
his own pants, <PERSON>Arszno</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Next time you wear bigger pants and then put the others under yours,' 
" he said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Arszno credits simple friendliness with the store's success. 
</P>
<P>
"When you like people, they notice. The face shows when you like them," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the hospital has used the proceeds from the Next-to-New Shop 
for improvements such as the purchase of a <MONEY>$90,000</MONEY> mammography machine, 
spokesman <PERSON>Bishop</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's contribution went into the hospital's new Heart and <ORGANIZATION>Emergency 
Center</ORGANIZATION>, which is currently under construction, <PERSON>Bishop</PERSON> said. The guild has 
pledged to contribute <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> over the next five years for the new facility. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the shop's 30th anniversary, the shop will have an open house <DATE>today 
from 10 a.m.</DATE> to <TIME>4 p.m.</TIME> and a reunion of past presidents of the guild. 
</P>
<P>
The Next-to-New Shop is open <DATE>Monday</DATE> through <DATE>Saturday from 10 a.m.</DATE> to <TIME>4 p.m.</TIME>

Feting Slava and His 'Wooden Wife'

By Heidi Waleson</HL>
<DD> 02/23/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Up close and personal, <PERSON>Mstislav Rostropovich</PERSON> seems a little shy and frail, wisps of white hair clinging to his head as he walks slowly, almost timidly, onto the <ORGANIZATION>Carnegie Hall</ORGANIZATION> stage to conduct the <ORGANIZATION>National Symphony</ORGANIZATION> in a brief rehearsal before the <TIME>8 p.m.</TIME> concert. 

   He looks closer to 70, but <DATE>March 27</DATE> is his 60th birthday, and his management has organized a marathon birthday celebration for him here: 18 concerts between <DATE>Feb. 6</DATE> and <DATE>March 24</DATE>, including 10 different programs, 15 cello concertos, two solo recitals of <LOCATION>Bach</LOCATION> suites and three programs for which he is conductor, including the War Requiem of <PERSON>Benjamin Britten</PERSON> with the <LOCATION>New York Philharmonic</LOCATION> and his wife, soprano <PERSON>Galina Vishnevskaya</PERSON>, as one of the soloists. 

   All this will be capped by a gala at the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> on the birthday itself. 
Among the onstage revellers: <PERSON>Leonard Bernstein</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jean-Pierre Rampal</PERSON>, <PERSON>Isaac Stern</PERSON>, <PERSON>Yehudi Menuhin</PERSON>. 

   One of the effects of all this mellifluous frenzy will be to allay any suspicions that "Slava" <PERSON>Rostropovich</PERSON>, one of the world's most celebrated cellists, is thinking about giving up his instrument for conducting, now that he has been music director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Symphony</ORGANIZATION> for 10 years, and is recording operas. 
Forget it. 
The "wooden wife," as he calls his Stradivarius, is not about to become a silent partner. 

   Cellist, pianist, conductor <PERSON>Rostropovich</PERSON> says that he is a "musician" first. 
He talks fast, starting off in English, then falling into Russian, then back again. 
Is he a cellist by accident? 
"I am a human being by accident! 
The result of love between my mother and father! 
My father gave me a cello and said 'Play.' 
If he had given me a violin, I probably would have tried to play the violin. 
But I'm happy I play the cello. 
I love the instrument very much." 

   The first pair of concerts, with the <ORGANIZATION>National Symphony</ORGANIZATION>, had <PERSON>Mr. Rostropovich</PERSON> conducting the first evening and playing three cello concertos the next. 
<PERSON>Hugh Wolf</PERSON>, his conducting protege and now music director of the <ORGANIZATION>New Jersey Symphony</ORGANIZATION>, did the conducting honors on the <TIME>second night</TIME>. 
It was a mix of the familiar and the unfamiliar, as are most of the rest of these programs: the war horse <ORGANIZATION>Schumann Cello Concerto</ORGANIZATION> in A minor, with its hazardous pianissimo balances between cello and orchestra; <ORGANIZATION>Bloch</ORGANIZATION>'s schmaltzy Schelomo, which gave <PERSON>Mr. Rostropovich</PERSON> the opportunity to emote in long lines and to emit powerful, growling low notes. 

   Both orchestra and soloist sounded tentative in the beginning of the <LOCATION>Schumann</LOCATION>; more expansive by its slow middle movement. 
Still, for the first half of the program <PERSON>Mr. Rostropovich</PERSON> seemed to be on automatic pilot. 

   Not so for the second half, <PERSON>Henri Dutilleux</PERSON>'s "Tout un Monde Lointain." 
This imagistic, very French score took off with <PERSON>Mr. Rostropovich</PERSON> showing off all the cello's incarnations: the very high register, the double stops, the long singing notes. 
And the orchestra went from the mysterious eccentricities of the opening to the colors dissolving into cacophony at the end. 
It was a thrill, and everyone in the audience felt it. 
<PERSON>Mr. Rostropovich</PERSON> practically dragged the composer up onto the stage for a bow. 

   Let that be a lesson to the orchestra managers who insist on the standard repertoire when they engage <PERSON>Mr. Rostropovich</PERSON> -- and that's most of them. 
He won't admit that he's bored with the standard cello rep -- <PERSON>Dvorak</PERSON>, <PERSON>Strauss</PERSON>, Tchaikovsky -- but it sure sounds like it. 
"When orchestras invite for the Dvorak concerto, the concert hall is immediately sold out. 
Also some conductors like, in rehearsal, to spend time on the symphony, not the accompaniment for cello. 
Dvorak is much easier than a new piece." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Rostropovich</PERSON> has their number, however. 
"I'm going to make a new condition. 
When I go to play, I will play one new piece and one classical." 
Will the orchestras agree? 
"I don't know. 
But I have many engagements, so I have choices." 

   For his own party, however, <PERSON>Mr. Rostropovich</PERSON> has decided what the music is going to be, and maybe all those orchestra managers should come and check it out. 
The cello concertos include the Penderecki No. 2 (<DATE>1982</DATE>), the <PERSON>Lutoslawski</PERSON> (<DATE>1970</DATE>) and the <PERSON>Dutilleux</PERSON> (<DATE>1970</DATE>), all of which were dedicated to him, and which he has never before played in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. (The latter two can be heard on Angel S-37146; <PERSON>Mr. Rostropovich</PERSON> has recorded most of the standard repertoire for cello, and a fair amount of Russian symphonic music -- as a conductor, too.) 

   There are works by his friends <ORGANIZATION>Prokofiev</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Shostakovich</PERSON> and <PERSON>Britten</PERSON>, also dedicated to him. 
And there is "Three Meditations for Mass," arranged especially for <PERSON>Mr. Rostropovich</PERSON> by his friend <PERSON>Mr. Bernstein</PERSON>, who was instrumental in getting him out of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> back in <DATE>1974</DATE>. 
That was after the Soviet government had derailed the cellist's career, because of a letter he wrote in defense of Alexander Solzhenitsyn. 

   "They are pieces that are representative of different times in my life, " <PERSON>Mr. Rostropovich</PERSON> says. 

   Except for the <LOCATION>Penderecki</LOCATION>, he plans to play all the cello pieces from memory. 
"I have never worked as hard or as much on the cello as I have in this period. 
The <PERSON>Dutilleux</PERSON> is extremely difficult, and I didn't make any mistakes there!" he says proudly. 
"The Britten cello symphony I haven't played for 20 years, so it is like a new composition. 
And after 20 years, I see other sides of the piece." 

   And after 13 years in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Rostropovich</PERSON> has plenty of money, too, including a hefty income (<MONEY>$606,250</MONEY> in <DATE>1984-85</DATE> for his labors for the debt-ridden <ORGANIZATION>National Symphony</ORGANIZATION>; and, reportedly, one of the world's higher soloist fees). 
He divides his engagements -- between 100 and 140 a year -- equally between cello playing and conducting. 
Ensconced at the orchestra in <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> (although he actually lives in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> and travels on a Swiss passport), he is a symbol of American moral superiority on the issue of human rights. 
Fortunately, he's also a pretty fair conductor, as his new recording of Tchaikovsky's opera "Yolanta" on Erato attests. 

   As for going back to visit the country that stripped him and his wife of their citizenship in <DATE>1978</DATE>, he says he hasn't been officially invited, as some other Soviet emigre artists have, and isn't sure what he'd do if he were. 

   Perhaps <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON> doesn't want to interrupt the superb job <PERSON>Mr. Rostropovich</PERSON> is doing as an interpreter of Shostakovich to Western ears, both in music and in words. 
"Shostakovich," he says, jumping happily into a favorite topic, "is our contemporary composer; he is speaking about our life, all our emotion, stress, deep depression, emotional explosion; that's the music of <ORGANIZATION>Shostakovich</ORGANIZATION>. 
It's a mirror of us." 

   It definitely looks as if there will be more work for <PERSON>Mr. Rostropovich</PERSON>'s wooden wife after the birthday fuss is over. 
The non-wooden wife, he says, "is not jealous."

<DESCRIPT>  MUSIC; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  PLAYING a Fender guitar is somewhat like driving a very powerful car,
preferably American-made -- perhaps a 1967 Corvette.;    In the case of the
three-pickup Stratocaster model, you find that this sculpted piece of wood
with two curved teeth by the fingerboard -- an instrument built for Batman --
fits the human body surprisingly well. After you've plugged it into an
amplifier (perhaps a Fender Twin Reverb from the late '60s), you suddenly are
capable of producing the most alarming . . . sound.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  LEO FENDER, MUSIC MAKER
THE ENGINEER OF ROCK 'N' ROLL  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Pop Music  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Such was the legacy of <PERSON>Clarence Leo Fender</PERSON>, the force behind one of the
century's enduring American artifacts -- the solid-body electric guitar. If
rock 'n' roll was invented by <PERSON>Robert Johnson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Elvis Presley</PERSON> and <PERSON>Little
Richard</PERSON>, it was Fender and his company who launched the music's true machine.;
   Purists will argue that Fender, a <ORGANIZATION>Fullerton</ORGANIZATION> resident who died last month at
82, was not the first to make such a device. Claims are made for the
Rickenbacker company, and for the remarkable <PERSON>Les Paul</PERSON>, who also produced music
from a solid piece of wood in the <DATE>1940s</DATE> (eventually manufactured by <ORGANIZATION>Fender</ORGANIZATION>'s
American arch-rival, the <ORGANIZATION>Gibson Corp.</ORGANIZATION>). Acoustic guitars had been electrified
for jazz since the <DATE>1930s</DATE>, and perhaps before.;    It was Fender's genius,
though, to mass-produce the solid-wood design that not only made the raucous,
reverberating sounds of rock, but also managed to look the part.;    Like
<PERSON>Levi</PERSON>'s and <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>Stratocaster</LOCATION> and its more basic cousin, the
Telecaster swept the world in the early '50s. Both have since been copied and
recopied by just about every guitar maker from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>. But if
their design can be found everywhere, nothing has quite duplicated the spirit
of the originals.;    <PERSON>Tom Wheeler</PERSON>, in his encyclopedic book "American
Guitars," perfectly catches their visual audacity: "Fender guitars were rock
and roll, jet-age, outrageous. They were as futuristic as <LOCATION>Sputnik</LOCATION>, or as tacky
as all the sequins in <PERSON>Webb Pierce</PERSON>'s wardrobe, depending on your point of view.
Before Fender, there were no turquoise musical instruments, no Candy Apple
Red, scoop-body dragsters with gold-plated hardware and white plastic knobs.";
   <ORGANIZATION>Fender</ORGANIZATION>'s creations became not only the sound of rock 'n' roll, but its
history. Such artists as <LOCATION>Jimi Hendrix</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Buddy Holly</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Eric Clapton</PERSON> became
inseparable from their Stratocasters (and, in some cases, from their onstage
demolition of them.);    Inevitably, anyone who admired these Strat players
(or Telecaster players such as <PERSON>Bruce Springsteen</PERSON>, <PERSON>Keith Richards</PERSON> and <PERSON>Danny
Gatton</PERSON>) would want to own such odd-looking, interesting instruments -- and
would treasure them.;    It is a wonderful aural coincidence that the words
Strad and Strat sound so much alike: A violinist will talk about his
Stradivarius with the same reverence that a rock guitarist will speak about
his Stratocaster.;    The father of the Strat was no great fan of rock.
Rather, <ORGANIZATION>Fender</ORGANIZATION> was fascinated by the way you could get sounds by placing
magnets under the metal strings of guitars.;    He experimented with coils of
different sizes and impedances -- more intrigued, perhaps, by capacitors than
by harmonies. He held dozens of patents, and so much attention was lavished on
his guitars that one could overlook the fact he made the world's first
electric bass in <DATE>1951</DATE> -- an instrument that also changed pop music forever.;  
 With astounding understatement, he once said, "I never had too much feeling
for the acoustic guitars. I had always felt that the guitar could do a much
better job if it wasn't limited by the properties of that vibrating top.";   
For him, the combinations of sound, once you were freed from the acoustic
limit, seemed infinite. With a revolutionary three pickups (the Stratocaster
version; <ORGANIZATION>Telecasters</ORGANIZATION> had only two) and the proper amplifier, musicians could
fill a large room. With enough amplification, they would discover soon enough,
their devices could fill a stadium.;    But even a beginner learns that with a
little experimentation, a mere flick of the wrist, the Fender sound can be
sustained, or vibrated -- and cranked up. It can be turned into Hendrix-like
feedback or <PERSON>Stevie Ray Vaughan-like</PERSON> blues or the <LOCATION>B.B.</LOCATION> King-like solos on those
Rolling Stones albums.;    This is not a guitar for "<PERSON>Michael</PERSON>, Row the Boat
Ashore." Even on the first test drive, you can imagine it assaulting <LOCATION>Jericho</LOCATION>'s
walls.;    In time, caught in the entropy of our century, things went
downhill. Fender sold the company to <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1965</DATE>, and since then connoisseurs
of Strats and Teles have looked for the phrase "pre-CBS" whenever one was
sold.;    Guitars that were traded routinely for under <MONEY>$200</MONEY> in the <DATE>1950s</DATE> and
early <DATE>1960s</DATE> suddenly were going for thousands.;    "Fender Stratocaster, <DATE>1957</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>Sunburst</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Been Through Hell</ORGANIZATION>. <MONEY>$5,000</MONEY>" is still a typical advertisement.
Eventually, the unthinkable happened: Fenders were made in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. Some still
are, although the company's present owners again are making them in the <LOCATION>United
States.</LOCATION>;    Fender himself, the man <PERSON>Wheeler</PERSON> calls the "<PERSON>Henry Ford</PERSON> of electric
guitars," continued to build them. He founded <ORGANIZATION>G &amp; L Musical Products</ORGANIZATION>, and many
G &amp; L instruments are much prized.;    By most accounts, <PERSON>Fender</PERSON> was outwardly
the perfect nerd, absorbed by mechanical things until the end. "He rarely
wears a suit, and he's almost never without his little leather holster full of
screwdrivers," said a long-ago profile in Guitar Player. "In his shirt, he
keeps a plastic pocket protector stuffed with pens, pencils and a metal
ruler.";    He never learned to play the guitar. (box)  </TEXT>

   ``Popular Songs and Irish Ballads'' (EMI) _ <PERSON>John McCormack
   
   John McCormack</PERSON> made his opera and recording debut in <DATE>1904</DATE> at age
21. He left the opera stage <DATE>19 years later</DATE> but continued making
records and recital appearances for two more decades. Along the
way, he became one of the concert world's first true superstars, a
stage idol who collected million-dollar salaries, race horses,
homes and old master paintings, but who never lost his feel for the
popular music his concert audiences loved.
   This son of <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>, though a terrible opera actor, was a
tremendous artist whose vocal glory was renowned. It was the great
violinist <PERSON>Fritz Kreisler</PERSON>, or in some versions <PERSON>Jan Kubelik</PERSON>, who said
<PERSON>McCormack</PERSON> had a Stradivarius in his throat. Sounds, beautiful
sounds, poured out effortlessly.
   This <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> rerelease under the series ``Great Recordings of the
Century'' (an odd title, since records haven't been made in any
other century) presents the songs that his mass public loved, and
that <PERSON>McCormack</PERSON> loved to sing. They range from <DATE>1930</DATE> to <DATE>1941</DATE>, with
one from <DATE>1908</DATE>. The incomparable accompanist <PERSON>Gerald Moore</PERSON> appears on
11 tracks.
   The listener must have a bent for Irish ballads, or surrender
him or herself to the period sentimentality of the music, to enjoy
this disc. If either is the case, it can only delight.
   The extremely generous program _ 23 songs at 73:03 _ gives the
range of the popular-music <PERSON>McCormack</PERSON>. ``The Garden Where the
Praties Grow'' is a typical, light-hearted ditty of the Old Sod.
<PERSON>McCormack</PERSON> sings a melancholy ballad of parting in ``<PERSON>Terence</PERSON>'s
Farewell to <PERSON>Kathleen</PERSON>.'' In the charming ``Off to <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>,''
the tenor is the happy-go-lucky immigrant who ``lately took the
notion for to cross the briny ocean.''
   A more perfect interpretation of ``Jeanie With the Light Brown
Hair'' could not be imagined. McCormack's voice here resembles a
line from this favorite: ``floating like a vapor on the soft <DATE>summer</DATE>
air.''
   A sad story about <PERSON>McCormack</PERSON>, who died in <DATE>1945</DATE>, is told by <PERSON>Henry
Pleasants</PERSON> in his book ``The Great Singers'': ``Towards the end of
his life, when nothing but the records was left, he would play them
again and again, exclaiming happily, and a bit wistfully _ possibly
a bit incredulously: `I was a damned good singer, wasn't I?'''
   He was. Even in the recordings made in his mid-50s, the timeless
<PERSON>McCormack</PERSON> sounds like a brave lad about to step ashore in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>,
or the young wooer of a sweet colleen.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Portrait by Rembrandt expected to reach Pounds 3m: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD <PERSON>Rosebery</PERSON> is disposing of one of the most important paintings in his
collection to raise money to repair his family's stately home in <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>.
The painting, a portrait of the religious reformer <PERSON>Johannes Uyttenbogaert</PERSON>,
is regarded as one of the finest privately-owned Rembrandts in the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>. It is
expected to fetch Pounds 3m when auctioned at <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s on <DATE>July 8</DATE>.
The painting came to the <PERSON>Rosebery</PERSON> family in the <DATE>19th century</DATE> when the 5th
Earl married into the <LOCATION>Rothschilds</LOCATION>, who had acquired the work a generation
earlier. It originally hung in <ORGANIZATION>Mentmore Towers</ORGANIZATION>, the Victorian mansion which
<ORGANIZATION>Lord Rosebery</ORGANIZATION> sold with its contents in <DATE>1977</DATE>. The appearance on the market
of this important <ORGANIZATION>Rembrandt</ORGANIZATION>, with the strong possibility that it will sell
to a foreign buyer, will intensify fears that the national heritage is
disappearing abroad with increasing frequency.
The possibility of a Conservative government issuing a list of treasures
that cannot be exported, or of a Labour government increasing the tax burden
of the very rich, is believed to be behind the appearance on the market of
several Old Masters in recent weeks. On <DATE>April 15 Christie</DATE>'s hopes to sell
another work by Rembrandt as well as paintings by <PERSON>Holbein</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Canaletto</ORGANIZATION>.
A cello made by <PERSON>Stradivari</PERSON> in about <DATE>1690</DATE> and owned by the British virtuoso
<PERSON>Robert Cohen</PERSON> sold for Pounds 605,000 at <ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s yesterday to a musician
who remained anonymous.
The price was at the low end of the estimate. Known as the 'Bonjour', the
instrument is considered to be one of the most important cellos to reach the
market in recent years. A <PERSON>Stradivari</PERSON> violin known as the <PERSON>Schreiber</PERSON> and once
loaned to <PERSON>Pinchas Zukerman</PERSON>, the violinist, sold at the top of its estimate
for Pounds 352,000. It also went to a musician.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Arts: A candle-lit gala and student workshop - Music in
Italy / Palladio provides the venue for Paul Driver while in Ischia David
Murray enjoys opera and exotic plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER and DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE <PERSON>Euganean Hills</PERSON> lies the little town of Bagnolo di Lonigo, and hard
by, but not so very easy for even a seasoned coach-driver to find, one of
<PERSON>Andrea Palladio</PERSON>'s earliest villas, built between <DATE>1542</DATE> and <DATE>1544</DATE> for the most
powerful family on the Veneto mainland, the Pisanis. It is not to be
confused with the celebrated, sublimely palatial <PERSON>Pisani</PERSON> residence on the
<ORGANIZATION>Brenta Canal</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Stra</LOCATION>. The Lonigo property is by comparison a bluffly
domestic proposition, a cubical construction with rusticated triple arch
entrance. The <LOCATION>River Gua</LOCATION>, hedged off, flows past the doorstep.
Alone of Palladian villas, this one has remained with the family for which
it was designed, but until recently has been mouldering in disuse. Now the
present owner, <PERSON>Marchesa Lepri</PERSON>, has seen to an accurate restoration of the
building and the 16th century frescoes (by an unknown artist) which adorn
its fine central sala. The Queen Mother paid a visit there a couple of years
ago, and the public has at last been let in, albeit paying some Pounds 200
for the privilege.
The occasion was a gala concert given in aid of the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION>' 'Decade
of the Disabled', the second (sponsored by <ORGANIZATION>Tamoil</ORGANIZATION>) in a series of annual
events under the artistic direction of the violinist <PERSON>Andrea Cappelletti</PERSON> and
named 'The Lost Palaces of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>' in reference to the public
inaccessibility of its chosen venues. The villa proved difficult of access
in the purely physical sense - no outing, this, for the disabled - but if it
could not quite count as a palace, it certainly offered an image of magical
resplendency, candle-lit as it was in the balmy twilight at the head of a
great sweep of candle-lit lawn. From the point on the lawn at which we had
scramblingly entered, the refurbished, illuminated frescoes were already -
and breathtakingly - visible through the semi-circular 'thermal' window of
the sala.
That room proved to be of more than domestic size and consequence - an
interestingly cruciform and barrel vaulted structure, whose frescoes seen
close-to were charming but no more, and whose acoustics were awkwardly
reverberant. The concert suffered also from poor lighting, except when made
periodically over-bright by the television crews. But the audience was there
as much for the sense of place and the anticipation of a handsome candle-lit
supper as for the concert itself, which, by a familiar law of the gala
event, became something that might almost have been left out.
Nevertheless, it made its plea. The young players, notable for eager
sonorous freshness rather than finesse, of <PERSON>Interpreti Veneziani</PERSON> and their
conductor <PERSON>Paolo Cognolato</PERSON> gave us a brashly arresting <ORGANIZATION>Rossini</ORGANIZATION> overture - <PERSON>Il
Signor Bruschino</PERSON> - and accompanied <PERSON>Signor Cappelletti</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Mozart</LOCATION>'s A major
concerto, K. 219. He produced a lustrous stream of sound from his <DATE>1727</DATE>
Stradivarius, the instrument's historical interest and great price nicely
fitting in with the tone of the <TIME>evening</TIME>. Finally came <PERSON>Domenico Cimarosa</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Il
Maestro di Cappella</ORGANIZATION> (1791), a little one-act lampoon of the conductor's
role, and effectively the first-ever young person's guide to the orchestra.
Baritone <PERSON>Maurizio Muraro</PERSON>, costumed in brocade, goaded and cajoled his unruly
musicians and skilfully entertained us. Then followed a couple of not too
long speeches - and a shimmering supper.
MORTELLA means 'myrtle', which as a name for the late Sir <PERSON>William Walton</PERSON>'s
garden-estate on Ischia is a kind of joke. There is myrtle, along with other
<LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION> natives - citrus trees heavy with fruit, waves of
bougainvillaea, a secret alley of camellias; but also hibiscus and cactus
and strange Antipodean shrubs, banana-trees and luxuriant palms, eerily
cylindrical trees with bark that feels like living hide. Where paths cross
there are fountains, and down a main artery trickles a slender watercourse,
Alhambra-style.
Amid the heady scents of this densely exotic mondello, one might expect
tropical birds too. Instead there are the distant cries of sopranos in
rehearsal - at least in <DATE>September</DATE>, when the <ORGANIZATION>Fondazione Walton</ORGANIZATION> funds an
intensive master-course for chosen young singers. Lady <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> is no less
intent on making La Mortella a nest for musical development than upon
cultivating her marvellous garden, onward and (especially) upward.
It burgeons from a long chasm in the lava-based ground, rife with
horticultural vitamins. In horizontal terms the acreage is not enormous, but
obliquely it stretches up and up. The <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> house is built into the cliff,
like the more recent <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> museum cum recital-room and the Tea-House;
thence paths ascend toward Sir <PERSON>William</PERSON>'s memorial rock, a serene 'Crocodile
Pool' and a topmost pond inhabited by a single, gigantically swollen lotus
plant.
For students and lucky guests there is also a swimming-pool with a matchless
view from a great height - echoing the crater-lake atop the extinct volcano
in the middle distance. The hard-working students need it, for their course
is strenuous. Last year it was devoted to Lieder, especially <PERSON>Hugo Wolf</PERSON>'s
Italian Songbook. This year the group was chosen through auditions in
<LOCATION>Florence</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> to make up a cast of six for <ORGANIZATION>Cimarosa's Il</ORGANIZATION> matrimonio
segreto.
They were outnumbered by their teachers, led by the producer <PERSON>Colin Graham</PERSON>
and <LOCATION>Glyndebourne</LOCATION>'s distinguished Head of Music Staff, <ORGANIZATION>Martin Isepp</ORGANIZATION>. While
they were coached rigorously in Italian diction as well as singing,
rehearsals for the <PERSON>Cimarosa</PERSON> proceeded. I watched <PERSON>Graham</PERSON> getting them to
extract the maximum dramatic sense from the recitatives, instead of gabbling
through them. It wasn't exactly a process of discovery, for he told them
repeatedly what their characters were feeling; but it was an object lesson
in faithful, practical attention to the text.
Earlier there was a concert in the gardens which let the young singers show
their paces. It included a performance of <ORGANIZATION>Walton</ORGANIZATION>'s Facade, brightly
conducted by <PERSON>Susanna Pescetti</PERSON>, and declaimed with the utmost verve and
clarity by Lady <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> herself with <PERSON>Graham</PERSON>.
The promising Rossini bass on the course, <PERSON>Antonio Abete</PERSON>, had to sing in a
<LOCATION>Parma</LOCATION> competition that night; but the singers' complement was made up by a
remarkable new contralto, <PERSON>Anna Maria</PERSON> di Micco. Her confident, impassioned
delivery of a Tancredi aria foretold a brilliant Rossinian future for her.
In <PERSON>Donizetti</PERSON> and two of <PERSON>Roger Steptoe</PERSON>'s 'Chinese Lyrics', the soprano <PERSON>Anna
Maria Panzarella</PERSON> sang with as much skill and charm as in the <ORGANIZATION>Royal College</ORGANIZATION>'s
Fille du Regiment this <DATE>summer</DATE>.
Also from the <ORGANIZATION>RCM</ORGANIZATION>, the mezzo <PERSON>Susan Legg</PERSON> was staunch and affecting in <LOCATION>Walton</LOCATION>
and <PERSON>Jonathan Harvey</PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION>Guildhall</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Simon Thorpe</PERSON>, whose English 'Count' in
the <PERSON>Cimarosa</PERSON> was developing nicely, shone in <ORGANIZATION>Vaughan Williams</ORGANIZATION> (less in
<LOCATION>Wagner</LOCATION>); <PERSON>Maurizio Dalena</PERSON>, from <LOCATION>Bari</LOCATION>, displayed a stylish tenor that wants
more variety of colour yet. Maria <PERSON>Angela Spotorno</PERSON> wields not only a
well-formed soprano, but the knowing allure of a much more experienced
performer; we shall see much more of her.
As <DATE>summer</DATE> schools go, the one at La Mortella is sui generis, not least
because of its extraordinary setting. The gardens are open to the public
several times a week (ring Ischia 081-986220). Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>La Mortella</ORGANIZATION>'s
Matrimonio segreto will have a British performance on <DATE>October 14</DATE>, in <LOCATION>Lady
Aberdeen</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Haddo Hall</PERSON>.

<HEAD>Texaco Claims Victory in Vote; Icahn Says Too Close To Call</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Texaco Inc.</ORGANIZATION> officials say they're confident
they have won their proxy war against <PERSON>Carl C. Icahn</PERSON>. But the wily
financier, who is also the oil giant's biggest shareholder, says he
thinks it could go either way.
   Top executives of the nation's third-largest oil company and
<PERSON>Icahn</PERSON>, who owns <PERCENT>14.8 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION>'s 243 million outstanding
shares, were speaking after the company's annual meeting here
<DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Icahn</PERSON>'s pursuit of five of <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION>'s 14 board seats has been
closely watched by shareholders and the investment community,
mainly because he has vowed to use those seats _ if he wins _ to
pressure the company to put his <MONEY>$60-a-share</MONEY>, <MONEY>$12.4 billion</MONEY> buyout
offer before the shareholders.
   The victor will not be known for weeks, however, because it will
take that long to sort through and tabulate the ballots.
   ``Our advisors tell us the likely outcome of the vote is that we
win,'' said <PERSON>James W. Kinnear</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION>'s president. Asked about the
margin of victory, he replied: ``We think it is substantial.''
   <PERSON>Icahn</PERSON> was a little more cautious, saying he thought the outcome
would hang on a block of shares controlled by the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>
investment firm <ORGANIZATION>Kohlberg, Kravis &amp; Roberts Co</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Kohlberg Kravis</ORGANIZATION> has not made public how much of its original 12
million-share stake it voted, or which way.
   ``If it went with us, we definitely win,'' <PERSON>Icahn</PERSON> said. ``If they
abstained, I believe we win. But if it went against us, we
definitely lose.''
   Wall Street appeared to be betting on management. It sent
<ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION>'s stock <MONEY>$1.50</MONEY> lower to close at <MONEY>$48</MONEY> a share <DATE>Friday</DATE> on the
<ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>.
   Final ballots were cast after <PERSON>Icahn</PERSON> and top <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION> officials
made their final pitches during the annual meeting, which was held
in a packed hotel ballroom.
   Speaking at his own lectern set off to the side, the takeover
specialist criticized <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION>'s management for refusing to let
shareholders vote on his offer for the <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION> shares he does not
already own.
   ``If we're elected, what we will do is keep our offer out
there,'' he said. ``Why should you not be allowed to decide? Simply
because management does not want to take the risk of losing its
position, its prerogatives.''
   At <MONEY>$60</MONEY> a share, <PERSON>Icahn</PERSON>'s bid puts a <MONEY>$14.6 billion</MONEY> value on the
company. Adding the <MONEY>$1.2 billion</MONEY> he paid for his stake to the <MONEY>$12.4
billion</MONEY> he is offering for the shares he does not own, the <MONEY>$13.6
billion</MONEY> total would amount to the largest buyout in corporate
history.
   The crowd, estimated at slightly more than 1,000, generally
favored management. <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION> has many employees in the <LOCATION>Tulsa</LOCATION> area, a
fact that did not go unnoticed by its mayor, <PERSON>Rodger A. Randle</PERSON>, who
rose to praise the company during a question-and-answer session.
   Many shareholders sported buttons featuring the familiar <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION>
star. Some went one better, dressing in various combinations of red
and white, the corporate colors.
   Another indication of the crowd's attitude came early in the
meeting, after <PERSON>Icahn</PERSON> protested when <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Alfred C.
DeCrane Jr.</PERSON> interrupted him to say he had exceeded his time limit
for speaking.
   ``A manifestation of the inflexibility that has caused <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION>
its problems,'' <PERSON>Icahn</PERSON> sniffed _ drawing mixed boos and cheers.
   Kinnear, speaking for the company's slate of directors, touted
the ``spectacular progress'' it had made over the <DATE>last 18 months</DATE>,
during which <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION> emerged in <DATE>April</DATE> from a year under Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection.
   The keystone of its reorganization plan was a <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY> payment
to <ORGANIZATION>Pennzoil Co.</ORGANIZATION> to settle a lawsuit resulting from <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>1984</DATE>
acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Getty Oil Co.</ORGANIZATION> after <ORGANIZATION>Pennzoil</ORGANIZATION> had made earlier moves
to acquire <LOCATION>Getty</LOCATION>.
   The plan includes sales of <MONEY>$5 billion</MONEY> of marginally profitable
assets and a <MONEY>$1.7 billion</MONEY> distribution to shareholders.
   ``Our plan ... is based on the building of value, both <DATE>today</DATE> and
for the future,'' <PERSON>Kinnear</PERSON> said, charging that the <PERSON>Icahn</PERSON> group's
true intention ``is that they be designated as the brokers for the
breakup and sale of this company's assets.''
   Several shareholders expressed skepticism about <PERSON>Icahn</PERSON>'s
intentions, even though the offer does propose about <MONEY>$10</MONEY> more per
share than <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION>'s stock has been trading for recently.
   ``If you turned (the company) over to <PERSON>Mr. Icahn</PERSON>, it would be
like giving your Stradivarius to a gorilla,'' said <PERSON>Bill Lenz</PERSON>,
referring to the prized antique violins made by the craftsman of
the same name.
   Several <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION> distributors and wholesalers also spoke, calling
for support of management while noting that <PERSON>Icahn</PERSON>'s actions had
harmed their businesses.
   ``Some of my dealers are looking for another supplier (and)
heating oil accounts are questioning whether I'll be able to supply
heating oil <DATE>this winter</DATE>, said <PERSON>Carlos R. Leffler</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>
distributor.
   But it was not all clear sailing for management.
   Reflecting a palpable current of shareholder unhappiness, <PERSON>Bill
Collallas</PERSON>, a shareholder from <LOCATION>Cherry Hill</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, criticized the
comany's ``shoddy and incompetent management'' over the past four
years.
   ``You're demeaning my intelligence by refusing my right to vote
on <PERSON>Mr. Icahn</PERSON>'s proposal. And I resent it,'' he told <PERSON>Kinnear</PERSON> and
<ORGANIZATION>DeCrane</ORGANIZATION>.

of sanding coming from the rear stops, and a man's voice calls out a
farewell.;    Kamimoto opened <ORGANIZATION>Kamimoto String Instruments</ORGANIZATION> 10 months ago at 609
<ORGANIZATION>N. Fourth St.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Japantown</LOCATION>. The self-taught violin and guitar repairman runs
the shop.;    <PERSON>Scott Shu-Kun Cao</PERSON>, <PERSON>Kamimoto</PERSON>'s partner of nearly six months,
specializes in making and repairing violins and other string instruments, such
as the cello and viola.;    "You could say I learned as an apprentice,"
<PERSON>Kamimoto</PERSON> said. "I had no formal background like <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> did. I worked part-time
for repair shops when I went to <LOCATION>Cal</LOCATION> (<ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>).;   
"I got interested in the guitar and how it was made after I was folk singing
for a while in college.;    "There are no standards to guitar repair, there
still aren't. In <DATE>1975</DATE>, I wrote a book ("Complete Guitar Repair"). Now, it's a
standard text.";    Kamimoto and Cao joined forces in <DATE>January</DATE>. "<PERSON>Scott</PERSON> was
working in a violin shop in <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> where I bought instruments. I met him
there. We got to talking," <PERSON>Kamimoto</PERSON> said.;    "We thought that by the two of
us getting together, we could strengthen our position in the field.;   
"Together, we improved our customer service by providing a wider range of
services, and we have expanded beyond <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> to a wider retail area," he
added.;    Aside from repairing string instruments, <PERSON>Kamimoto</PERSON> also imports
Chinese violins used by professional musicians.;    "These violins are of the
highest quality," he said. "They are hand-crafted and equal the value of those
from even <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>. They, of course, cost a lot less because of the current
working conditions in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>.";    Cao is originally from <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, and had two
years of formal training in violin-making there. After graduating, he went to
work at <LOCATION>Kapok</LOCATION>, a renowned violin factory in <LOCATION>China.</LOCATION>;    He moved to the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> <DATE>seven years ago</DATE>. In <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, Cao worked at <ORGANIZATION>Rolland Feller</ORGANIZATION>'s
violin shop, where he received his violin-repair training. He also worked for
<PERSON>Ifshin</PERSON>, a violin shop in <LOCATION>Berkeley.</LOCATION>;    "I was the major repairman there at
<LOCATION>Ifshin</LOCATION>, and in my spare time I kept making violins," <PERSON>Cao</PERSON> said. "In <DATE>1988</DATE>, I was
given the chance to attend a violin workshop, where I was taught by famous
violin makers like <PERSON>Hans Weisshaar</PERSON> and <PERSON>Luiz Bellini</PERSON>.";    Now with <PERSON>Kamimoto</PERSON>,
Cao specializes in restoring string instruments.;    The shop also sells
materials to students of the <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Instructional Method</ORGANIZATION>, which teaches
childrento play instruments at a very early age.;    "The theory of this
method is based on the fact that children learn through imitation, just like
they learn to speak long before they can read and write," <PERSON>Kamimoto</PERSON> said.;   
Similarly, Suzuki students listen to recorded music while learning to play.;  
 Kamimoto provides the instruments, tapes and books necessary to start young
children on the violin and cello.;    The instruments for the Suzuki method
are specially crafted for young children as they grow.;    A typical
3-year-old starting on the Suzuki method will go through six sizes of violins
before playing the standard-sized instrument.;    The smallest violin, 14 1/2
inches, looks toy-like compared with the standard-sized ones hanging on the
front wall. Kamimoto said it was not a toy, but was made to fit a 3-year-old's
arm.;    Kamimoto and Cao have customers from all over the globe. Their
regular Californian customers come from as far as the <LOCATION>East Bay</LOCATION> and even <LOCATION>Los
Angeles.</LOCATION>;    Both said they see strong support for the fine arts from the
Asian community.;    "There is a large group of Asians, mainly <LOCATION>Koreans</LOCATION>,
Chinese and Japanese, who choose to start their 3- or 4-year old children on
playing string instruments," <PERSON>Cao</PERSON> said. "These children grow up with the
violin, cello or viola, and they need good professional service to keep up
their instruments.;    "And when these students take that next step on
becoming professionals, they need a shop that provides quality instruments. We
provide these services to our customers."  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Severin Schurger spends weeks perfecting a violin,
days just carving and eyeing the scroll of his creation to ensure
its curves are even.
   ``Something I would like to achieve would be to make a nice
scroll quickly,'' says <PERSON>Schurger</PERSON>, who studied playing and making
violins in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, where his mentors could carve two perfectly
shaped spruce scrolls a day.
   So carefully does he work that he carves just two or three
violins a year out of spruce and maple, making about 25 violins,
six violas and three cellos in 18 years. The instruments sell for
about <MONEY>$6,000</MONEY> each.
   ``I just sort of stopped practicing and I wanted to devote my
life to repairing and making violins so other people can play. I
had a passion for it. It's something I really enjoy.''
   In addition to that passion, Schurger brought to the craft his
experience as a cabinetmaker on sailboats. ``There's a big
similarity between a sailboat and a violin,'' he says, likening a
violin's bridge to a sailboat's mast, its scroll to the sailboat's
decorative stem.
   Watching a violin take form is enjoyable, he says, but ``when I
put the varnish on, that's when it comes alive. That's a real big
turn-on.''
   For fun, <PERSON>Schurger</PERSON> spends his free time with voice lessons and
singing in a <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> opera company. But violins are his first love,
and he equates each of his finished instruments to a child that's
ready to leave home.
   ``I don't really get attached to one _ you can't. ... This thing
you are making is going out on the world stage. It's like a part of
yourself.''

      Maybe Stradivari
   Knew It All Along
   HAS THE SECRET of the <PERSON>Stradivari</PERSON> and Guarneri violins finally been found? 

   A <ORGANIZATION>Texas A&amp;M University</ORGANIZATION> scientist says it has. 
Moreover, he claims, it can be duplicated. 
The secret of the exquisite tone of these 17th century violins is in the varnish, not the wood or construction as had been assumed, says <PERSON>Joseph Nagyvary</PERSON>, professor of biophysics and biochemistry. 

   In research he's not yet published, Prof. <PERSON>Nagyvary</PERSON> says he's found the varnish "loaded with submicroscopic mineral crystals," of which he has so far identified 22 kinds, including antimony and ruby. 
Modern chemists would call it a composite polymer or resin. 
The crystals make the varnish extremely hard, "probably 100 times tougher" than varnish used on violins for the last 150 years, and explain the mystery of the old violins' unique sheen, he says. 

   More important, "we expect this varnish had a fundamental effect on tone," Prof. <PERSON>Nagyvary</PERSON> says. 
Until now, he says, experts "had considered the varnish a necessary evil," detracting from tone. 
But that's because it was assumed the varnish was the same gummy substance used in later centuries. 

   To make such a varnish "required enormous skill on the part of the chemists, who were probably the neighborhood druggists," he says. 
The ultrafine powders used would be quite toxic. 
As soon as all the mineral crystals are identified, it should be possible to duplicate the varnish and produce violins with the tone of instruments made by the <PERSON>Stradivari</PERSON> and Guarneri families, he believes. 

   As Temperatures Drop,
   Cholesterol Counts Rise
   CHOLESTEROL levels appear to rise in the winter and fall in the <DATE>summer</DATE> for no obvious reason. 

   Cholesterol levels in the blood were measured periodically for four years in more than 1,400 middle-aged men during a major research project to see if lowering cholesterol levels reduced the risk of heart attacks. 
The men, all of whom had high cholesterol levels, were in a control group and thus weren't treated for excess cholesterol. 
A new analysis finds that the average cholesterol level during December-January each year was 277.6 milligrams per deciliter of blood plasma, or 7.6 milligrams higher than in the June-July period. 

   Seasonal variations in weight also occurred, but this explained less than a third of the winter increase in cholesterol. 
It also was unlikely that differences in <DATE>summer</DATE> and winter diets could account for the difference in cholesterol levels, a team of federally sponsored researchers report in the journal Circulation. 
The winter increase in cholesterol isn't enough to cause any medical concern but "many fundamental questions about its origin and mechanism remain unanswered," say the mystified researchers. 

   Naturally Blue Roses,
   <ORGANIZATION>Carnations</ORGANIZATION> and Daisies
   FLOWERS of a different color may soon emerge from genetic-engineering laboratories. 

   Genetic engineers at the <ORGANIZATION>Max Planck Institute</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tubingen</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, report in the science journal Nature that they transplanted a gene from a corn plant into a petunia, changing the petunia's pigment-making chemistry. 
The process produced brick-red petunias instead of the usual pale pink ones. 

   The German experiment, done mainly as basic research, was good news to <ORGANIZATION>Calgene Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Davis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, genetic-engineering company. 
<ORGANIZATION>Calgene</ORGANIZATION> owns a third of an Australian horticulture firm that has cloned the gene that naturally produces blue petunias. 
Its scientists hope to transfer the gene to ornamental plants that don't ordinarily produce blue flowers, says <PERSON>Robert M. Goodman</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Calgene</ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president for research. 
The German success shows that such gene transfer can be done, he notes. 
Top on the list for the Australian researchers are truly blue roses, carnations, gerbera daisies and chrysanthemums. 

   Chemical Might Help
   Skin Grafts Survive
   SURGICAL PATIENTS and heart disease victims could be the beneficiaries of a novel chemical. 

   The chemical is difluoromethylornithine, or DFMO, developed a decade ago by <ORGANIZATION>Dow Chemical Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Merrell Dow</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary in <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION>. 
It slows down the division of cells and has been tested in cancer patients with mixed results. 
It currently is being tested in humans as a possible treatment for African sleeping sickness, which is caused by a rapidly multiplying, single-cell parasite. 

   To curb cell division, DFMO slows the metabolism of cells, reducing their oxygen needs. 
This feature caught the attention of plastic surgery researchers at <ORGANIZATION>Duke University Medical Center</ORGANIZATION>. 
In reconstructing damaged faces and other areas, surgeons often have to transplant large sections of tissue from one part of the body to another. 
If adequate blood circulation isn't restored quickly, some of the transplanted tissue will die for lack of oxygen. 

   The Duke scientists reasoned that if DFMO could reduce the tissue's oxygen needs, the grafts might survive longer, allowing for adequate blood circulation to be established. 
In experiments in rats, there was a <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> increase in the survival of skin grafts after DFMO treatment, the Duke researchers report in the <ORGANIZATION>Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology Journal</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The next step is to test DFMO in pigs, whose skin is more humanlike than that of rats, says <PERSON>Bruce Klitzman</PERSON>, director of plastic surgery research at <ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION>. 
The drug might also be tested in dogs to reduce the amount of heart muscle that dies when a heart attack blocks off the flow of oxygen-carrying blood.

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Alexander N. Pandis</PERSON> lived high _ plunking down
<MONEY>$32,000</MONEY> for a Rolls Royce, jetting to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> _ but federal
prosecutors say he made at least <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> from such scams as
selling rare musical instruments he had borrowed.
   Pandis, 25, of <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, pleaded guilty <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District
Court to mail fraud and credit-card fraud for a series of cons _
including bilking his father out of <MONEY>$53,000</MONEY> _ that began in <DATE>1983</DATE>,
said Assistant <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON>Patrick Foley</PERSON>.
   ``I'd describe him as obviously a very bright, intelligent
individual who chose to use his skills for illegal gain,'' <PERSON>Foley</PERSON>
said. ``It's actually a very unfortunate commentary on a kid who at
the age of 20 decided to perpetrate a fraud on various individuals
and made literally hundreds of thousands of dollars until he was
caught.''
   Pandis is to be sentenced <DATE>July 6</DATE> and could face up to 15 years
in prison and <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> in fines.
   The most lucrative of his scams involved borrowing rare, antique
musical instruments, such as a 138-year-old <PERSON>Pierre Pacherelle</PERSON>
violin made in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, from one dealer and selling them at bargain
prices to another, <PERSON>Foley</PERSON> said.
   ``There is a common practice in the industry to lend rare
instruments to people so they can try them out in their homes or
their studios,'' the prosecutor said.
   Pandis, posing as an investment counselor and lawyer, told the
dealers that his clients wanted to buy their rare violins, violas
and violin bows as investments, but asked to inspect them first.
   He never returned the instruments and made about <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> by
selling them to other, unsuspecting dealers, <PERSON>Foley</PERSON> said.
   Pandis was arrested <DATE>Jan. 27</DATE> on a federal complaint and indicted
<DATE>Feb. 26</DATE>.
   He used the illict profits for such things as a <MONEY>$32,000</MONEY> Rolls
<PERSON>Royce</PERSON> and taking trips to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Foley</PERSON> said.
   In <DATE>December 1985</DATE>, the indictment said, Pandis persuaded an
elderly woman to close her personal money market account and let
him manage about <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY> of her money, <PERSON>Foley</PERSON> said.
   Pandis spent most of the money on himself, the indictment
contends.
   He also is accused of stealing more than <MONEY>$40,000</MONEY> from his
father's individual retirement account and obtaining <MONEY>$13,000</MONEY> in
loans using his father's life insurance policy as collateral.
   In another scheme, <PERSON>Pandis</PERSON> set up his own investment counseling
firm in <DATE>1986</DATE> and sold <MONEY>$85,000</MONEY> worth of bogus, high-interest bonds
to 10 investors, <PERSON>Foley</PERSON> said.
   ``One thing led to another,'' <PERSON>Foley</PERSON> said. ``Once he ran out of
juice on one thing, he moved on to another. The final item was the
musical instruments, which was probably his greatest coup and
netted him about <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY>.''

   Occasionally, I go away from a sporting event wishing I had asked a question of one of the participants. 
I left <PERSON>Mike Tyson</PERSON>'s one-round knockout of <PERSON>Michael Spinks</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> with that feeling. 

   The question that occurred to me too late to raise would have been directed to <LOCATION>Tyson</LOCATION>. 
"Iron <PERSON>Mike</PERSON>," I should have said, "were you disappointed that the fight was so easy?" 

   I am sure that the query would have elicited hoots from some of my colleagues, and, I'd guess, a puzzled shrug from its target. 
If <PERSON>Tyson</PERSON> was in a mood to elucidate, which he isn't always, he might have explained to me that dispatching the party of the second part as expeditiously as possible was what boxing was all about, and, moreover, his duty as a professional. 

   He had, in fact, expressed his general philosophy on the matter at a press conference the <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> before the battle. 
"The Trumps, the Kennedys, the Rockefellers all come to the fights to see somebody get hurt," he said in answer to another question with a brutal logic that's useful for someone in a brutal business. 
"I intend to inflict pain as quickly as possible to get the fight over with fast." 

   The young man, however, is said to be a student of boxing history, and, given a chance for quiet reflection, conceivably could have responded in the affirmative. 
For the pity of his career so far -- if you can call his three-year dash through the heavyweight division a career -- is that he never has faced anyone who has even begun to test his skills and resources. 
An athlete needs a formidable opponent the way a violin virtuoso needs a Stradivarius. 
Without one, we -- and he -- will never know how good he really is. 

   That point has been addressed glancingly since the fray, mostly from the "we" perspective. 
Specifically, tears have been requested on behalf of those who paid anywhere from <MONEY>$1,500</MONEY> for a seat at ringside to <MONEY>$30</MONEY> for a seat at setside, but got to watch only 91 seconds of action. 
To have seen the ringsiders, however, was to wonder how many of them actually peeled off 1,500 of their own bucks for their tickets (would the glad-handing <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON> have accepted payment from the 500 or so dear friends he invited, including <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON>, <PERSON>George Steinbrenner</PERSON> -- boo!!! -- and <PERSON>Carl Icahn</PERSON>?). 
The rest can write off the expense to consumer education. 

   The "we" part that deserves greater note is the way we evaluate our sports heroes, both contemporarily and in retrospect. 
Rarely is an athlete's performance considered in isolation; rather, he is rated in comparison with the more memorable of his peers. 

   Thus, when we think of <ORGANIZATION>Muhammad Ali</ORGANIZATION>, we think mostly of his epic struggles with <PERSON>Joe Frazier</PERSON>, and when we recall <PERSON>Joe Louis</PERSON> it is in connection with his two goes with <PERSON>Max Schmeling</PERSON>. 
Same with Dempsey-Tunney, Marciano-Charles, and Leonard-Hagler. 

   Conversely, triumphs over inferior opposition ruin the pleasure of spectator and participant alike. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Olympians will tell you that the Soviet bloc boycott of the <DATE>1984</DATE> Games at <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> devalued their medal haul. 
Soviet and East German medalists at the U.S.-boycotted <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> <DATE>Games four years earlier</DATE> regard their own prizes similarly. 

   I thought the most interesting comment during the recent <ORGANIZATION>National Basketball Association</ORGANIZATION> playoffs came from a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Lakers</ORGANIZATION> (Magic Johnson, I think), who bemoaned the semifinal elimination of the <ORGANIZATION>Boston Celtics</ORGANIZATION>, his team's ertswhile nemesis and longtime sparring partner. 
He said the Celtics at playoff time always bring out things in the Lakers that the <ORGANIZATION>Lakers</ORGANIZATION> didn't know they had in themselves. 

   Tyson is unbeaten in his 35 professional fights, but that isn't what makes him unique; <PERSON>Rocky Marciano</PERSON> and <PERSON>Larry Holmes</PERSON> were undefeated heavyweight champions before him. 
Tyson stands out because he also is unscored upon, which is to say that his superiority never has been in doubt in any of his matches. 
Four of his fights have gone to decisions, the most recent coming last year against <PERSON>James</PERSON> "Bonecrusher" <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> and <PERSON>Tony Tucker</PERSON>. 
Both those worthies were large, strong men who survived by abandoning any hope of victory early on and clutching <PERSON>Tyson</PERSON>'s arms at every opportunity. 

   It is, moreover, questionable whether <PERSON>Smith</PERSON>, <PERSON>Tucker</PERSON> or anyone else could today force Tyson to hear a last-round bell. 
"<PERSON>Mike</PERSON>'s improved <PERCENT>50-60%</PERCENT> since the <PERSON>Tucker</PERSON> fight. 
People forget he's only 21 years old," trainer <PERSON>Kevin Rooney</PERSON> asserted before the <PERSON>Spinks</PERSON> go. 
"No way anybody could hold him off like that anymore." 
And, indeed, <PERSON>Tyson</PERSON>'s last four outings have ended in swift KOs. 

   Tyson's domination of his division could stem from the paucity of his opposition or his own, overwhelming gifts. 
I suspect it is the latter. 
The "Rocky" movies to the contrary notwithstanding, boxing at its highest level can be a subtle contest of styles and tactics, with two skilled professionals able to go many rounds before a solid blow is landed. 
That's why <PERSON>A.J. Liebling</PERSON> could write about the "sweet science," and the "cunning pressures" of arms and body with which the master <PERSON>Archie Moore</PERSON> manipulated foes. 

   I confess I thought <PERSON>Spinks</PERSON> had much of the "Moore" about him. 
But there is little subtlety to a Tyson fight. 
The opening bell sounds and he is there, in his opponent's face, pummeling him with punches of great force and unprecedented speed. 
"They all come in with plans, but they forget 'em quick," <PERSON>Tyson</PERSON> notes. 
Pretty soon, they forget everything else. 

   If there is anyone around who might test <PERSON>Tyson</PERSON>, he has yet to show himself. 
Boxing is not a sport that many play joyfully, so challenging challengers may remain scarce for quite some time. 

   There will be no lack of opponents because people will do a lot of things if the price is right, including accepting a beating. 
It's altogether possible that one day <PERSON>Tyson</PERSON> will become careless and lose to a lesser man, or, simply, get bored and quit. 
That would be sad for us, and doubly so for him.

<HEAD>The Artists: The Endangered Euphonium and Other Instruments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE LLOYD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Know anyone who plays the euphonium?
   When was the last time you picked up your bassoon and blew a
bouncy tune?
   The euphonium, a brass-wind instrument with a mellow tone, and
the bassoon, a woodwind instrument with a long, curved stem, are
among some less popular instruments some musicologists fear may
become as endangered as the whooping crane.
   In an effort to reverse this trend, the <ORGANIZATION>Settlement Music School</ORGANIZATION>
is encouraging its students to play lesser-known instruments.
   <PERSON>Robert Capanna</PERSON>, the executive director of the school, said the
number of students playing such endangered instruments as the
euphonium, bassoon, cello, double bass, harp, oboe, trombone, tuba,
viola, French horn and organ is declining.
   He is concerned about the trend and said he wonders what the
professional implications could be if it is not changed. <PERSON>Capanna</PERSON>
noted there is intense competition for positions in orchestras.
However, if more interest in some instruments is not developed,
that competition could wane.
   <PERSON>Ronald Demkee</PERSON>, associate conductor of the <LOCATION>Allentown</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>,
symphony and the orchestra director at <ORGANIZATION>Freedom High School</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Bethlehem</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, said the quality of the performers is still high,
but there could be concern if fewer people study some instruments.
   ``The people that are auditioning seem to be more prepared than
ever,'' he said. However, the number of bassoon players at the high
school, for example, has dropped from five to one <DATE>over the last
several years</DATE>.
   Schools across the country are reporting the same trend as the
<ORGANIZATION>Settlement School</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Capanna</PERSON> said. He attributed the swing in
interest to cuts in school music programs.
   ``Kids at an early age are not getting that exposure (of
different instruments),'' he explained.
   Settlement offers a class called ``Meet the Instruments of the
Orchestra,'' and provides scholarships for students to play such
``endangered instruments'' as the euphonium, a tenor tuba.
   ``Kids who are interested in music have a narrow frame of
interest,'' <PERSON>Capanna</PERSON> said, adding that piano and violin are, by far,
the most popular instruments being studied. ``We want to make kids
aware that there are other instruments.''
   Piano students are now encouraged to also take up the organ, and
violinists are also steered toward learning how to play the viola.
   Settlement sponsored a program in which it distributed 120,000
comic books and tapes to schoolchildren called ``Quadrus and
Friends Musical Journey.'' The books and tapes attempted to make
children aware of how music touches their lives, and how they can
become involved in music if they have the desire.
   ``The idea was to get kids to recognize ... there were people
involved in good music,'' <PERSON>Capanna</PERSON> said.
   The school of 6,000 students, aged 3 to adult, is the largest
community arts school in the nation. It was founded 80 years ago.
   The executive director said the enrollment has changed over the
last decade. Ten years ago, <PERSON>Capanna</PERSON> said, <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> of the
students played wind and brass instruments, the typical ``band
instruments,'' such as clarinet, flute, trumpet and the endangered
instruments.
   Now, he said, <PERCENT>13 percent</PERCENT> of the enrollment are studying those
instruments. He estimated that another <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> of the students
are playing the piano, and the remainder are studying voice or
playing string instruments, mainly the violin.
   ``In the long run, it will level out,'' <PERSON>Demkee</PERSON> said, noting that
some students will change over to the more needed instruments.
   A lack of interest in some instruments can affect other music
students, <PERSON>Capanna</PERSON> said.
   Because so many people are playing the piano and violin, their
musical experience won't be as rich. There are limits to what the
two instruments can play together and playing with a group of
people enrichs a student's experience, he said.
   When the student is part of an audience for a musical
performance, his or her appreciation will be greater if his or her
musical experience is deeper, <PERSON>Capanna</PERSON> said.
   The popularity of the Suzuki method of teaching the violin also
has shifted interest to the instrument, he said. The Suzuki method
was developed by a doctor in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> about 20 years ago and is a way
of teaching youngsters how to play the violin before they're even
able to read music. Therefore, the child is already playing the
violin before he knows the other options available.
   The method has since been applied to other instruments.

<HEAD>Jazzman's Irreplaceable Contrabass Stolen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 150-year-old German-made contrabass
was stolen from Danish jazzman <PERSON>Niels Henning Oersted Pedersen</PERSON> in
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, a newspaper reported <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   ``I've been playing on it since <DATE>1963</DATE>. It's like losing an arm,''
<PERSON>Oersted Pedersen</PERSON>, also known as ``NHOP'' among jazz fans, told the
<LOCATION>Copenhagen</LOCATION> daily, <LOCATION>Politiken</LOCATION>.
   Oersted <PERSON>Pedersen</PERSON> said he might have to cancel concerts across
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> unless the instrument is recovered.
   ``I sound like that contrabass. And that sound can hardly be
recreated on another instrument,'' he said. The contrabass, the
largest instrument in the violin family, has a range an octave
below a normal bass.
   The contrabass disappeared last <DATE>Friday</DATE> at the Frankfurt-am-Main
international airport in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> where <PERSON>Oersted Pedersen</PERSON> was
attending a jazz festival with Belgian guitar player <PERSON>Philippe
Catherine</PERSON>. The two were also to make a record in a German studio.
   Oersted <PERSON>Pedersen</PERSON>, 44, owns another contrabass, a French-built
instrument from the <DATE>17th century</DATE>. ``But I don't dare travel with
it. It's too fragile,'' he said.

<HL> Chain-Saw Massacre: Finger Lakes Slashes Its Way to Victory --- College Woodsmen Despoil Trees in Name of Sport; Eat Wood, Lumberhead! </HL>
<AUTHOR> David Stipp (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<DATELINE> WATERVILLE, Maine  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Okay, sports-trivia buffs, show your stuff: In the twitch-peavey-deck, does the scoot load come first or last? 

   Hint: We're talking about a sport in which frying pans are standard equipment, <ORGANIZATION>Community College</ORGANIZATION> of the Finger Lakes in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> state is top-seeded, and boiling water is a competitive event. 

   Stumped? 
You're getting warmer. 

   The twitch-peavey-deck is part of the Woodsmen's <DATE>Weekend</DATE>, an annual intercollegiate contest in which enthusiastic young people do violence to trees. 

   The 42nd such contest, held here at <ORGANIZATION>Colby College</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>last weekend</DATE>, attracted some 40 men's and women's six-member teams from schools in the <LOCATION>Northeast U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. 
They spent two days chopping, sawing and otherwise trying to clear-cut the competition at traditional lumberjack skills. 
It was the Rose Bowl of the woodsmen's world, but you probably didn't hear about it. 

   Although the sport has all the ebullient bloodletting of rugby, it remains well out on the periphery of American athletics. 
Even at forestry schools there's limited interest in lugging logs across muddy fields in driving sleet, as one event calls for, to say nothing of standing around watching others do it. 
And the sport's heroes, though hard as a sack of hammers, don't have much TV appeal: "They say it's a sport for old, fat men," says <PERSON>Don Quigley</PERSON>, a husky 39-year-old who teaches forestry at the <ORGANIZATION>University of New Hampshire</ORGANIZATION> and competes on the pro circuit. 

   Still, it is the rodeo of the plaid-shirt-and-gum-boots crowd, including the ones from <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>. 
When the gleaming "racing" axes and lovingly tended <MONEY>$1,500</MONEY> competition saws are brought out, the adrenalin rises like sap in <DATE>April</DATE>. 

   "Eat wood!" screams <ORGANIZATION>Colby</ORGANIZATION> captain <PERSON>Jeff Glover</PERSON>, as his teammates rip through a timber with a two-handled saw in an event called "crosscut from hell." 
Describing another event, in which competitors stand on elevated logs while chopping them in two, <LOCATION>Colby</LOCATION> woodsmen's coach <PERSON>Debbie Smith</PERSON> says, "People love to see people chopping at their feet." 

   It is considered bad form to fell trees on opposing teams, but just about anything else in lumberjack lore is fair game at collegiate woodsmen's meets. 
Competitive tobacco spitting is a disgusting old favorite, and many contestants here constantly warmed up for it even though, this time, it wasn't on the program. 
Lately, lighting matches with ax blows is in fashion. 

   The host team for a meet can customize the events or even spring new ones on opponents. 
Two years ago, a Canadian host team stunned rivals with a new event for which it had practiced for months. 
The idea: to knock an opponent off logs spinning on ball bearings. 
Another host school introduced fly-casting at inner-tube targets, but strong winds blew away its advantage. 

   At the <ORGANIZATION>Colby</ORGANIZATION> meet, participants race canoes, throw axes, lob logs, fell trees, clamber up poles and scramble through the woods with packs containing 50-pound weights and a skillet. 
The water-boil race involves building a fire and boiling water, using only three matches, one log and various sharp tools. 
In the twitch-peavey-deck, two people twitch, or drag, a 400-pound log with ropes. 
Then, using peaveys -- harpoonlike tools -- they roll it through an obstacle course. 
And finally, they scoot the whole load up a ramp, called a deck. 

   All this is considered great fun by these amateur woodsmen, who relish the camaraderie that develops among people sharing pain. 
Their meets have little to do with modern logging, in which people in air-conditioned cabs often dismantle trees with huge machines. 
But the sport includes oddball concessions to modern realities, like the chain-saw log-cutting competition, which takes about as much skill as pumping iron with forklifts. 

   At college meets, an injury, if only mildly maiming, is no reason to quit. 
Only the greenest rookies have no scars on hands and arms. 
<PERSON>Marty Dodge</PERSON>, the coach of the Finger Lakes team, tells how his chain saw once "jumped up" from a log during a contest and laid open his scalp. 
At this year's meet, <PERSON>Ann Thayer</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Colby</ORGANIZATION> graduate on the school's alumni team, was just about to complete the twitch-peavey-deck when a teammate drove a peavey point into her hand, breaking a bone and sending her to the hospital. (She was back the next day as a judge.) 

   <PERSON>Ms. Thayer</PERSON> recalls a worse incident, the day the chips hit the fan. 
An ax head flew off, wounding the one good leg of a bystander who was already on crutches. 

   Most of the damage at the meets is to pride, though. 
<PERSON>Pam Parker</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Colby</ORGANIZATION> contestant, bursts into tears during the portage event when the wind flips her canoe into a nearby pond and blows it out of reach. 
In a two-man canoe race, <ORGANIZATION>University of Vermont</ORGANIZATION> woodsmen <PERSON>Albert Knudsen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bill Cleary</PERSON> launch their canoe on the run and promptly flip over. 
"People who do this make total fools of themselves," says <PERSON>Sally Keefer</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>University of Vermont</ORGANIZATION> woodswoman. 
"But nobody cares." 

   Woodsmen's meets have camp appeal at schools such as <LOCATION>Dartmouth</LOCATION>, whose men's team showed up one year in tuxedos for a sawing contest. 
But at <ORGANIZATION>Sir Sandford Fleming College of Lindsay</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION>, where woodsmen's athletics is one of two varsity sports (the other is hockey), students get "woodsmen's fever," a kind of obsessive chopping condition, says <PERSON>Bill Deba</PERSON>, the coach. 
And Finger Lakes college has so many trophies they can't all fit in the display case. 
It worsened its problem this year by winning both the men's and women's grand prizes, edging Sir <PERSON>Sandford Fleming</PERSON> in both cases. 

   Preparing for meets, tool specialists on such teams may spend 30 hours sharpening a single competition saw; the saws are handed down from team to team like Stradivarius violins. 
Some squads train year-round. 
<PERSON>Chuck Congdon</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Finger Lakes</ORGANIZATION> keeps in shape in the off season by chopping wood for relatives. 
<PERSON>Chris McGee</PERSON>, a passionate young woodsman from <ORGANIZATION>Pinkerton Academy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Derry</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.H.</LOCATION>, is pulling out all the stops for this year's meet; he isn't going to any parties on nights before his events. 

   The ultimate reward for all this work is a chance to win <MONEY>hundreds of dollars</MONEY> at pro woodsmen's meets. 
<PERSON>Mr. Quigley</PERSON>, the part-time pro who competed here on an alumni team, and a teammate showed how good the pros are by sawing through an 8-by-8 pine timber nine times in 39 seconds. 

   But for many, turning pro will remain only a dream. 
Pondering the future with a faraway look in his eyes, Finger Lakes' <PERSON>Mr. Congdon</PERSON> says, "I don't know if I'm good enough for the pros."
