Three Sachems: Clay, Webster, Calhoun

<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   Three decades ago, <PERSON>John Kennedy</PERSON>, obsessed with greatness in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> but unwilling to achieve it himself, headed a committee to select which senators to honor with portraits in the ornate Senate Reception Room. 
Scholars and commentators were consulted and the verdict was fairly predictable. 
The top three finishers were <PERSON>Henry Clay</PERSON>, <PERSON>Daniel Webster</PERSON> and <PERSON>John C. Calhoun</PERSON>. 

   Clay, <PERSON>Webster</PERSON> and <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> -- their names flow off the tongue in a group. 

   The leading political figures of the "second generation" of American leaders, they were, as <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> historian <PERSON>Merrill Peterson</PERSON> puts it, "part of the furniture of American memory." 

   "The Great Triumvirate" (<ORGANIZATION>Oxford</ORGANIZATION>, 576 pages, <MONEY>$27.95</MONEY>) is an unusual alchemy -- one part history, one part biography -- by a leading American historian who argues that these three men -- one from the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION>, one from the South, one from the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> -- were the match of the founding generation of Americans: "When the last of this 'second race of giants' passed away in <DATE>1852</DATE>, nothing was left to challenge the sway of the Lilliputians," he writes. 
"The republic lost its glory -- the regalia of great statesmen." 

   <PERSON>Henry Clay</PERSON>, the man <PERSON>John Quincy Adams</PERSON> called "a republican of the first fire," elevated the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> to new importance. 
He fashioned his own ideology, an "American System" that consisted of policies to encourage national economic development, chiefly protective tariffs and a series of internal improvements that now would be known as public-works projects. 
And though he thought slavery would wither away -- he later advocated repatriating slaves back to <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> as colonists -- he became known for his ability to sculpt compromise after compromise on the slavery question. 
Clay, according to <PERSON>Mr. Peterson</PERSON>, had a "genius for accommodation, sensitivity to opposing political forces and ingenuity in adapting old policies to new conditions." 

   Webster is known in history much the same way he was known as a young <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> lawyer with a gift for oratory -- the "guardian of the Constitution." 
<PERSON>Mr. Peterson</PERSON> credits him with pioneering the "theory of the Constitution as the fundamental law of one people, rather than a compact of sovereign states." 

   And <PERSON>John C. Calhoun</PERSON>. 
First pressed by the early Nullifiers, then their champion, he embraced this tool of expedience to assure his base in <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>, to protect his region from the threat of high tariffs and to muffle the drumbeats of Abolition. 
"It took possession of him, transfixed his political vision, and justified all his actions," says <PERSON>Mr. Peterson</PERSON>. 

   He once viewed slavery as scaffolding for the South, support that would be removed "when the building is finished." 
Later he came to call it "a great good." 
He was, moreover, a proponent of small government in the <LOCATION>Jefferson</LOCATION> model, aiming for nothing less, as he put it, "than to turn back the <ORGANIZATION>Government</ORGANIZATION> to where it commences operations in <DATE>1789</DATE>." 
<PERSON>Mr. Peterson</PERSON> sees <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON>'s power resting "not on charisma or organization but on a political ideology that postulated unity in the state and eventually in the section as the only means of securing slavery and the South from an encroaching northern majority." 

   The three united in <DATE>1832</DATE> to oppose <PERSON>Andrew Jackson</PERSON> but, <PERSON>Mr. Peterson</PERSON> points out, spent most of their public lives dancing a political version of the country reel, changing partners and calculating their every move with an eye on what the others would do. 
Webster first opposed Clay on tariff protection, then switched sides and found himself opposing <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON>, as vice president under <PERSON>John Quincy Adams</PERSON>, stacked the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Foreign Relations Committee</ORGANIZATION> against <ORGANIZATION>Secretary of State Clay</ORGANIZATION>. 
And although Clay and <PERSON>Webster</PERSON>, the two leading Whigs, united in opposing an independent <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> scheme proffered by the <PERSON>Van Buren</PERSON> administration, they fought so much they paved the way for <PERSON>William Henry Harrison</PERSON> to snatch the presidency in <DATE>1840</DATE>. 

   Each had great achievements. 
From his position in the border state of <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, Clay formed two great compromises. 
Although he never shed the charges of "bargain and corruption" growing out of his maneuvers that left <PERSON>John Quincy Adams</PERSON> as president in <DATE>1824</DATE>, he was an active and successful secretary of state. 
Webster is now regarded as among the greatest secretaries of state in history, having prevented war with the British and helped fix the nation's northern border. 
And <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> today is regarded as one of the few original thinkers of the era that followed the Founding Fathers'. 

   Despite the triumvirs' documented greatness, <PERSON>Mr. Peterson</PERSON> offers harsh assessments of their legacies. 
The Civil War that followed their deaths would have offered Clay "grim proofs of the limits of compromise." 
It would have demonstrated to <PERSON>Webster</PERSON> "the fragility of law and constitutions before moral and social forces he never truly understood." 
And it offered an "awful judgment" on <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON>. 
His face ended up on the currency and postage stamps not of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, but of the Confederacy.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Is Capitol Salesmanship `What This Country
Needs?'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans wanting to sell anything from
biscuits and cigars to plumbing and whiskey often have tried to
cloak their wares in the presumed respectability of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and
its most illustrious members.
   <PERSON>Daniel Webster</PERSON>, for example.
   Webster, perhaps the most famous senator and orator of the
mid-19th century, had his face and his name used to promote cigars,
flour, and a concoction known as <ORGANIZATION>Dr. J.C. Ayres Cherry Pectoral</ORGANIZATION>,
promoted as a cure for coughs, colds, bronchitis, croup, whooping
cough and other ailments.
   According to a new three-case exhibit recently installed in a
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> corridor, the claim that <PERSON>Webster</PERSON> endorsed <PERSON>Dr. Ayres</PERSON>' elixer
may have been somewhat exaggerated.
   Promoters of the product claimed that <PERSON>Webster</PERSON> praised it in <DATE>1853</DATE>.
   The famed statesman died in <DATE>1852</DATE>.
   The exhibit, organized by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Senate Commission</ORGANIZATION> on Art and
Antiquities, includes a shiny metal spatula from <DATE>1910</DATE> which
demonstrates that even 58 years after <PERSON>Webster</PERSON>'s death his name
still had commercial appeal.
   Webster's features are engraved on the widest spot of the
antique pancake turner, which is also emblazoned with the words:
``<PERSON>Daniel Webster</PERSON> Flour, Better Than the Best'' and ``One Good Turn
Deserves Another.''
   <PERSON>Webster</PERSON>'s face was also used on the flour bag with the words:
``<PERSON>Daniel Webster</PERSON> Flour Bakes Everything Better.''
   In an age when a cigar brought to mind a politician, <PERSON>Webster</PERSON>
also was used to promote a brand of cigars.
   Their name?
   ``Websters,'' of course.
   The names and faces of <PERSON>Webster</PERSON>'s contemporaries, Sens. <PERSON>John C.
Calhoun</PERSON> of <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Henry Clay</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> also were used
to peddle cigars.
   And for years, Old Crow whiskey identified itself as, ``The
Whiskey That <PERSON>Henry Clay</PERSON> Took to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.''
   ``From the earliest days of advertising, senators have been
known to endorse commercial products,'' notes a news release issued
by the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> commission.
   From the beginning of the advertising age in the mid-19th
century, ``our country's enterprises have understood the power of
national legislative symbols to influence the American consumer,''
the commission said.
   The display has a title _ ``What This Country Needs'' _ taken
from the <DATE>1917</DATE> declaration of Vice President <PERSON>Thomas Marshall</PERSON> that
``What this country needs is a good five cent cigar.''
   Although <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> did not recommend any particular brand of
nickel cigar, the exhibit makes clear that he would not have been
breaking new ground had he done so.
   A much later advertisement for Lucky Strike cigarettes reads:
``<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON>Gerald P. Nye</PERSON> Says: `I enjoy the comfort a light smoke
gives my throat.''
   The familiar image of the Capitol dome has been used, according
to the exhibit, to symbolize ``purity, wholesomeness,
respectability and success, innovation and leadership, prosperity
and celebration.''
   In one <DATE>1890</DATE>'s advertisement, the Capitol looms in the background
as two bearded senators are served Schlitz beer at a table
surrounded by ferns.
   ``The Capitol at <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> is painted with oxide of zinc,''
proclaims another advertisement, implying that American homeowners
would do well to use that ingredient on their own domicile.
   On display are advertisements for breakfast cereals, stationery,
soft drinks, biscuits, tires, soap, cameras, and plumbing, all
using the Capitol theme.
   One proclaims that the <LOCATION>Durham</LOCATION> Plumbing System has been installed
in ``the greatest building on this continent _ the Capitol at
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.''
   In another, fashionably dressed men, presumably senators, are
shown striding up the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>'s marble steps.
   All of this has caused an occasional raised eyebrows, and the
Arts and <ORGANIZATION>Antiquities Commission</ORGANIZATION> notes that the use of the Capitol
in commercial advertising never has been sanctioned by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
   But neither has the practice been banned.
   In <DATE>1956</DATE> the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> reported out a bill
banning the use of ``pictures of the Capitol or other public
buildings in ... advertising when it would be reasonably calculated
to convey the false impression that the company has some connection
with, or was insured by, the <ORGANIZATION>United States Government</ORGANIZATION>.''
   The measure passed the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.
   But the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> failed to act on it.

<HEAD>Senate Celebrates Its First Two Centuries</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, told it ``is a guardian of
tradition without becoming a barrier to change,'' celebrated its
first two centuries of history on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, recalling its faltering
beginnings and noting its many milestones.
   <DATE>April 6, 1789</DATE>, was the date that the first <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, meeting in
<LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>, finally reached a quorum _ and thus was able to
start conducting business _ after a frustrating month of failing to
do so.
   ``History oozes from these walls,'' said <PERSON>Sen. John Glenn</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>D-Ohio</LOCATION>, as the day of commemoration began in the Old Senate Chamber
in the Capitol with the issuing of a postage stamp displaying the
gilt shield and eagle still suspended over the presiding officer's
chair.
   The eagle and shield were there during speeches on the old
chamber's floor which served the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> from <DATE>1810</DATE> to <DATE>1859</DATE>, and can
be seen in <DATE>19th century</DATE> prints involving three famous senators of
the era: <PERSON>Daniel Webster</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Henry Clay</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>
and <PERSON>John C. Calhoun</PERSON> of <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>.
   Those three senators and the roles they played in the period
before the Civil War were invoked repeatedly as past and former
senators hailed the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> as an institution.
   <PERSON>Howard H. Baker Jr.</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>, a former <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Republican
leader, said the sense of history in the old <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> hall, and in
the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>'s present chamber first occupied in <DATE>1859</DATE>, is so strong
that at times one can truly ``smell the marble.''
   Nearly 20 former senators _ including <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> and former
Democratic leader <PERSON>Mike Mansfield</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> _ joined senators in
the current 101st <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> for the ceremonies. Members of the <ORGANIZATION>House
of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> celebrated the quorum bicentennial session of
that body on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   Former <PERSON>Sen. Thomas F. Eagleton</PERSON>, a Democrat from <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, said
that the legacy of the early <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> is the art of the American
political compromise.
   ``Today compromise is woven into constitutional fabric of the
nation,'' <PERSON>Eagleton</PERSON> said.
   Although many senators past and present have regarded compromise
as morally wrong, <PERSON>Eagleton</PERSON> said it is politically essential.
   ``Compromise, in my judgment, is getting a bad rap,'' <PERSON>Eagleton</PERSON>
said. ``Without it we screech to a halt, paralyzed by
intransigence.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> session began at <TIME>11 a.m.</TIME>, the hour of the first
session two centuries ago.
   With the conclusion of the ceremony's first half in the old
chamber, senators formed a procession to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>'s present
meeting place down the hall.
   Senior senators from the states answered the roll call,
beginning with <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION>, which became the first state in <DATE>1787</DATE>, and
continuing to <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, which in <DATE>1959</DATE> became the 50th to join the
union.
   When <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>'s name was called, Republican <PERSON>Strom Thurmond</PERSON>
gave this response: ``<LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> was not the first state to be
admitted, but it was the first to secede'' in <DATE>1860</DATE>. After the Civil
War, <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> returned to the union in <DATE>1868</DATE>.
   Sen. <PERSON>Ted Stevens</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Alaska</LOCATION>, noted <PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON>'s description
of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> as a stage, and recalled some of the drama the
present chamber has witnessed, including the one-vote defeat of the
attempt to oust President <PERSON>Andrew Johnson</PERSON> during Reconstruction
after the Civil War, and the rejection of President <PERSON>Woodrow
Wilson</PERSON>'s effort to bring the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> into the <ORGANIZATION>League of
Nations</ORGANIZATION> after World War I.
   <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON>George Mitchell</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Maine</LOCATION>, said that while
the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> has undergone many changes over the years, it remains a
place where the rights of the minority are protected and speech can
remain virtually unlimited.
   ``It is a guardian of tradition without becoming a barrier to
change,'' he said.
   Senators moved in and out of the ceremonies to spirited <PERSON>John
Philip Sousa</PERSON> marches played by the <ORGANIZATION>Marine Corps</ORGANIZATION> band.
   A tourist asked a doorman: ``Does a band play every day the
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> meets?''
   ``No,'' the doorman replied. ``Only once every 200 years.''

Assessing Early American Tariffs</HL>
<DD> 08/18/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   It was amusing to read <PERSON>James Bovard</PERSON>'s "American History: Pass a Tariff, Start a War" (editorial page, <DATE>July 20</DATE>) in defense of free trade, because the truth about American history is that for the greater part of it, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> was a strongly protectionist nation. 
From <DATE>1789</DATE> until the end of World War II, our country rose to become the greatest economic power on earth behind high tariff walls. 
The Japanese and <LOCATION>Koreans</LOCATION> seem to have learned more from American history than we have. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Bovard</PERSON> cites anachronisms such as <PERSON>John Taylor</PERSON> and nonentities such as <PERSON>Frank H. Hurd</PERSON>. 
But those of us who believe a little trade regulation might be a very good thing indeed can take comfort in such historical allies as <PERSON>Alexander Hamilton</PERSON>, <PERSON>Henry Clay</PERSON>, <PERSON>Daniel Webster</PERSON> and <PERSON>John C. Calhoun</PERSON> before he became the sectional spokesman for the free-trading but slave-holding plantation owners of the south. 

   What is more, since <PERSON>George</PERSON> <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON> and <PERSON>Theodore Roosevelt</PERSON> all supported tariffs or other protectionist measures during their presidencies, we might even want to conclude that the world's greatest monument to fair trade was carved in the rock of <LOCATION>Mount Rushmore</LOCATION>.

   <PERSON>Mr. Bovard</PERSON> makes the bold claim that "Few people realize that restrictive trade policies were a major cause of the American Revolution." 
He cites <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s prohibiting Americans from "erecting any mill for rolling or slitting iron." 

   Americans during that time did not seem disturbed by this prohibition. 
<PERSON>John Adams</PERSON> wrote that, "<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> has all along consented, still consent and ever will consent, that Parliament . . . should regulate the trade of the dominions." 
And the <ORGANIZATION>First Continental Congress</ORGANIZATION>, in a resolution, declared that "we cheerfully consent to the operation of such Acts of the British Parliament, as are bona fide restrained to the regulation of our external commerce, for the purpose of securing the commercial advantages of the whole empire to the mother country, and the commercial benefits of its respective members." 

   Pre-Revolutionary Americans perhaps can be excused for thinking that trade restrictions benefit the nation. 
After all, <PERSON>Adam Smith</PERSON>'s "Wealth of Nations" had not yet been published. 
Modern Americans cannot likewise be excused.

<HEAD>Lawmen Celebrate 200 Years In Action</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From the days President <PERSON>George Washington</PERSON>
dispatched the first <LOCATION>United States Marshals</LOCATION> to quell the <ORGANIZATION>Whiskey
Rebellion</ORGANIZATION>, the storied lawmen have been part of the country's most
colorful and most violent episodes.
   They did the hanging for famous ``Hanging Judge'' <PERSON>Isaac Parker</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Fort Smith</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ark.</LOCATION>, after rounding up bank and train robbers hiding in
the brush of Indian Territory, smashed whiskey stills during
Prohibition and protected slaves freed after the Civil War.
   The nation's oldest law enforcement organization, the Marshals
began their bicentennial celebration <DATE>Thursday</DATE> with the opening of an
exhibit at the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> followed by a black-tie dinner at a
nearby hotel.
   Organized by the <ORGANIZATION>Marshals Service</ORGANIZATION> with the help of the
<ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian Insitution</ORGANIZATION>, the exhibit displays artifacts from
massacres and shootouts that have earned the men their place in the
lore of the <LOCATION>Wild West</LOCATION> and their immortalization by movie legends
<PERSON>John Wayne</PERSON> and <PERSON>Henry Fonda</PERSON>.
   ``As the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> expanded across the continent, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
Marshals and their deputies established the federal goverment's
authority over areas that had known little order and no goverment.
Most of them were rough, uncouth men,'' according to an excerpt of
the Marshals' official history by <PERSON>Frederick S. Calhoun</PERSON>.
   The brothers of Deputy <PERSON>Frank Dalton</PERSON>, one of many men killed in
Indian Territory, were also deputies before they turned to robbing
banks.
   ``They were the federal goverment at the local level,'' <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON>
said. ``There was no infrastructure of a bureaucracy, so when the
citizens got mad they took it out on the federal marshals.''
   As a result, as many as 100 marshals and their deputies died in
Indian Territory between <DATE>1872</DATE> and <DATE>1896</DATE>, their deadliest era, <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON>
said.
   ``With the exception of Indian Territory, the far most dangerous
time to be a marshal was in the South after the Civil War,'' <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON>
said. ``If the <PERSON>Ku Klux Klan</PERSON> didn't get you, the moonshiners did.''
   At least 400 and as many as 700 marshals have died in the line of
duty, more than any other law enforcement agency. But the exact
number isn't known because of difficulties in determining whether
members of posses had actually been deputized before their deaths,
said <ORGANIZATION>Marshals Service</ORGANIZATION> director <ORGANIZATION>Stanley Morris</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``At almost every point in history when the federal government
was involved in a significant event, there were marshals
participating,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Marshals Service</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Stephen Boyle</PERSON>.
   A marshal who fired the gun that sent settlers scrambling for a
homestead in the <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> land run of <DATE>1889</DATE> at <LOCATION>Guthrie</LOCATION>; marshals
guarded the first black student at the <ORGANIZATION>University of
Mississippi-Oxford</ORGANIZATION> in the <DATE>1960s</DATE>; and marshals ringed the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION>
during the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> war protests of the early <DATE>1970s</DATE>.
   They arrested gangster <PERSON>Al Capone</PERSON> twice and took the census until
<DATE>1880</DATE>.
   As evidence of those events, the Marshals' exhibit contains the
arrest warrant for Geronimo, an <DATE>1870</DATE> <PERSON>Ku Klux Klan</PERSON> robe and hood from
a recruit in the Klan's birthpace of <LOCATION>Pulaski</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, a <DATE>1790</DATE> whiskey
still from the Whiskey Rebellion era, and one of the two machine
guns from the <ORGANIZATION>St. Valentine</ORGANIZATION>'s Day massacre in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> _ the
bloodiest of Prohibition.
   The exhibit, which will tour a dozen cities over the next 2{
years, also includes a <PERSON>Jesse James</PERSON> vest and sidearm, and original
drawings by <PERSON>Wyatt Earp</PERSON> of four gunfights, including one at the OK
Corral involving the legendary wild West marshal.
   Appointed by the president, the 94 district <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> marshals are a
part of the executive branch, created by the first <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in the
Judiciary Act of <DATE>1789</DATE> _ the same law that established the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme
Court</ORGANIZATION> and the federal judicial system.
   The marshals of the <DATE>1980s</DATE> provide security in federal court and
protect <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> justices when they travel beyond <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
They operate the witness protection program that gives new
identities to those whose lives are jeopardized by testifying for
the government, and track down federal fugitives.
   They also take custody of those accused of federal crimes and
transport federal prisoners, running the government's only scheduled
airline service with two <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> 727s and smaller aircraft out of
their <LOCATION>Oklahoma City</LOCATION> hub, <PERSON>Morris</PERSON> said.
   They are responsible for property seized in the war on drugs and
other federal crimes and have managed horse ranches, restaurants,
condominums, a golf course and a greenhouse.
   With just 3,000 employees, the service is smaller than the <ORGANIZATION>New
York City Police Department</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Morris</PERSON> said, yet its ranks are
stationed in every <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> judicial district from <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> to the <LOCATION>Virgin
Islands</LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Politicians Get 520 Pages of Speech Fodder in New Book of Quotes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Politicians stumped for memorable quotations
to enliven their speeches need look no further than ``Respectfully
Quoted,'' a newly published book from the Library of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> that
is crammed with 2,100 oratorical gems from the past.
   The book might give some comfort to <PERSON>Sen. Joseph Biden</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Del.</LOCATION>,
whose <DATE>1988</DATE> presidential hopes were torpedoed partly by a
controversy over cribbed comments.
   If <PERSON>Biden</PERSON> recalls a famous line from President <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON>'s
inaugural address in <DATE>1961</DATE>, he might be intrigued that Lebanese
writer <PERSON>Kahlil Gibran</PERSON> asked much earlier, ``Are you a politician
asking what your country can do for you, or a zealous one asking
what you can do for your country?''
   The book, a three-year project by <PERSON>Suzy Platt</PERSON> of the library's
congressional reference division, is a compilation of quotations
which members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> or their staffs over the past 75 years
have asked the library to verify for their exact wording and
origins.
   For the hapless politician scrambling to extricate himself from
trouble, there's this reputed quote from former Republican
presidential candidate <PERSON>George Romney</PERSON>: ``I didn't say that I didn't
say it. I said that I didn't say that I said it. I want to make
that very clear.''
   It was <PERSON>Theodore Roosevelt</PERSON> who cast this verbal harpoon at
President <PERSON>John Tyler</PERSON>: ``He has been called a mediocre man, but this
is unwarranted flattery. He was a politician of monumental
littleness.''
   Exasperation prompted former Rep. <PERSON>George E. Danielson</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Calif.</LOCATION>,
to declare that trying to get answers from Attorney General <PERSON>John N.
Mitchell</PERSON> during <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> hearings on the Watergate scandal in <DATE>1974</DATE> was
``like trying to nail a drop of water to the wall.''
   ``These quotations come from the real world of cut-and-thrust
politics,'' says <PERSON>Charles A. Goodrum</PERSON>, former assistant director of
the library's <ORGANIZATION>Congressional Research Service</ORGANIZATION>, which compiled the
520-page dictionary of political quotes. ``They show the
combination of spirit and humor that represents American political
activity at its best.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Platt</PERSON> amassed verified quotations which researchers began
recording on 3-by-5 cards nearly 50 years ago to avoid
time-consuming duplication of efforts. The <ORGANIZATION>CRS</ORGANIZATION> handles more than
1,500 requests for information from <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> every day.
   The researchers discovered that some widely used quotes, now
part of American folklore, are impossible to trace to the person
who first uttered them. Other quotes have been mistakenly
attributed to a few legendary orators, such as <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON>.
   It has never been verified, they say, that Lincoln _ or <PERSON>P.T.
Barnum</PERSON> _ observed that ``you may fool all the people some of the
time; you can even fool some of the people all the time, but you
can't fool all of the people all the time.''
   Who said, ``Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing?'' The
library says it wasn't the late <PERSON>Vince Lombardi</PERSON> but <ORGANIZATION>Red Sanders</ORGANIZATION>,
football coach at <ORGANIZATION>Vanderbilt University</ORGANIZATION>.
   Goodrum said <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> no longer produces thundering, long-winded
orators of the likes of <PERSON>Daniel Webster</PERSON>, <PERSON>Henry Clay</PERSON> or <PERSON>John C.
Calhoun</PERSON>, and that television's insatiable hunger for 20-second
``sound bites'' is largely to blame.
   ``Today's politicians probably aren't as quotable as the
old-time orators who spoke in the measured cadences of the Bible
and Shakespeare,'' he said. ``Even though their quotes don't stand
up so they can be chiseled on marble as clearly, their speeches
reflect some very incisive thinking about the major issues of our
time.''

Each year, 1.5 million visitors view the bronze and marble statues that stand 
throughout the Capitol waiting to be recognized. 
</P>
<P>
Some are well-known. Many are not. 
</P>
<P>
Since <DATE>1864</DATE>, each state has been entitled to donate statues of two of its most 
distinguished deceased citizens for permanent exhibit in the <LOCATION>Capitol</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Once a state legislature decides who is to be honored, a statue is created and 
accepted by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> for a place in the <ORGANIZATION>National Statuary Hall</ORGANIZATION> -- <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s 
hall of fame. 
</P>
<P>
"People are always anxious to see the statues from their state. But often 
they're surprised and disappointed because they have no idea who (the people) 
depicted in the statues are," said <PERSON>Barbara Wolanin</PERSON>, 46, curator of <ORGANIZATION>Statuary 
Hall</ORGANIZATION> since <DATE>1978</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s statues, both dedicated on <DATE>March 1, 1930</DATE>, are of a minister and a 
priest. It is the only state with two statues of clergy. 
</P>
<P>
Most visitors recognize Father <PERSON>Junipero Serra</PERSON>, the Franciscan priest who 
established nine <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> missions before he died in <DATE>1784</DATE>. Father <PERSON>Serra</PERSON>'s 
bronze likeness holds a little mission in his left hand, and in the right, a 
cross, held high above his head. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Thomas Starr King</PERSON> is not so familiar. "What did he do?" Californians typically 
ask when they see the statue. 
</P>
<P>
King, a Unitarian minister, came to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> in <DATE>1860</DATE> from <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> to serve as 
pastor of the <ORGANIZATION>First Unitarian Church of San Francisco</ORGANIZATION>. It was during the Civil 
War and many Californians favored the Confederacy. Of the more than 100 
newspapers in the state, only 24 supported <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"King traveled throughout <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> championing the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> cause. He is 
remembered as the man whose matchless oratory kept <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> in the union," 
curator <PERSON>Wolanin</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
King lived in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> only four years before dying at age 40 in <DATE>1864</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 95 statues from 50 states, 14 are of religious leaders, including Father 
<PERSON>Damien</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>), who devoted his life to lepers on <LOCATION>Molokai</LOCATION>; Father <ORGANIZATION>Kino</ORGANIZATION> 
(<LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>), a Jesuit missionary, and <ORGANIZATION>Brigham Young</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>), the <ORGANIZATION>Mormon Church</ORGANIZATION> 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
Five states -- <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> -- have 
contributed only one statue each. 
</P>
<P>
On <DATE>May 2</DATE>, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> became the latest state to present its second statue, a 7-foot-7 
bronze likeness of lanky <PERSON>Philo T. Farnsworth</PERSON> (1906-1971), known as the "Father 
of Television." The statue shows <PERSON>Farnsworth</PERSON> holding one of his first 
cathode-ray tubes. He transmitted his first electronic TV picture in <DATE>1927</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Students at <ORGANIZATION>Ridgecrest Elementary School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Butler</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, under the guidance of 
Principal <PERSON>Bruce Barnson</PERSON>, led the effort to put the <PERSON>Farnsworth</PERSON> statue in the 
<LOCATION>Capitol</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In a statewide poll conducted by students, residents favored <PERSON>Farnsworth</PERSON> over 20 
other Utahans, including <PERSON>Eliza Snow</PERSON>, a poet and wife of <ORGANIZATION>Brigham Young; Mormon 
Church</ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON>Ezra Taft Benson</PERSON>; hotelier <PERSON>J. Willard Marriott</PERSON>, and heavyweight 
boxing champion <PERSON>Jack Dempsey</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Among those present for <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Norman Bangerter</PERSON>'s unveiling of the statue 
was the inventor's 81-year-old widow, <PERSON>Elma</PERSON> (Pem) <PERSON>Farnsworth</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Three statues are of Presidents: <PERSON>George Washington</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>Andrew Jackson</PERSON> 
(<LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>) and <PERSON>James A. Garfield</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>). Four are of vice presidents, 36 of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
senators, 23 of <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> members, 30 of governors and 32 of military heroes. (Some 
held more than one of these titles.) Six statues honor women: <PERSON>Dr. Florence 
Sabin</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>), author of the "Sabin Health Laws" that modernized <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>'s 
public health system; <PERSON>Frances Willard</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>), founder of the Women's <ORGANIZATION>Christian 
Temperance Union</ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON>Marie Sanford</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Minn.</LOCATION>), educator and champion of women's 
rights; <PERSON>Jeannette Rankin</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Mont.</LOCATION>), the nation's first congresswoman; Mother 
<PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>), a Catholic nun who contributed to the fields of health care, 
education and social work, and <PERSON>Esther Hobart Morris</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Wyo.</LOCATION>), the first woman to 
hold judicial office in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
There are statues of four signers of the Declaration of Independence, and of 
six physicians. A king is here -- Kamehameha (<LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>), and a famed cowboy 
artist -- <PERSON>Charley Russell</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Mont.</LOCATION>). Oklahoma honors two American Indians: 
Sequoya, inventor of the Cherokee alphabet, and <PERSON>Will Rogers</PERSON>, humorist, 
newspaper columnist and movie star. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with <PERSON>Rogers</PERSON>' famous advice to "Always keep an eye on <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to see 
what they're up to," his statue is the only one facing the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> chamber. 
</P>
<P>
The feet of many of the statues gleam from constant rubbing, "for good luck," 
by visitors. Will <PERSON>Rogers</PERSON> has the shiniest feet of all. 
</P>
<P>
There are statues of the president and vice president of the <LOCATION>Confederacy</LOCATION>, 
<PERSON>Jefferson Davis</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Miss.</LOCATION>) and <PERSON>Alexander Hamilton Stephens</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>), respectively, as 
well as of "Father of Refrigeration" <PERSON>John Gorrie</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>), and steamboat inventor 
<PERSON>Robert Fulton</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>). 
</P>
<P>
America's best-known historic figures are here as well: Henry Clay (<LOCATION>Ky.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>Huey 
Long</PERSON> (<LOCATION>La.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>William Jennings Bryan</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Neb.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>Daniel Webster</PERSON> (<LOCATION>N.H.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>Robert E. Lee</PERSON> 
(<LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>Samuel Adams</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>Roger Williams</PERSON> (<LOCATION>R.I.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>John C. Calhoun</PERSON> (<LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>), <LOCATION>Sam 
Houston</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Stephen Austin</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Tex.</LOCATION>), and <PERSON>Ethan Allen</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Vt.</LOCATION>). 
</P>
<P>
Some of the lesser known include <PERSON>Jabez Curry</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>Uriah Rose</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Ark.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>Edmund 
K. Smith</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>George Shoup</PERSON> (Ida.), <PERSON>Samuel Kirkwood</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>), <PERSON>George Glick</PERSON> 
(<LOCATION>Kan.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>Zachariah Chandler</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>Zebulon Vance</PERSON> (<LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>) and <PERSON>Jason Lee</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>). 
Most visitors to <PERSON>Statuary Hall</PERSON> have no idea who they were, the curator said. 
</P>
<P>
"Other people pass away who are much more famous than many in Statuary Hall, 
but the states are stuck with those selected at an earlier time," longtime 
Capitol guide <PERSON>Madeline Allen</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Statuary Hall is in a part of the Capitol completed in <DATE>1807</DATE>, a domed 
semicircular room with sandstone walls and breccia marble columns, a room that 
housed the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> until <DATE>1857</DATE>, when the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> moved to its 
present, larger chamber. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> passed a bill in <DATE>1864</DATE> to create the <ORGANIZATION>National Statuary Hall</ORGANIZATION> to house 
two marble or bronze statues from each state "of deceased persons illustrious 
for their historic renown or for distinguished civic or military services." 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>1870</DATE>, <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> contributed the first statue, Revolutionary War hero 
<PERSON>Nathaniel Greene</PERSON>. By the <DATE>turn of the century</DATE>, 23 were on exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
By <DATE>1933</DATE>, there were 65 statues crowded into <PERSON>Statuary Hall</PERSON>, and it became clear 
that the floor would not support any more. 
</P>
<P>
It was then decided to keep most of the collection in the hall and place the 
others in prominent sites throughout the <LOCATION>Capitol</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Although the statues no longer stand in the same room, this gathering of heroes 
-- famous or not -- continues to be called <ORGANIZATION>National Statuary Hall</ORGANIZATION>.

<DATELINE>BEDFORD SPRINGS, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For nearly two centuries, society's
highest and mightiest flocked to this <LOCATION>Allegheny Mountain</LOCATION> resort to
sip the natural mineral water and soak up elegance at one of
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s oldest spas.
   But the <ORGANIZATION>Bedford Springs Hotel</ORGANIZATION> is foundering these days as its
owners struggle to repay debts and avoid the auction block.
   ``We have the ability to revive something historic and to spur
the economy, and that should sound like government funding would be
available to do that,'' said <PERSON>Hobert Hobbs</PERSON>, 50, vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Sky
Group International Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which owns the hotel.
   Unless an investor comes to the rescue, the resort will be
auctioned off <DATE>Sept. 21</DATE>, nine days before <MONEY>$4.8 million</MONEY> is due the
bank. The money is what was spent from a <MONEY>$7.5 million</MONEY> loan made in
<DATE>1987</DATE> for renovations that weren't completed because of a dispute
between owners that ended up in bankruptcy court.
   Local folks fear that a new owner will raze the 185-year-old
hotel or modernize it to the point that all ambience is lost.
   Merchants in neighboring <LOCATION>Bedford</LOCATION>, a town of about 4,000 people
brimming with antique and art shops, say business already is off <PERCENT>20
percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> as a result of the hotel turmoil. Tourism
accounts for about a third of the area's income, according to <PERSON>Joe
Lurie</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Bedford County Office of Economic
Development</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``It's like losing a big industry,'' he said.
   A few years ago, nearly 200 people worked at <ORGANIZATION>Bedford Springs
Hotel</ORGANIZATION>, a stately stretch of three- and four-story buildings on 2,300
acres in south-central <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>. They tended an 18-hole golf
course, tennis courts, a stocked lake, and hiking and riding trails
during the May-through-October season.
   Forty-seven employees are left. All but 66 of the hotel's 244
rooms are closed to guests, who dine at the golf clubhouse because
the main kitchen is shut down.
   Eight guest rooms were occupied on a recent weeknight, leaving
doorman <PERSON>Joe Koontz</PERSON> with little to do except read.
   ``They (guests) ask me what's going to happen next. Well I don't
know what's going to happen next,'' said <PERSON>Koontz</PERSON>, 61.
   <ORGANIZATION>Bedford Springs Hotel</ORGANIZATION>'s troubles, in part, reflect those of the
entire industry, according to industry observers.
   ``The hotel industry is in deep trouble all around the country,
big time. There are <PERCENT>45 percent</PERCENT> more rooms than demand in the whole
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. It's an overbuilt industry,'' said <PERSON>Phil Goodman</PERSON>,
president of <ORGANIZATION>Western Media Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a marketing company in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Edward Watkins</PERSON>, editor of Lodging Hospitality, a monthly trade
magazine, estimates about 50 of the nation's 45,000 hotels and
motels are ``old-line resorts,'' which offer traditional types of
recreation in a spread-out, rural setting with a meal plan. Only a
dozen or so are 100 years old or more.
   ``The traditional guest they served is getting old and dying
off,'' he said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Bedford Springs Hotel</ORGANIZATION> was opened in <DATE>1804</DATE> by a doctor drawn by
the area's magnesia springs and their reputed curative powers. The
springs had been used for centuries before by Indians.
   The spa quickly attracted the notables of the times: <PERSON>Mrs. John
Quincy Adams</PERSON> and her daughters, <PERSON>Aaron Burr</PERSON>, and statesmen <PERSON>Henry
Clay</PERSON>, <PERSON>John C. Calhoun</PERSON> and <PERSON>Daniel Webster</PERSON>.
   President <PERSON>James Polk</PERSON> visited in <DATE>1848</DATE> followed by five other
presidents, including <PERSON>James Buchanan</PERSON>, who used the spa as a <DATE>summer</DATE>
<ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>. Candidate <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> stayed overnight in <DATE>1974</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> met at the resort to decide a case in
<DATE>1855</DATE>, the only time it ever met outside its chambers. And it was
there in <DATE>1858</DATE> that <PERSON>Buchanan</PERSON> received the first Trans-Atlantic cable,
a message from <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>'s Queen Victoria.
   During World War II, the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> established a radio training school
at the resort. The hotel also housed Japanese diplomats.
   <LOCATION>Bedford Springs</LOCATION> is being considered, along with <ORGANIZATION>State College</ORGANIZATION>, as
a possible <DATE>summer</DATE> home for the <ORGANIZATION>Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra</ORGANIZATION>.
   Hobbs and community leaders hope the orchestra's interest will
prompt the bank to grant a delay on payment of the loan.
   ``We're still confident something good is going to happen,''
<PERSON>Hobbs</PERSON> said. ``Was it <PERSON>Yogi Berra</PERSON> who said, `It ain't over til it's
over?' Well it ain't over til it's over.'''

   The Trouble With Veeps

<LP>
   Though presidential-primary results have yet to register,
it's a sure bet that politicians are already scheming and
cajoling behind the scenes in the hopes of landing the No. 2
spot on the 1992 ticket -- the Republican one, too. This
alone shows how far the much-maligned vice presidency has
come since Daniel Webster, in spurning the Whig nomination in
1848, explained: "I do not propose to be buried until I am
dead."
   Following John C. Calhoun, who was elected the seventh
vice president in 1825, no vice president was nominated to a
second term by a party convention until James S. Sherman, in
1912. As syndicated columnist Jules Witcover puts it in
"Crapshoot: Rolling the Dice on the Vice Presidency" (Crown,
450 pages, $25), through most of our history, the office was
a "certifiable dead end."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Judging by the dreadful bill of particulars <PERSON>Mr. Witcover</PERSON>
has assembled, this was a good thing. The overwhelming
majority of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> veeps have been dim, crooked, lowly and
loutish. Jefferson's vice president, <PERSON>Aaron Burr</PERSON>, was indicted
for murder and tried for treason. Both of <PERSON>Ulysses S. Grant</PERSON>'s
running mates, <PERSON>Schuyler Colfax</PERSON> and <PERSON>Henry Wilson</PERSON>, were
implicated in the Credit Mobilier scandal. <PERSON>Calvin Coolidge</PERSON>
was counting on his veep, <PERSON>Charles Dawes</PERSON>, to break a tie in a
crucial <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> vote -- but <PERSON>Dawes</PERSON> slept through it.
   <PERSON>Herbert Hoover</PERSON>'s No. 2, <PERSON>Charles Curtis</PERSON>, was nicknamed
"Egg" for his wheeling and dealing for the poultry industry.
Under <PERSON>Franklin Roosevelt</PERSON>, the pro-Soviet <PERSON>Henry Wallace</PERSON> liked
to denounce American businessmen as "midget Hitlers." In a
delicious bit of foreshadowing, the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> once said
of <PERSON>Woodrow Wilson</PERSON>'s vice president, <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Thomas
Marshall</PERSON>, "If <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> cannot raise men of presidential
caliber, she should at least try to train them to keep
silence when they have not the mental equipment to fit them
for an understanding of what is required."
   But dating from the tenure of <PERSON>Harry Truman</PERSON>, a scorned vice
president who turned out to be a heroic Cold War leader, the
vice presidency itself has been no joke (the current occupant
notwithstanding). Five of the past nine presidents had first
served as vice presidents, and in six of the past seven
national elections both nominees had first been presidential
understudies. Three -- <PERSON>Truman</PERSON>, <PERSON>Lyndon Johnson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gerald Ford</PERSON>
-- rose to the top spot following presidential death or
disgrace.
   The enhanced chance of today's vice president becoming
tomorrow's president has <PERSON>Mr. Witcover</PERSON> worried. He sees danger
in the slipshod selection process and the indifference of the
electorate.
   The fact is that advances in medicine and security make
the odds of a president dying or being killed in office
slimmer today than in <DATE>1850</DATE>. As for the vice presidency's
giving candidates a leg up in the race for the presidency,
this is due to television exposure and the ability to raise
money. In other words, it is due to politics; <PERSON>Mr. Witcover</PERSON>
writes as though vice presidents ascend through black magic.
   Still, it is deplorable that presidential candidates
continue to select running mates with little regard for their
worthiness as successors: <PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON>, for instance,
tapped <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> because he wanted <PERSON>Mike Mansfield</PERSON> to be <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>
majority leader rather than the treacherous LBJ. <PERSON>Richard
Nixon</PERSON> chose candidates who wouldn't outshine him, <PERSON>Spiro Agnew</PERSON>
and <PERSON>Mr. Ford</PERSON>. <PERSON>George McGovern</PERSON>, turned down by his first two
choices and unable to reach the third on the telephone,
picked the eventually discredited <PERSON>Sen. Thomas Eagleton</PERSON> on a
lark, thus ensuring that background checks would be part of
all future selections.
   <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> was no different from the pack in his choice
of <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON>. But <PERSON>Mr. Witcover</PERSON>'s partisanship keeps him from
recognizing this, as he insists against his own evidence that
<PERSON>Mr. Quayle</PERSON> is uniquely unfit for higher office. He gives us
surely the most exhaustive list of <PERSON>Mr. Quayle</PERSON>'s gaffes in
print, but his portrait of the man is cursory and flat, and
he has almost nothing to say about <PERSON>Mr. Quayle</PERSON>'s substantive
record in the vice presidency, which is more impressive than
most of his predecessors'. (Even the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post has
recognized this, leaving <PERSON>Mr. Witcover</PERSON> trailing behind the
Beltway's sluggish conventional wisdom.)
   One does not have to be a fan of <PERSON>Mr. Quayle</PERSON>'s to see that
<PERSON>Mr. Witcover</PERSON>'s huffing and puffing comes down to this: "What
if <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON>, feeling his oats and prodded by his right-wing
constituency, brought in more doctrinaire conservatives to
restore the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> Revolution they feel was abandoned by
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON>?" Personally, I think it would be pretty wonderful.
   The author is angry that the voters didn't punish <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON>
for his choice. But for better or worse, vice presidents have
hardly ever made a difference one way or the other on
Election Day. To remedy this, <PERSON>Mr. Witcover</PERSON> wants to rob
voters of their right not to care. A new president would
submit his or her vice presidential nominee to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> for
confirmation after the election, thereby eliminating
"blatantly political considerations" now impinging on the
choice. The idea that <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> could make a decision free of
partisan politics, much less of character assassination, is
one that could only be held by a liberal <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>
columnist.

<TEXT>
   At 400 pounds, <PERSON>Sen. Dixon Hall Lewis</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>
was the weightiest person ever to serve in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON>, a Democrat who served first in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, then in the
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, was so heavy he had difficulty finding a carriage driver
willing to take the risk of hauling all those pounds.
   Once, wrote <PERSON>Isaac Bassett</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>'s assistant doorkeeper for
much of the <DATE>19th century</DATE>, <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> ``got into a hack and went right
through the bottom, onto the ground _ and if the horses had not been
very tame he would have been killed.''
   <PERSON>Sen. Lewis</PERSON> _ and the extreme rotundity of his profile _ is
presiding this <DATE>summer</DATE> over the marble-clad rotunda of the <ORGANIZATION>Russell
Senate Office Building</ORGANIZATION>, looming from a balcony in the form of a
giant, shadow-casting silhouette.
   <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> and the silhouettes of six of his senatorial colleagues of
his era form the somewhat whimsical background of an exhibit
illustrating the triumph and travail experienced by the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> in
its first 100 years, 1789-1889.
   Born in <DATE>1802</DATE>, <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> served in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> for 15 years. He was
appointed to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1844</DATE>, dying <DATE>four years later</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Bassett</PERSON>, who made good use of his powers of observation during
his 60 years of service to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, noted that <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> rarely rose
from his specially constructed and commodious chair to address the
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.
   Bassett wrote that <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> told him the reason ``was that he was so
big and fat that I would have to fan him, and it would not look very
dignified in such a body as the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.''
   But if <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> was an infrequent speaker, he did listen intently to
the major addresses of others.
   On <DATE>Jan. 26, 1830</DATE>, he walked across the Capitol and joined the
throng crowding into the chamber of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, determined to hear
<PERSON>Sen. Daniel Webster</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> defend the federal union.
   The ``enormous'' congressman was given a seat in the tiny lobby
behind the presiding officer's chair where he became wedged in by
other spectators.
   Because he was separated from the chamber by a painted glass
screen, he could hear <PERSON>Webster</PERSON> but could not see him.
   Describing the scene, <PERSON>Bassett</PERSON> said the frustrated congressman
``deliberately pulled out his knife and removed the obstructing
paint on the glass.''
   But the operation ``caused quite a noise,'' <PERSON>Bassett</PERSON> said.
``Everybody was looking to see where that scratching came from.''
   Finally, <PERSON>Bassett</PERSON> said, <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> cleared an area ``as large as a
man's hand,'' obtaining a ``good view'' of the famous <PERSON>Webster</PERSON>.
   The senatorial silhouettes, originally made on paper during the
<DATE>1840s</DATE> and <DATE>1850s</DATE> and now reproduced larger than life, bring together
an unuusal cast of characters.
   Joining <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> in larger-than-life profile is, for example, <PERSON>Sen.
John Randolph</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, a thin, stick-like figure described as
``one of the most brilliant, deranged and pathetic men ever to serve
in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.''
   <PERSON>Randolph</PERSON> was known to stride into the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> followed by a pack
of hunting hounds while flicking a riding crop and drinking a cup of
beer.
   Abusive in speech, he once provoked a duel with <PERSON>Sen. Henry Clay</PERSON>
from which both men emerged unscathed.
   Randolph lived to be 99, dying in <DATE>1833</DATE> just days before his 100th
birthday.
   Also on the railing above the rotunda floor is a far less
colorful lawmaker, <PERSON>Sen. Felix Grundy</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>, who was described
by doorkeeper <PERSON>Bassett</PERSON> as a consummate insider and master of
parliamentary tactics.
   Near <LOCATION>Grundy</LOCATION> is <PERSON>Sen. John Forsyth</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> who cut a more
visible public swath with blistering oratory and cutting wit.
   Informed that President <PERSON>Andrew Jackson</PERSON>'s opponents were forming
the new Whig party, <PERSON>Forsyth</PERSON> remarked:
   ``It is a glorious name, and I have no doubt they will disgrace
it.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Senate Barbers Shaved Senators _ and Taxpayers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A shave and a haircut used to cost nothing, if
you were a <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> senator and were shaved and trimmed in the
<LOCATION>United States Senate</LOCATION> barber shop.
   And when one reform-minded senator tried to eliminate free
senatorial shaving and hair cutting 37 years ago, his
shaved-for-free colleagues rebelled.
   The senator was the late <PERSON>Paul Douglas</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, and his
experience was recalled in a recent <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> speech by <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>
Republican leader <PERSON>Bob Dole</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>.
   Douglas had gone to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> barber shop for a haircut.
   ``After the barber had done his work,'' said <PERSON>Dole</PERSON>, ``<PERSON>Douglas</PERSON>
began to think that his income was ample enough to pay for his own
haircut _ which then cost a dollar and a quarter _ and not charge
it to the taxpayer.''
   So <PERSON>Douglas</PERSON> introduced an amendment to the annual legislative
appropriations act to cut off funds for the barber shop unless it
began charging senators for its services.
   The counterattack was not long coming.
   At a <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> hearing, <PERSON>Sen. Carl Hayden</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> complimented
<PERSON>Douglas</PERSON> on his haircut, then recalled that the haircut issue was
one that flared from time to time.
   <PERSON>Hayden</PERSON> said that when he first came to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> he became
disturbed at newspaper articles complaining about free senatorial
haircuts and discussed the matter with <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> veteran <PERSON>William Borah</PERSON>
of <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>.
   ``Senator <PERSON>Borah</PERSON> said, `You tell that reporter to go to the
devil. I want the same service that was received here by <PERSON>Henry Clay</PERSON>
and <PERSON>John C. Calhoun</PERSON>.'''
   Dole picked up the story, saying, ``After a good laugh, the
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> shouted down Senator <PERSON>Douglas</PERSON>' amendment, and the free
haircut survived.''
   But only for the monent.
   ``I want to assure taxpayers that today senators pay their own
way when they have their hair cut, as Senator <PERSON>Douglas</PERSON> tried and
failed to accomplish 37 years ago,'' <PERSON>Dole</PERSON> said.
   While they pay more than a dollar and a quarter, the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>
barbering charges may be a bit gentler than those of most
commercial barbershops.
   The current charge for a haircut in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> barbershop is
<MONEY>$4.50</MONEY>.
   More elaborate cuts are <MONEY>$6.50</MONEY>. Hair styling costs <MONEY>$9.00</MONEY>.
   A shave costs <MONEY>$4.00</MONEY>.

   Those last hearings before the confirmation of Justice
Thomas were a sordid spectacle. It may not be entirely
Pollyannaish, however, to note certain useful byproducts. The
nation's consciousness on the subject of sexual harassment
was significantly raised; about time, too. Moreover, the
television audience saw a succession of competent, posed,
well-spoken black witnesses who disagreed among themselves;
this should undermine the David Duke impression that black
leaders all dress up in African costumes and spout a racial
party line while the rank and file mug people in the streets.
   That about exhausts the good news. The hearings provoked
widespread titillation and disgust. Our national
self-righteousness demands a scapegoat, anyone but ourselves,
and is finding it in Congress. The Thomas confirmation
hearings come as a culmination of a series of scandals on the
Hill -- overdrafts at the House bank, unpaid bills at the
House restaurant, free massages in the House gym, fixed
parking tickets, junkets abroad, wine, women and song --
practices in which the rest of the population of course never
indulges. According to the New York Times/CBS News Poll, a
sizable number of Americans now see their national
legislators as generally pampered, arrogant and crooked.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Most of the practices under criticism are indeed
objectionable; and it is quite reasonable to hold members of
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to higher standards than we hold investment bankers,
stock manipulators, savings and loan operators and other
emblems of the private sector. Certainly the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Judiciary
Committee</ORGANIZATION> did not distinguish itself in the Thomas hearings.
   Yet it is a little hard, it seems to me, to place all the
blame for the mess on the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>. Surely a considerable share
must go to the man who presented the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> with such a
dubious nomination. The <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> today is the most
undistinguished in my lifetime. In the past, presidents have
sought out people of national experience and distinction for
elevation to the court -- cabinet members, senators,
governors, eminent jurists, leaders of the bar, great legal
scholars. Even the reactionary justices who tried to kill the
<LOCATION>New Deal</LOCATION> half a century ago included men of intellectual
force like <PERSON>George Sutherland</PERSON>, <PERSON>Willis Vandevanter</PERSON> and <PERSON>Owen
Roberts</PERSON>. Today dimness seems almost a prerequisite for
appointment.
   <PERSON>Clarence Thomas</PERSON> is the third mediocrity in a row. It was a
cynical choice. The president called him "the best man for
the job on the merits" and denied that his race was a
consideration. But had <PERSON>Clarence Thomas</PERSON> been a white man with
the same qualifications, it is not very likely that he would
have been appointed. The opponent of affirmative action
ironically became the beneficiary of affirmative action.
   All presidents naturally enough appoint justices who they
believe will give their own views of public policy a
sympathetic hearing. But responsible presidents also have
some regard for the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> as an institution. When
their own predilections command a safe majority, they
sometimes take care to preserve the court's appearance of
impartiality by providing for other viewpoints. A rigidly
ideological and partisan <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> loses credibility and
falls into discredit. That is what happened to the "nine old
men" in the <DATE>1930s</DATE>. Balance is a reasonable consideration in
making appointments for life to the highest court in the
land.
   Thus <PERSON>Herbert Hoover</PERSON>, even if with reluctance, appointed
the great liberal justice <PERSON>Benjamin Cardozo</PERSON>. <PERSON>Franklin
Roosevelt</PERSON> made <PERSON>Calvin Coolidge</PERSON>'s attorney general his chief
justice. <PERSON>Harry Truman</PERSON> appointed <PERSON>Harold Burton</PERSON>, a Republican.
<PERSON>Dwight Eisenhower</PERSON> appointed <PERSON>William Brennan</PERSON>, a Democrat. But
<PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> is not a lawyer and does not perhaps fully
appreciate the role of the court. One fears that he regards
judicial appointments as a convenient way of getting the hard
right off his back and thereby gaining a free hand on matters
that really interest him, like foreign policy. Had he
nominated someone like <PERSON>John Harlan</PERSON> or <PERSON>Lewis Powell</PERSON> or his
good friend <PERSON>Potter Stewart</PERSON>, none of this mess would have
happened.
   In the meantime, everyone is mad at <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>; and the
remedy of choice these days is term limitation. A number of
states have already adopted term limitation for their own
legislatures. Some states seek to impose limitations on their
representatives in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> as well -- a proposal of highly
dubious constitutionality, even given the present court.
According to the Gallup Poll, <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT> of American voters wish to
limit congressional terms.
   The argument is that limitation to a maximum 12 years of
service in either house would end the seniority system, shift
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> from constituent service to policy-making,
revitalize party competition, ensure a constant influx of new
legislators with new ideas and force legislators to pay
attention to the national interest rather than to their own
re-election.
   Well, perhaps. But the most certain result would be to
tilt the balance of the constitutional system even more in
favor of the executive. It is hard to imagine a greater boon
for the Imperial Presidency than to purge <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> of
experienced legislators who are specialists in issues, who
know the workings of government and who remember where bodies
are buried. What president would not prefer a revolving-door
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> filled with amateurs learning the ropes from scratch
and condemned to vanish when they have gained the experience
to be effective? Alas, it is not true, as <PERSON>William Jennings
Bryan</PERSON> is supposed to have said, that any man with sufficient
goodness of heart can write a currency bill.
   The Founding Fathers considered and rejected proposals of
term limitation. They were right to do so. It would have made
quite a difference to American history if such limitations
had ended after 12 years the careers of such illustrious
legislators as <PERSON>Henry Clay</PERSON>, <PERSON>Daniel Webster</PERSON>, <PERSON>John C. Calhoun</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Thomas Hart Benton</PERSON>, <PERSON>Charles Sumner</PERSON>, <PERSON>James G. Blaine</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Henry
Cabot Lodge</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Robert M. LaFollette</PERSON>, <PERSON>George W. Norris</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sam
Rayburn</PERSON>, <PERSON>Robert P. Wagner</PERSON>, <PERSON>William E. Borah</PERSON>, <PERSON>Arthur
Vandenberg</PERSON>, <PERSON>George Aiken</PERSON>, <PERSON>Robert A. Taft</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jacob Javits</PERSON> and so
many others.
   Term limitations would bounce from our present <ORGANIZATION>Congress
Tom Foley</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Lee Hamilton</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sam Nunn</PERSON>, <PERSON>Daniel Patrick Moynihan</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Richard Lugar</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bill Bradley</PERSON>, <PERSON>Stephen Solarz</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bill Green</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Charles Rangel</PERSON>, <PERSON>Tom Downey</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bob Michel</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dick Gephardt</PERSON>, <PERSON>Les
Aspin</PERSON> and other skilled legislators. Their replacement by
fresh-faced and untutored novices would unquestionably
increase presidential power, but would it really improve the
performance of the American government?
   One hears that the automatic return of incumbents is a
horrid new phenomenon. But recall the election of <DATE>1790</DATE>, where
38 out of 41 incumbent congressmen were reelected; or <DATE>1792</DATE>,
when all 45 incumbents were re-elected; or <DATE>1866</DATE>, when <PERCENT>85%</PERCENT> of
the incumbents seeking re-election made it; or <DATE>1934</DATE>, when 388
members ran and 325 were re-elected.
   Throughout American history, according to the
authoritative study by <PERSON>David Huckabee</PERSON>, the proportion of
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> incumbents running for re-election who were returned to
office has dropped below <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT> only seven times and has
exceeded <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> most of the time. As <PERSON>Mr. Huckabee</PERSON> concludes,
"Incumbents who have sought reelection apparently have always
been relatively successful." As for the alleged tyranny of
incumbency today, hardly half of today's senators were
senators 10 years ago, and less than half the members of the
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> were members 10 years ago.
   When you think about it, the whole idea of term
limitations is profoundly anti-democratic. It assumes that
the quest for reelection corrupts legislators and that they
will better serve the national interest when they ignore the
wishes of their constituents. It assumes that the less
accountable a member of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> is to popular desires and
needs, the better legislator he will be. It assumes, in
short, that the democratic process itself is the enemy of the
public interest.
   Surely a democracy requires a legislature that listens to
the people, not a legislature that couldn't care less about
the people. The desire to be re-elected, as <PERSON>Alexander
Hamilton</PERSON> wrote in the 72nd Federalist, gives the elected
official "the inclination and the resolution to act his part
well" and gives the voters opportunity to assess his
performance. When they approve his conduct, they can
"continue him in his office, in order to prolong the utility
of his talents and virtues, and to secure to the government
the advantage of permanency in a wise system of
administration." Term limitation, <PERSON>Hamilton</PERSON> said, "would be a
diminution of the inducements to good behavior." It would
increase "the temptation to sordid view, to peculation, and,
in some instances, to usurpation."
   If democratic government is about anything, it is about
the unfettered right of the voters to choose those who govern
them. Term limitation, by assuming that voters are too dumb
to choose wisely, is an insult to the people. Term
limitation, by weakening the power of the legislative branch
to counterbalance the executive branch, would be an injury to
the republic. And term limitation distracts attention from
the search for answers to the very grave substantive problems
that afflict and enfeeble the nation.

   <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> marshals live in legend as the
men who tamed the Wild West, but their 200-year career is
intertwined with more of the country's history than just bringing
bandits to justice.
   The country's oldest law enforcement organization looks back at
its storied history today as it begins a bicentennial celebration
with the opening of an exhibit at the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> and a black-tie
gala at a nearby hotel.
   ``At almost every point in history when the federal government
was involved in a significant event, there were marshals
participating,'' says <PERSON>Stephen Boyle</PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Marshals Service</ORGANIZATION>.
   A marshal fired the gun that sent settlers scrambling for a
homestead in the <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> land run of <DATE>1889</DATE>; marshals guarded the
first black student at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Mississippi</ORGANIZATION> during the
desegregation battles of the <DATE>1960s</DATE>; they ringed the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> during
the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> war protests of the early <DATE>1970s</DATE>.
   They smashed whiskey stills during Prohibition and arrested
gangster <PERSON>Al Capone</PERSON> twice; took the census until <DATE>1880</DATE>; captured
fugitive slaves before the Civil War and protected freed slaves
during Reconstruction; and did the hanging for ``Hanging Judge''
<PERSON>Isaac Parker</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Fort Smith</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ark.</LOCATION>, when <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> was still Indian
Territory and bank and train robbers hid in the brush.
   ``This is our heritage, the preservation of history,'' said <PERSON>Clint
Peoples</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Waco</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. Peoples is the executive marshal for the
bicentennial, and served as a marshal for 15 years in <LOCATION>North Texas</LOCATION>
and as chief of the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Rangers</ORGANIZATION>.
   Sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION>United States Marshals Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit
fund-raising organization, the special guest at tonight's event will
be <PERSON>James Arness</PERSON>, who played Marshal <PERSON>Matt Dillon</PERSON> on television's
``Gunsmoke'' for 20 years. One of those being honored is Deputy
Marshal <PERSON>Rey F. Cestero</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Savannah</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, for his assistance in
apprehending two murder and abduction suspects in <DATE>August</DATE>.
   Included in the exhibit, organized with the help of the
<ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian</ORGANIZATION> Institution, are the arrest warrant for Geronimo, an
<DATE>1870</DATE> <PERSON>Ku Klux Klan</PERSON> robe from the Klan's birthplace of <LOCATION>Pulaski</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>,
a <DATE>1790</DATE> still from the Whiskey Rebellion era, and one of the two
machine guns from the <ORGANIZATION>St. Valentine</ORGANIZATION>'s Day massacre in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> _ the
bloodiest of Prohibition.
   The exhibit, which will tour a dozen cities over the next 2{
years, also includes a <PERSON>Jesse James</PERSON> vest and sidearm, and original
drawings by the legendary <PERSON>Wyatt Earp</PERSON> of four gunfights including one
at the <ORGANIZATION>OK Corral</ORGANIZATION>.
   During their first 100 years, marshals ``were the federal
government at the local level,'' says marshals historian <PERSON>Frederick
S. Calhoun</PERSON>. ``There was no infrastructure of a bureaucracy, so when
the citizens got mad, they took it out on the federal marshals.''
   Partly as a result, at least 400 and as many as 700 people in the
<ORGANIZATION>Marshals Service</ORGANIZATION> died in the line of duty, more casualties than in
any other law enforcement agency, officials say. The reason they
lack specific numbers is that officials are unsure whether all those
who died had been deputized or were simply parts of posses and that
``makes it very fuzzy,'' said <PERSON>Stanley Morris</PERSON>, director of the
<ORGANIZATION>Marshals Service</ORGANIZATION>.
   Appointed by the president, the 94 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> marshals are a part of
the executive branch, created by the first <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in the Judiciary
Act of <DATE>1789</DATE> _ the same law that established the federal judicial
system.
   The marshals of the <DATE>1980s</DATE> provide security in federal courts, and
protect <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> justices when they travel beyond <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
They track down federal fugitives and operate the witness protection
program that gives new identities to those whose lives are
jeopardized by testifying for the government.
   They also are responsible for property seized in the war on drugs
and other federal offenses, and currently have three-quarters of a
<MONEY>billion dollars</MONEY> in their inventory, <PERSON>Boyle</PERSON> said. Marshals have
managed horse ranches, restaurants, condominiums, a golf course and
a greenhouse taken in such raids.
   With just the 94 marshals, aided by some 2,000 deputies and about
1,000 support staff, the service is smaller than the <ORGANIZATION>New York City
Police Department</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Morris</PERSON> said, yet its ranks are spread across
every <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> judicial district from <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> to the <LOCATION>Virgin Islands</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON>, who has a doctorate in history from the <ORGANIZATION>University of
Chicago</ORGANIZATION>, says the deadliest era in the service's history was before
<LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> statehood, when about 100 marshals died in Indian territory
between <DATE>1872</DATE> and <DATE>1896</DATE>.
   ``With the exception of Indian Territory, the far most dangerous
time to be a marshal was in the South after the Civil War,'' <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON>
said. ``If the <PERSON>Ku Klux Klan</PERSON> didn't get you, the moonshiners did.''

<HL> The First 'Heartbeat Away' Succession </HL>
<AUTHOR> Barry Sparks </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<TEXT>
   Whether <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON> or <PERSON>Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> becomes vice president, the precise duties of the position they are seeking will be, as always, unclear. 
But the job does carry with it a sobering potential responsibility: to succeed the president in case of death, resignation or impeachment. 

   This fact has given vital significance to the public scrutiny of Messrs. 
<PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> and to their debate last week. 
But for the first 50 years of our nation's history, the position of vice president held no such importance: According to the way many political leaders of those years read the Constitution, there was no clear line of succession. 
No president had died in office, so the issue never had come up. 

   However, when the ninth president, <PERSON>William Henry Harrison</PERSON>, died a month after taking office in <DATE>1841</DATE>, there arose around his vice president, <PERSON>John Tyler</PERSON>, one of the fiercest political controversies in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> history. 
There was, of course, no precedent for whether the vice president should be accorded the full power of the president or be regarded simply as acting chief executive. 
And the Constitution's language contributed to the problem, stating that "in case of the removal of the President from office or his death, resignation or inability to discharge the powers and duties of said office, the same shall devolve on the vice-president." 

   Did "the same" mean the office or the duties? 
Tyler said it meant the office, but his interpretation was not accepted by all Whig or Democratic leaders, newspaper editors or even his own inherited cabinet. 
Many maintained that the Founding Fathers did not intend the office to devolve on the vice president, just the duties. 

   Despite the doubts, <PERSON>Tyler</PERSON> acted decisively. 
<PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> died at <TIME>12:30 a.m.</TIME> on <DATE>Sunday, April 4</DATE>. 
Tyler, who had returned to his home in <LOCATION>Williamsburg</LOCATION> following the inauguration, rode 53 hours on horseback after receiving the news of <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON>'s death. 
He reached <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> around <TIME>5 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Tuesday, April 6</DATE>, convinced that he was the actual president, not an ad interim administrator. 
He felt the oath that he had taken as vice president was sufficient to assume the office of president, but in order to forestall any problems, he took a second oath. 
He was sworn into office by <PERSON>William Cranch</PERSON>, chief judge of the circuit court of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> Chief Justice <PERSON>Roger Taney</PERSON> was nearby in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>, but refused to administer the oath because he hadn't been officially requested to do so. 

   As a vice presidential candidate on the Whig ticket, <PERSON>Tyler</PERSON> had done little campaigning, and he was not perceived as an important leader by politicians or the public. 
In fact, in the famous <DATE>1840</DATE> campaign slogan -- "Tippecanoe and Tyler Too" -- his name came as a sort of afterthought. 
As vice president, he had been expected to have little responsibility. 

   Now that he claimed the presidency, he met strong resistance, especially from former President <PERSON>John Quincy Adams</PERSON>, who insisted that <PERSON>Tyler</PERSON> was merely an "acting president." 
Adams felt <PERSON>Tyler</PERSON>'s ascent to the presidency was "in direct violation both of grammar and context of the Constitution." 

   Certainly the Whigs were stunned by the turn of events. 
In Tyler, they found themselves with a party leader who subscribed to few, if any, of their policies. 
Tyler had been a Democrat and was still a Democrat at heart who supported states' rights and opposed a national bank, in direct contrast to the beliefs of <PERSON>Henry Clay</PERSON>, the most powerful Whig. 

   Tyler held firm and won the day, although nearly six weeks after taking office his official status was still being questioned by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. 
On <DATE>May 31</DATE>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON>John McKeon</PERSON> rose in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> to inquire if Tyler was indeed officially the "president." 

   Not surprisingly, <PERSON>Tyler</PERSON>'s nearly four-year term as president was a stormy one. 
He was constantly at odds with the Whigs, who controlled both houses. 
They were especially angered by his repeated vetoes of the national bank and high-tariff bills. 
Eventually, the Whigs disowned and denounced him, leading <PERSON>Henry Clay</PERSON> to call him the "president without a party." 

   Dissatisfaction with <PERSON>Tyler</PERSON> eventually led to impeachment proceedings against him, the first president to be so dubiously honored. 
The impeachment resolution, however, was defeated, 127-83, in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Despite all his problems, <PERSON>Tyler</PERSON> decided to run for re-election in <DATE>1844</DATE> as a Democrat. 
He was nominated at a <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> convention, but was persuaded to withdraw from the campaign <DATE>several months later</DATE>. 
This move was thought to have helped elect Democrat "dark horse" <PERSON>James Polk</PERSON> while defeating <PERSON>Tyler</PERSON>'s nemesis <PERSON>Henry Clay</PERSON>.

<HEAD>Court Upholds IRS Ruling Denying Tax Exempt Status to All-White
School</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Tax Court</ORGANIZATION> has upheld an <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> order
denying a tax exemption to a <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> private school on
grounds it discriminates against blacks.
   ``The absence of either a single black student in the school or
a plausible explanation of inability to attract black students
permits an inference of discrimination, particularly in view of ...
(the school's) history,'' the court held.
   The decision, made public <DATE>Monday</DATE>, means that contributions to
<ORGANIZATION>Calhoun Academy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>St. Matthews</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, are not deductible.
   Chief <PERSON>Judge Arthur L. Nims III</PERSON> held that although <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> had
adopted a racially non-discriminatory policy, the school had failed
to operate under that policy.
   ``We cannot conclude that non-discrimination in ... operations
is more likely than discrimination,'' <PERSON>Nims</PERSON> wrote for the court.
   <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON>, organized as a not-for-profit corporation <DATE>Dec. 30,
1969</DATE>, offers classes for grades kindergarten through 12. The school
has never had a black pupil or teacher. Two black parents requested
and were given application forms for enrollment in <DATE>1984-85</DATE>, but a
black teacher has never applied for employment.
   Since <DATE>1982</DATE>, at least one pupil of Oriental background has been
enrolled in <LOCATION>Calhoun</LOCATION>. The only non-white teacher, a
Japanese-American, was hired in <DATE>1983</DATE>, court records showed.
   The school amended its charter in <DATE>1985</DATE> and began advertising
that it did not discriminate. It applied to the <ORGANIZATION>Internal Revenue
Service</ORGANIZATION> for a tax exemption in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> denied the exemption, citing the fact that <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> was
formed at a time of enforced desegregation in area public schools,
its total lack of black pupils despite blacks being a majority in
<LOCATION>Calhoun County</LOCATION> and its failure to announce a policy of
non-discrimination until <DATE>1985</DATE>.
   At a later meeting, the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> suggested that <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> improve its
contacts with the black community and offer reduced tuition for
black pupils. A director of the school rejected the reduced-tuition
suggestion, saying it would result in unequal treatment on the
basis of race.
   In siding with the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Tax Court</ORGANIZATION> cited a <DATE>1983</DATE> case in which
the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> had stripped a tax exemption from <ORGANIZATION>Bob Jones
University</ORGANIZATION> after finding that it discriminated on the basis of race.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> held that racially discriminatory schools
violate fundamental public policy and cannot be viewed as
conferring a benefit on the public.
   ``From the record before us,'' <PERSON>Nims</PERSON> wrote, ``it appears that
white students and their parents gravitate to petitioner (<PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON>)
at least in part because of a historical absence of black students:
Petitioner admits that the local public schools are superior in
material respects, yet considerably less expensive.
   ``Petitioner's survival would thus depend to some extent on
perpetuating its history,'' the court ruled, adding that such
discrimination would clearly preclude a federal tax exemption.

   There are no individual heroes in this account of a juicy slice of American history, not even <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Jefferson</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Madison</PERSON> or <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>. 
Its only hero is the American people, who are celebrated with ardor in rich and dense detail. 

   The merit of Oscar and <PERSON>Lilian Handlin</PERSON>'s "Liberty in Expansion: 1760-1850" (<ORGANIZATION>Harper &amp; Row</ORGANIZATION>, 481 pages, <MONEY>$25.95</MONEY>) is that it treats the grand theme of freedom in American history by keeping it close to the earth of everyday living. 
The present book is the second of their planned four-volume history of "Liberty in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>: <DATE>1600</DATE> to the Present," an ambitious project that bears witness to the American romance with freedom over the centuries. 

   The Handlins avoid grand theory and theorists. 
Liberty, they say, does not lie in concepts, thinkers or leaders, but in the experience of the people as they pursue the conditions of a good life. 
Out of this pursuit, liberty has emerged, almost as an afterthought. 

   The theme of migration, with its ethnicities and pluralisms, is the thread running through the lifelong work of the senior author, <PERSON>Oscar Handlin</PERSON> -- all the way from his early "<LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>'s Immigrants" (<DATE>1941</DATE>) and his Pulitzer-winning "The Uprooted" (<DATE>1951</DATE>). 
The present series fuses that theme with the story of liberty. 
I must add that no other major historian has aimed so persistently at a pointillism that turns the specific Whitmanesque points of light into a general picture of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. 

   The best way to read "Liberty in Expansion" is to start, perversely, with the 15-page epilogue in which the authors explain their method with a touch of belligerence. 
To study a "vast population . . . without obscuring their identities," they say, don't start with a "paradigm or model" of your own. 
Examine the "residues," "detritus" and "shards" left behind -- the tracts, pamphlets, newspapers, public records, letters, diaries, memoirs, advertisements, orations. 
After a time "contours" will appear, then "larger structures." 
Don't impose the patterns. 
Let the patterns emerge. 
Flee dualisms and dichotomies such as ideologies and class, consensus and conflict, frontier and imperialism, <PERSON>Hamilton</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON>, Republicans and Federalists, Democrats and Whigs, agrarian and mercantile. 
And don't lose yourself in a search for foreign sources of influence, whether <PERSON>John Locke</PERSON> or <PERSON>David Hume</PERSON>. 
The influences are likely to be home-grown, coming out of the American grain. 

   This is an appealing form of historical populism in its literal sense. 
The danger is that it can become a cult of the people, like <PERSON>Carl Sandburg</PERSON>'s effusive "The People, Yes." 
Surely it asks too much of the "shards" of history, embedded in the mounds of raw evidence, to form their own pattern and to offer not only text and context for interpretation, but also the interpretation itself. 

   The result is a radical dissolvent of traditional history as narrative. 
There is no sequential account of the <ORGANIZATION>American Revolution</ORGANIZATION> here. 
The experience of the Revolution becomes a discipline in liberty and fortitude in the face of scarcities, confusions and suffering. 
We get no account of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and his generals but we get the pithy conclusion, from the evidence, that the Revolution "created something like a General Will." 

   The Constitution offers a similar test. 
Instead of seeing it as an act of creation by a remarkable group of framers, drawing on great 18th-century philosophers, the authors see only a group of "practical men" -- lawyers, merchants, planters -- moved by a fear of disorder in their daily lives, determined to create a structure of order. 
The resulting "social contract" was not only in the document and its judicial interpretations, but in the daily lives of nameless men. 

   This is the mood and method the authors apply as well to the first half of the new century. 
We get very little about <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Clay</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> and <PERSON>Webster</PERSON> -- the "Bigs" -- and much about the threat of disorder, the behavior of juries, and the treatment of two "enclaves" -- of the slaves and of Indians, who were pushed out of their forests and life ways by intolerance and treachery. 
We get the building of an infrastructure of toll roads, canals and railroads because they met the needs of the people. 
We get the greeds and cruelties, the tinkering, inventing and creating, the sectional compromises and the shadows that loomed beyond the compromises. 

   This is rich stuff. 
Yet I wish the Handlins -- so good at the interpretations that somehow emerge -- had given us more of them. 
They scorn the emphasis of historians on elites, but willy-nilly, their pages show plenty of talented and passionate Americans -- abolitionists, professional politicians, newspaper editors, preachers, feminists -- who keep pushing through the humdrum of life to wield a disproportionate influence on events. 
The vignettes they give us of extraordinary people -- <PERSON>Samuel Adams</PERSON>, <PERSON>Martin Van Buren</PERSON>, the black freeman <PERSON>Frederick Douglass</PERSON>, the preacher <PERSON>James F. Clarke</PERSON>, the Indian warrior Tecumseh -- are so sharp in their brevity as to warrant more expansive treatment. 

   In their anti-Carlylean rejection of the "Bigs," the authors fall into a dichotomy trap of their own, an either/or between the "people" and the creative individual shapers of American history, the Madisons and Emersons. 
This is one area in which they should have given us a both/and. 
It is in the dialogue between the people and their leaders that liberty is pursued and achieved. 
Like God, liberty is in the details.

   No Field of Dreams, but Bettern than '88

   Two men join the Democratic presidential race this week.
One is Bill Clinton, a relatively obscure Arkansas governor
who is sometimes confused with DeWitt Clinton, the visionary
New York governor who built the Erie Canal. The other is Bob
Kerrey, a Nebraska senator who is so little known that
newspaper stories about him often are accompanied by pictures
of Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts.
   The group of candidates -- which also includes Sen. Tom
Harkin of Iowa, former Sen. Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts and
Gov. Douglas Wilder of Virginia -- is no field of dreams. For
months, the Democrats' first team stood up, one by one, and
stood down from the race. Jay Rockefeller's not ready, Dick
Gephardt's not inclined, Al Gore's not willing, Lloyd
Bentsen's not disposed. The best that can be said for Mario
Cuomo, the Democrats' best shadowboxer, is that he's not
clear.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But candidate for candidate, the Democrats, who had the
presidency within reach <DATE>four years ago</DATE>, are fielding a more
interesting and in many ways stronger group of candidates in
<DATE>1992</DATE> than they did in <DATE>1988</DATE>.
   Take them by genre:
   -- The accomplished governor. Last season's entry, <PERSON>Michael
Dukakis</PERSON>, had three terms as governor and trumpeted his
success fashioning a <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> Miracle. But that miracle,
which even then had the whiff of a mirage about it, was
fueled by the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> economic boom if not by the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>
defense buildup, and it occurred in a state with enormous
advantages that include, to start, the <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts
Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Harvard Business School</ORGANIZATION>, big
banks, some of the nation's leading medical institutions,
scores of high-tech entrepreneurs and hundreds of thousands
of (over)educated workers.
   This year's veteran governor is <PERSON>Mr. Clinton</PERSON>, who, like <PERSON>Mr.
Dukakis</PERSON>, came back to dominate his state's politics after
voters rebelled against his first term. But the
accomplishments of <PERSON>Mr. Clinton</PERSON>, who has been cited as an
example by such Republicans as former Gov. <PERSON>Thomas Kean</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New
Jersey</LOCATION> and Gov. <PERSON>Carroll Campbell</PERSON> of <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>, are more
enduring.
   He's pressed for rural development and battled to win an
education overhaul that will be paying dividends to <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>
long after the public-private partnerships of <PERSON>Mr. Dukakis</PERSON>
have vanished. All of this in a state -- poor, crippled by
decades of segregation -- whose constitution shackles the
governor. Besides, <PERSON>Mr. Clinton</PERSON>, who actually likes
campaigning, is a far more natural politician than <PERSON>Mr.
Dukakis</PERSON>.
   -- The warrior lawmaker. The last <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veteran to seek
the presidency was <PERSON>Al Gore</PERSON>, who had been in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> only
briefly before he entered the race. Serious and sober, he
mastered esoteric arguments about the dangers of
chlorofluorocarbons and the potential of fiber-optic
networks. He talked tough and sensibly on defense and came
close to breaking through.
   His analogue this time is <PERSON>Sen. Kerrey</PERSON>, whose <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>
experience is PT-109 without the hype, and more stirring than
<PERSON>Mr. Gore</PERSON>'s experience as a reporter for the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>. He walked
on an artificial leg to pick up his Congressional Medal of
Honor, and is the first such honoree to sit in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>
since the Civil War veterans faded from politics. He matches
<PERSON>Mr. Gore</PERSON>'s experience in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> with a term as governor of
<LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, leaving office in a devoutly Republican state with
a <PERCENT>78%</PERCENT> approval rating. He has the star quality the somewhat
stodgy <PERSON>Mr. Gore</PERSON> lacks; at a fund-raiser for his <DATE>1988</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>
race, as many Nebraskans sought his autograph as <PERSON>Willie
Nelson</PERSON>'s.
   -- The fiery populist. Rep. <PERSON>Gephardt</PERSON> swept the <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>
caucuses four years ago with a populist theme that skirted
the very edge of protectionism, ending his speeches with an
explosive cry: "It's your fight, too." But that populism was
grafted onto <PERSON>Mr. Gephardt</PERSON>, who had built a reputation in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> as an insider with an eye toward accommodation.
   <PERSON>Sen. Harkin</PERSON> was born to poverty -- and populism.
Throughout his career he's relished the struggle against the
established and powerful. Unlike <PERSON>Mr. Gephardt</PERSON>, who has
strolled to re-election, <PERSON>Mr. Harkin</PERSON> has had real battles.
   --  The lonely man of ideas. <PERSON>Bruce Babbitt</PERSON> attracted a top
staff and a cult following in <DATE>1988</DATE> with some unusual
proposals: eliminate subsidies to large farmers, distribute
national child-care vouchers, curb tax breaks for executives'
bonuses.
   This time the idea man is <PERSON>Mr. Tsongas</PERSON>. While <PERSON>Mr. Babbitt</PERSON>
came to politics reluctantly, <PERSON>Mr. Tsongas</PERSON> grew up with it,
serving in local posts and the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> before becoming a force
in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, leaving only when faced with cancer. He
already is getting nods of agreement (though precious few
expressions of support) with a platform that offers an
"aggressively" pro-business approach, an end to requirements
that companies issue quarterly reports, a virgin materials
fee to give recycled commodities a price advantage, and an
<ORGANIZATION>Enterprise Corps</ORGANIZATION> of adults, modeled on the <ORGANIZATION>Peace Corps</ORGANIZATION>, to
help the Soviets.
   -- The voice of the voiceless. The last two campaigns, the
Rev. <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON> proved to be more than an eloquent voice
for the poor and disenfranchised. He emerged as a shrewd
strategist who knows how to set and then dominate the
political debate with rhetorical and moral fervor.
   But Gov. <PERSON>Wilder</PERSON> has done more than just talk about a
rainbow coalition. He's put one together, and done so in
<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, winning more than <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> of the white vote in a state
that a generation ago sought to revive the philosophy of <PERSON>John
C. Calhoun</PERSON> in a last-ditch effort of "massive resistance" to
desegregation. And while <PERSON>Mr. Jackson</PERSON> is often criticized for
supporting big-spending items, <PERSON>Mr. Wilder</PERSON> has positioned
himself as something of a fiscal conservative.
   Not that it will be easy to topple <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> next <DATE>November</DATE>.
The president's poll ratings are stratospheric and he's sure
to reignite the glow of the lightning victory in the <LOCATION>Persian
Gulf</LOCATION>. But there are vulnerable spots: the economy, the
continued rule of <PERSON>Saddam Hussein</PERSON>, a vague sense of unease
among the voters that things aren't quite right.
   But campaigns aren't always full of heavyweights. Few
political insiders considered <PERSON>Sen. John Kennedy</PERSON> anything but
a lightweight in <DATE>1959</DATE>, and only later did <PERSON>Hubert Humphrey</PERSON>
attain his solid reputation. In <DATE>1975</DATE>, the field of <PERSON>Jimmy
Carter</PERSON>, <PERSON>George Wallace</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mo Udall</PERSON>, <PERSON>Henry Jackson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Fred Harris</PERSON>
and <PERSON>Sargent Shriver</PERSON> wasn't noticeably stronger than this
group.
   And though this may not be the Democrats' starting five,
it is no old-timer's game either. Even with a 60-year-old
like <PERSON>Mr. Wilder</PERSON> in the group, it's a new generation of
candidates.
   Those strangers on the television set may be more suited
for the times than the familiar faces they're replacing.

The <ORGANIZATION>Big East Conference</ORGANIZATION> tournament begins tonight at <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Madison Square 
Garden</ORGANIZATION> with the elimination game between eighth-seeded <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> (11-16) and 
ninth-seeded <ORGANIZATION>Boston College</ORGANIZATION> (8-19), which scored only one conference victory 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
The winner advances to <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s quarterfinal round and an appointment with No. 
1-seeded Syracuse (22-5), the nation's fourth-ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
Also scheduled for <DATE>Friday</DATE>: <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> (25-5), ranked eighth, vs. <PERSON>Seton Hall</PERSON> 
(12-15), which nearly won a national championship last season; <PERSON>Georgetown</PERSON> 
(22-5), ranked fifth, vs. <LOCATION>Providence</LOCATION> (17-10), and St. John's (23-8) vs. 
Villanova (17-13). 
</P>
<P>
The championship game will be played <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
This tournament is usually a plaything for <ORGANIZATION>Syracuse</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Georgetown</ORGANIZATION>. The 
Orangemen or Hoyas have won eight of the 10 postseason titles (<ORGANIZATION>Syracuse</ORGANIZATION> two, 
<LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION> six) and only one championship game was played without either team 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to pick a favorite, <ORGANIZATION>Connecticut Coach Jim Calhoun</ORGANIZATION> chose <LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I would think right now, the team that has been most devastating to us is 
<LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION>," he said. "<LOCATION>Syracuse</LOCATION>, when they crank it up, is strong. We're 
third." 
</P>
<P>
Just to be safe, <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> also didn't rule out <LOCATION>Providence</LOCATION>, because of a lineup 
that includes five seniors who played on a Final Four team, and <ORGANIZATION>St. John</ORGANIZATION>'s, 
because of guard <LOCATION>Boo Harvey</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The point, he said, is that the <LOCATION>Big East</LOCATION> lends itself to upsets. Underrated 
<PERSON>Seton Hall</PERSON> was a last-second shot away from winning a national championship 
last year. This season, who knows? 
</P>
<P>

<HEAD>Haying Allowed In Set-Aside Land Because Of Drought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION> has opened up land
set aside under a massive federal conservation program so that
farmers may harvest hay in areas were livestock feed has been
shriveled by drought and hot weather.
   Agriculture Secretary <PERSON>Richard E. Lyng</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that all of
<LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION> and parts of a dozen other drought-stricken states are
eligible for haying on land held by farmers in the <ORGANIZATION>Conservation
Reserve Program</ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION>CRP</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Haying will be allowed for a 30-day period in counties found
to be suffering from a severe drought that has adversely affected
forage crops,'' <PERSON>Lyng</PERSON> said. ``Livestock grazing of this acreage is
not authorized.''
   In addition to the counties approved for haying, <PERSON>Lyng</PERSON> said that
additional designations will be made county-by-county by the

<DATE>Thursday</DATE> can begin applying for the haying program as soon as
county offices receive operating procedures in the next day or so.
   <PERSON>Newcomb</PERSON> said he had no estimates of how many acres are eligible
for haying in the designated counties.
   The <ORGANIZATION>CRP</ORGANIZATION>, was authorized in the <DATE>1985</DATE> farm law to take up to 45
million acres of highly erodible land from crop production for 10
years. The land must be planted to protective grass or trees. In
return, farmers get annual rental payments from the government,
currently averaging <MONEY>$45</MONEY> to <MONEY>$50</MONEY> per acre a year.
   Farmers in feed-short drought areas have been seeking permission
to harvest hay from the <ORGANIZATION>CRP</ORGANIZATION> land and also to graze livestock on it.
Lyng, however, said grazing was not approved.
   Participants in the program who opt to cut hay from <ORGANIZATION>CRP</ORGANIZATION> land
will have their next annual payments reduced <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> on the
acreage harvested.
   Emergency haying and grazing had already been approved in more
than 1,000 counties in 20 states for land taken from crop
production under annual commodity programs. That land involves
so-called ``acreage conservation reserve'' and ``conservation use''
land and is not included in the long-term <ORGANIZATION>CRP</ORGANIZATION> operation.
   According to <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION>'s announcement, further county eligibility for
haying priviliges on <ORGANIZATION>CRP</ORGANIZATION> land ``will be made based on the fact that
the country has been approved for the emergency haying and
grazing'' of land in the acreage conservation reserve and the
conservation use categories.
   Further, the agency said, a ``drought severity index'' reported
weekly by <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department's National Oceanic</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Atmospheric Administration</ORGANIZATION> will be use to determine a county's
haying eligibility.
   In addition to all of <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>'s 53 counties, the following

   Feeling a little alienated?
   Ever find yourself late at night wondering Just What Has Gone
Wrong With the Republic? Is the social contract up for renewal in
your neighborhood?
   And if <PERSON>Andrew Dice Clay</PERSON> did not exist, would it be necessary to
invent him?
   For the answer to the last question and more, tune in tonight to
<ORGANIZATION>PBS</ORGANIZATION> and ``Edge,'' a funny, adult and extremely well-written look at
American pop culture. It will show you things you otherwise
probably would never see.
   Vanity Fair writer <PERSON>James Wolcott</PERSON> tries to understand why people
laugh at the abusive humor of the '90s in the persona of <ORGANIZATION>Andrew
Dice Clay</ORGANIZATION>.
   Significantly, the segment is titled ``Another Day in Hell.''
   This is definitely for adults only. Not only does ``Edge''
liberally excerpt Clay's raunchy, unexpurgated concert routine, but
it discusses his appeal in terms of ``class hatred'' and
``marginalized'' white, working-class males.
   ``What's impressive about Clay is the emancipatory and
truth-telling impulse in him.'' says <PERSON>Frederic Smoler</PERSON>, a professor
of intellectual history at <ORGANIZATION>Sarah Lawrence College</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The grimmest and saddest and thing about Clay is when he
strips away a thing, debunks it, what's left to his audiences' view
and his own is pretty small and ugly.''
   The least accessible segment is about the faceless photographs
of <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> conceptual artist <PERSON>Lorna Simpson</PERSON>. It's followed by
a nice ballad (inexplicably sung on a bare city rooftop) by
singer-songwriter <PERSON>John Hiatt</PERSON>.
   The great humorist <ORGANIZATION>Buck Henry</ORGANIZATION> comes on next with a visit to the
<ORGANIZATION>Nixon Library</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Yorba Linda</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. In opening his essay on the
fall and rise of the elder statesman, <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> notes that <PERSON>Yorba Linda</PERSON>
means ``beautiful yorba.''
   There is commentary by Professor <PERSON>Stanley Cutler</PERSON>, author of ``The
Wars of Watergate,'' who notes that the <ORGANIZATION>Nixon Library</ORGANIZATION> makes no
mention of <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON>'s accepting a pardon for any Watergate crimes he
may have committed.
   ``Someday he'll be left alone to history,'' <PERSON>Cutler</PERSON> notes. He is
smiling.
   Henry notes <PERSON>Tom Brokaw</PERSON>'s visit to Yorba <PERSON>Linda</PERSON>, to anchor the
<TIME>evening</TIME> news from the museum. And the <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> birthplace, a kit-built
house that cost <MONEY>$800</MONEY> from the factory and <MONEY>$400,000</MONEY> to restore.
   There's such a nice, suppressed note of hysteria and loathing to
the piece. Far too soon, <ORGANIZATION>Henry</ORGANIZATION> bids a fond farewell to the <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON>
complex. He waves goodbye and drives away renewed, refreshed.
   The host of the series, Emmy Award winner <PERSON>Robert Krulwich</PERSON>,
reviews the recent history of student works at the <ORGANIZATION>Art Institute of
Chicago</ORGANIZATION>.
   Remember when one student painted Mayor <PERSON>Harold Washington</PERSON> in
brassiere, underpants, garter belt and stockings? The painting got
arrested.
   One year later, student ``Dread'' <PERSON>Scott Tyler</PERSON>'s wretched ``How
to Display the Flag'' ignited the furor of veterans and flag-wavers
by displaying a flag on the floor that tacitly invited spectators
to walk on it.
   The beleaguered head of the institute school, <PERSON>Tony Jones</PERSON>, notes
that people who tired of abstract art and called for the return to
figurative art have gotten their wish _ with a vengeance.
   Then the show shows us four performance artists whose
applications for federal grants were rejected. It's a delightful
irony.
   And, with a wonderfully wry finale, the excellent comedian,
actor, writer and ``Simpsons'' voice <PERSON>Harry Shearer</PERSON> explains to us
just WHY anchormen are girdling the globe to cover the story.
Shearer is magnificently low-key.
   Make time to see this pilot episode, a joint production of <LOCATION>New
York City</LOCATION>'s WNET and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s BBC-2. ``If successful, the pilot
will be followed by 10 one-hour programs,'' says <ORGANIZATION>WNET</ORGANIZATION>.
   Do yourself a favor and tune in.

   In "Some Summer Thoughts About Secession" (Global View,
op-ed, July 8), George Melloan very properly rejected any
analogy between the attempt of the Southern slave states to
secede from the American Union in 1861 and the current
attempts at secession from the Soviet Union and from
Yugoslavia. Mr. Melloan is entirely correct in asking,
"Should Americans allow Communists to say that seceding to
escape slavery is the same as seceding to preserve it?"
   While the underlying cause of secession was slavery, the
Southern argument was based upon what were called states'
rights. Each state, it was said, was sovereign, and possessed
the same constitutional right to withdraw from the Union that
it had originally to join it. Between 1787 and 1861 the
conception of states' rights -- in the South, but not only in
the South -- had, however, undergone a strange sea change. In
1787, as in 1776, all rights of the legitimate governments
were held to be grounded in the equal natural rights with
which every human individual had been endowed by his Creator.
States' rights -- or states' sovereignty, according to John
C. Calhoun, the spiritual father of the Confederacy -- had no
basis in natural law, but were entirely and exclusively
rights of positive law.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It was this severing of states' rights from natural rights
as much as the interest in slavery itself that drove the
movement for secession in <DATE>1861</DATE>. But the divorce of states'
rights from natural rights not only removes any moral basis
for condemning slavery but places all constitutional rights
of individuals of every race or color at the mercy of the
state. It was not for nothing that the late <PERSON>Richard
Hofstadter</PERSON> called <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> "the Marx of the master class."

<PERSON>Jim Calhoun</PERSON>, his <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> accent as thick as a bowl of clam chowder, never 
tires of telling how his <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> team defied logic and preseason 
predictions this year, to say nothing of a Big East schedule that includes such 
perennial basketball bullies as <ORGANIZATION>Syracuse</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Calhoun wants <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> to know that it didn't happen by accident, but by 
something as fickle and corny as teamwork. And OK, a little luck. 
</P>
<P>
It happened because <PERSON>Tate George</PERSON>, the only senior starter on the team, decided 
he wasn't going to go his entire career at <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> without appearing in at 
least one <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> tournament. So during the off-season he shot 500 jumpers a day 
and later helped organize thrice-weekly workouts with his teammates that began 
at <TIME>6:30 a.m.</TIME> 
</P>
<P>
It happened because sophomore <PERSON>Chris Smith</PERSON>, the one legitimate star on this 
team, nearly doubled his scoring average of a season ago. 
</P>
<P>
And it happened because <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON>, who may have done the best coaching job of his 
career, also knew a thing or two about international relations, convincing 
<LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>'s basketball treasure, <PERSON>Nadav Henefeld</PERSON>, to venture from the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> 
to the <LOCATION>Big East</LOCATION> and, of course, to the campus at <LOCATION>Storrs</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're Cinderella," <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> said. "I think we maximize what we do 
well and hide what we don't. We have good components. The pieces fit together. 
We seem to have some answers to problems presented on the court." 
</P>
<P>
Or cawt, as <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> pronounces it. 
</P>
<P>
"Bet you couldn't tell I'm from <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Picked by conference coaches to finish eighth, <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> ended the regular 
season tied for first place with <LOCATION>Syracuse</LOCATION>, which probably still can't believe 
it has to share a <LOCATION>Big East</LOCATION> title with the Huskies. And when play begins 
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> in the conference tournament at <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Madison Square Garden</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> will be there sporting all sorts of impressive numbers, including a 
25-5 record, an 11-4 Big East mark, a No. 8 national ranking and the 
testimonial of one <PERSON>John Thompson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Georgetown</ORGANIZATION> coach and closet sentimentalist. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the <ORGANIZATION>Hoyas</ORGANIZATION>' game against <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Capital Centre</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Landover</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> lumbered toward <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON>. In a brief, heartfelt 
exchange, <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> told the <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> coach how much he had admired the work 
done with the Huskies this season. Then, despite beating <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> by 20 
points that evening, <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> delivered a postgame sermon to the media that 
once again praised <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> and the Huskies.

"I think his team, in all the years I've been in the <LOCATION>Big East</LOCATION>, is the biggest 
surprise to me," <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> said. "People like to run around and talk about 
surprises, but I think <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> has done as good a job as I've ever seen in the 
<LOCATION>Big East</LOCATION> -- consistently at the level he's done it at. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, everybody talked about <PERSON>Seton Hall</PERSON> being a surprise (advancing to 
the final of the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> tournament). I thought <PERSON>Seton Hall</PERSON> was going to be a very 
good team, and everybody misread them. I did not think <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> would be as 
good as they are this year. The man has done one hell of a job with that team, 
regardless of what happens from here on in." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson spoke the truth. No team in the 11-year history of the <LOCATION>Big East</LOCATION> has 
been picked eighth in the preseason poll and finished first. No team in the 
conference ever finished seventh one season, as the Huskies did in <DATE>1988-89</DATE>, and 
went on to win or share a title the next season. In fact, no seventh-place <LOCATION>Big 
East</LOCATION> team had ever done better than fifth the following season until 
<LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> arrived and changed the shape of the bell curve. 
</P>
<P>
If <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> is upset about the preseason snub by his peers, he doesn't show it. 
If anything, he agreed with their choices. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were picked eighth because seventh and ninth were occupied," he 
said. "It was probably a very justifiable pick." 
</P>
<P>
Consider the reasons: <PERSON>Cliff Robinson</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Huskies</ORGANIZATION>' 6-foot-11 scoring machine, 
had joined the <ORGANIZATION>NBA</ORGANIZATION>. Connecticut's leading three-point shooter was gone, too. 
Worse yet, the returning team featured no double-figure scorer and only one 
senior starter. 
</P>
<P>
"But we had a lot of guys coming back, too," <PERSON>George</PERSON> said. "People don't know 
how hard you work during the <DATE>summer</DATE>. They just see how you ended the season." 
</P>
<P>
For <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, last season ended in the <ORGANIZATION>NIT</ORGANIZATION>, rather than in the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> 
tournament. An earlier two-point loss to <LOCATION>Providence</LOCATION> and a three-point loss to 
<PERSON>Seton Hall</PERSON> had sealed the <ORGANIZATION>Huskies</ORGANIZATION>' fate with the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> selection committee. 
Providence was the final Big East entry, thus extending <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>'s record as 
being the only team in the conference's history never to appear in the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
It was shortly after this <DATE>18-13</DATE> disappointment that <PERSON>George</PERSON> started pumping 500 
shots a day. Smith went to the Olympic Festival in <LOCATION>Oklahoma City</LOCATION> to improve his 
game. And <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> flew to <LOCATION>Tel Aviv</LOCATION>, in hopes of signing the 6-7 1/2 <ORGANIZATION>Henefeld</ORGANIZATION>, a 
low-post player on the Israeli national team whose soft touch and court skills 
were more suited to off-guard or small forward in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Henefeld</PERSON>, who had visited the <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> campus for only four hours during a 
previous recruiting trip, eventually accepted a scholarship from the Huskies. 
But he couldn't practice with the team until his Scholastic Aptitude Test 
results were received and approved by the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Henefeld took the test on <DATE>Oct. 14</DATE>. Connecticut began practice on <DATE>Oct. 15</DATE>. At 
<TIME>3:30 p.m.</TIME> on <DATE>Nov. 1</DATE>, <PERSON>Henefeld</PERSON> was granted permission to join the team. <TIME>Later 
that night</TIME>, after a brief orientation drill, <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> inserted <PERSON>Henefeld</PERSON> into the 
lineup against <ORGANIZATION>Marathon Oil</ORGANIZATION>, a traveling exhibition team. Afterward, <PERSON>Henefeld</PERSON> 
was asked about the experience. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very interesting, to play before you practice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Henefeld improved. He finished this season averaging 12.0 points and 5.9 
rebounds a game. He also recorded 120 steals, a total surpassed by only one 
other Division I player this season. Thus the nickname: "Gaza Strips." His 
teammates, though, unsure how to pronounce his first name (it's NAH-dove), 
started calling him, "the Dove." It stuck. 
</P>
<P>
Now there are a half-dozen interview requests for <ORGANIZATION>Henefeld</ORGANIZATION> each day -- and not 
just from the American media. As perhaps <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>'s leading sports celebrity, 
<ORGANIZATION>Henefeld</ORGANIZATION> is being followed closely in that country. That would explain why at 
least one Israeli television crew will be on press row when <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> plays 
<PERSON>Seton Hall</PERSON> <DATE>Friday</DATE> at noon in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, the Huskies are used to attention, however far-flung it might be. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-nine newspaper, radio and television reporters followed <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> to 
<ORGANIZATION>Boston College</ORGANIZATION> last week. Against Georgetown, four local stations reported live 
from the game. Ten newspapers accompanied the Huskies to the <ORGANIZATION>Great Alaska 
Shootout</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
It's no wonder <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> officials fondly refer to the area media as "The 
Horde." 
</P>
<P>
"People in other parts of the country might not comprehend that," said <PERSON>Tim 
Tolokan</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>'s sports information director. "But we're the No. 1 sports 
story in this state." 
</P>
<P>
Some story. The Huskies began their Big East schedule by losing their first two 
games. Then they proceeded to win 12 of their next 14 conference games. By 
season's end, <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> had beaten every <LOCATION>Big East</LOCATION> team at least once, 
including <ORGANIZATION>St. John</ORGANIZATION>'s, which had drubbed the Huskies by 31 points earlier in the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"When we lost to <ORGANIZATION>St. John</ORGANIZATION>'s as bad as we did, a lot of teams would have had a 
couple days off, figuring they needed time to forget about it," <PERSON>George</PERSON> said. 
"We had our regular 2 1/2-hour practice. It was like we didn't even play the 
night before." 
</P>
<P>
Said <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON>: "We have a tremendous sense of chemistry and we're unaffected by 
outside pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so, but they're also eighth in the conference in field-goal percentage, 
seventh in free-throw percentage, seventh in three-point percentage and sixth 
in rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
And this is the No. 8 team in the country? 
</P>
<P>
Connecticut survives despite such numbers because it averages about 17 more 
scoring opportunities a game than its opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"And you know the saying," <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> said, " 'Even a blind squirrel can find an 
acorn once in a while.' " 
</P>
<P>
Already there are rumors that <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> might be wooed away by a high-profile 
program in need of a good coach and some integrity -- did someone say <ORGANIZATION>North 
Carolina State</ORGANIZATION>? This is <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON>'s fourth year at <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> and he has taken 
the Huskies from a 9-19 record in <DATE>1986-87</DATE>, the year he had to start a walk-on 
from the baseball team, to an <ORGANIZATION>NIT</ORGANIZATION> championship the next season, to a 25-5 
record and a soon-to-be-issued <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> tournament bid in <DATE>1990</DATE>. And at <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s 
news conference in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> is expected to receive the <LOCATION>Big East</LOCATION>'s 
coach-of-the-year award. 
</P>
<P>
But will he stay put? 
</P>
<P>
So popular is <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> that he said he can't visit a restaurant 
and eat a meal without interruption from well-meaning fans. He has become a 
state hero, and with such stature comes a price, mainly his privacy. 
</P>
<P>
"Every single year, what I try to do is sit down and evaluate myself and my 
situation," he said. "<LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> is a terrific job. I'm not sure the vision 
was 25-5, though. The vision was to make us a mainstream Big East team." 
</P>
<P>
That accomplished, <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> carefully fends off talk of his possible departure. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy here," he said. "I don't have plans to leave here. But I want to 
make sure I feel very comfortable here." 
</P>
<P>
A <ORGANIZATION>Big East</ORGANIZATION> tournament championship would help. So would a strong showing in the 
<ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> tournament, which is what <PERSON>George</PERSON> has in mind. After all, he didn't shoot 
those off-season jumpers for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"Inside the league, they respect us because we come out every night and play 
hard," <PERSON>George</PERSON> said. "But outside the league, people think we're still the new 
team on the block. Hopefully, we'll raise some hell in the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
As if they haven't done enough already.

<HEAD>Love-Triangle Murder, Grant's Menagerie: Lafayette Square Saw it
All</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tourists admiring the grassy serenity of
<LOCATION>Lafayette Square</LOCATION> little suspect that it once was the site of a
love-triangle murder, <PERSON>Helen Hayes</PERSON>' stage debut and a makeshift zoo
where <PERSON>Ulysses S. Grant</PERSON> kept a menagerie of deer and prairie dogs.
   Some of the ``secrets of <LOCATION>Lafayette Square</LOCATION>,'' both amusing and
tragic, were disclosed <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> during a historical tour of the
seven-acre park opposite the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>. The tour was sponsored by
the <ORGANIZATION>National Trust for Historic Preservation</ORGANIZATION>.
   According to tour guide <PERSON>Sarah Shaffer</PERSON>, the square that is
inhabited today by homeless vagrants and anti-nuclear demonstrators
once was surrounded by elegant hotels and clubs and the homes of
prominent <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> figures.
   The square is no stranger to scandal. More than a century before
the Watergate scandal engulfed the <ORGANIZATION>Nixon White House</ORGANIZATION>, a lurid sex
scandal resulted in the death of the son of <PERSON>Francis Scott Key</PERSON>, who
wrote ``The Star-Spangled Banner.''
   <PERSON>Phillip Barton</PERSON> Key was fond of crossing the square from his
boarding house to visit the wife of <PERSON>Daniel Sickles</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>
congressman, when she waved an all-clear signal from her bedroom
window. Sickles, enraged at the discovery of his wife's infidelity,
killed Key with a shotgun blast in <DATE>1859</DATE>.
   On the east side of the square lived <PERSON>Dolley Madison</PERSON>, the
destitute widow of <PERSON>James Madison</PERSON>, who had to mortgage her house
before <PERSON>Henry Clay</PERSON> persuaded <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to give her <MONEY>$20,000</MONEY> to pay off
her debt to <PERSON>John Jacob Astor</PERSON>.
   Nearby is the site of the old <ORGANIZATION>Belasco Theater</ORGANIZATION>, a vaudeville
palace where actress <PERSON>Helen Hayes</PERSON> made her first stage appearance as
a 5-year-old singer.
   On the northeastern edge of the square, where the <ORGANIZATION>Department of
Veterans Affairs</ORGANIZATION> has its headquarters, stood the posh <LOCATION>Arlington
Hotel</LOCATION>, where industrialist <PERSON>Andrew Carnegie</PERSON> once spent <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> on a
dinner party for his friends.
   The park originally contained a private farmhouse, apple orchard
and graveyard before it was bought in <DATE>1791</DATE> to help create the
capital city envisioned by <PERSON>George</PERSON> <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   It served as the unkempt front lawn of the executive mansion for
a while, until <PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON> ordered <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> Avenue built
right through the middle. It was a military campground in the War
of <DATE>1812</DATE> and again during the Civil War, when President Lincoln
crossed the street to visit troops guarding the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>.
   The President's Park was renamed <LOCATION>Lafayette Square</LOCATION> during the
French military hero's visit to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in <DATE>1824</DATE>. But it
is <PERSON>Andrew Jackson</PERSON> _ not <LOCATION>Lafayette</LOCATION> _ who is honored with an
equestrian statue in the center of the park.
   The statue was cast at a local foundry from melted-down British
cannons seized in the War of <DATE>1812</DATE>. It was unveiled in <DATE>1853</DATE> and
celebrated by spectators who toasted ``Old Hickory'' from open kegs
of rum and whiskey.
   The square was haunted by tragedy, too.
   Conspirators in <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION>'s assassination in <DATE>1865</DATE> bungled an
attempt to kill Secretary of State <PERSON>William Seward</PERSON> in his home on
<LOCATION>Lafayette Square</LOCATION>. Although <PERSON>Seward</PERSON> survived, his wife and daughter
died of ``nervous prostration'' shortly after the attack.
   In a home on the present site of the Hay-Adams Hotel on the
northern edge of the square, <PERSON>Clover Adams</PERSON>, daughter-in-law of <PERSON>John
Quincy Adams</PERSON>, committed suicide by drinking chemicals from her
rooftop photography lab.
   Long before the square was beautified with fountains and floral
gardens, President Grant had the park drained and landscaped,
removed a Civil War cemetery and installed his pet deer and prairie
dogs.
   Grant's zoo was closed when the neighbors complained of the
noise and stench.
   The tour was part of local observances of <ORGANIZATION>National Historic
Preservation Week</ORGANIZATION>, an annual event sponsored by the non-profit
<ORGANIZATION>National Trust</ORGANIZATION> to encourage public support of efforts to preserve
buildings, objects and sites of historic significance.

<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> class
of <DATE>1940</DATE>, couldn't resist some good-natured teasing when <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION>
awarded him an honorary doctorate in <DATE>1962</DATE>.
   ``As <ORGANIZATION>General de Gaulle</ORGANIZATION> occasionally acknowledged <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> to be
the daughter of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, so I am pleased to come to <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION>, the
daughter of <LOCATION>Harvard</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON> told graduates assembled in the
courtyard of <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION>'s Old Campus on that sunny <DATE>June day</DATE>.
   ``It might be said now that I have the best of both worlds _ a
<ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> education and a <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> degree,'' <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON> said.
   This year's presidential campaign has elevated what is perhaps
the oldest, most intense and most snobbish rivalry in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> to a
new height.
   For the spoils of this contest will go either to a Yale man or a
<ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> man _ only the second time in 200 years that graduates of
the two schools have vied for the presidency of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   And the only other time it happened, in <DATE>1912</DATE>, the <LOCATION>Harvard</LOCATION> man,
<PERSON>Theodore Roosevelt</PERSON>, and the <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> man, <PERSON>William Howard Taft</PERSON>, both
lost to a <LOCATION>Princeton</LOCATION> man, <PERSON>Woodrow Wilson</PERSON>.
   While <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON> was a master at exploiting his <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> education
for political advantage, Republican <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> class of
<DATE>1948</DATE>, has tried to turn Democrat <PERSON>Michael S. Dukakis</PERSON>' Harvard
connections into a campaign liability.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, scion of a wealthy <LOCATION>Greenwich</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, family, accuses the
<LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> governor, the son of Greek immigrants, of having a
``Harvard boutique'' mentality tainted by ``liberalism and
elitism.''
   Campaigning <DATE>Saturday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Modesto</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said, ``I don't
want somebody from <LOCATION>Harvard</LOCATION> telling me what I can do and what I
can't do.''
   Asked about that statement at a news conference <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>
said he did not want to take on the institution itself, asking
``How can I, a nice guy from <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION>, feel that way about Harvard? Now
come on.
   ``I'm talking about a handful of people that have served in
(recent) Democratic administrations that come out of the same
liberal philisophy. And they know who they are,'' he said.
``There's an elite inside the elite there.''
   Dukakis, in turn, has tried to stay out of the Harvard-Yale
debate, saying his <DATE>1960</DATE> Harvard law degree and teaching stint at
<ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy School of Government</ORGANIZATION> don't make him a <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> man
at all.
   ``I'm a Swarthmore guy,'' <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> says, referring to the liberal
arts college in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> where he received his undergraduate
degree.
   But <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s Harvard line held little sting given his own Ivy
League connections. And it probably was lost on most Americans, who
view both <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Harvard</LOCATION> as elite <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> universities for the
wealthy.
   Dukakis campaign aides couldn't hold their tongues when outgoing
Education Secretary <PERSON>William Bennett</PERSON>, himself a <ORGANIZATION>Harvard Law School</ORGANIZATION>
graduate, asserted on national television in <DATE>September</DATE> that the
<LOCATION>Harvard</LOCATION> crowd ``with which <PERSON>Mike Dukakis</PERSON> runs ... think they're
smarter'' than most Americans.
   ``<PERSON>Bill Bennett</PERSON> spent seven or eight years getting an education
in <LOCATION>Massachussetts</LOCATION> and these comments are a clear indication that it
didn't do him a bit of good,'' shot back <PERSON>Mark Gearan</PERSON>, press
secretary at <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>' <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> headquarters.
   Harvard and <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> have eyed each other with haughty disdain for
nearly 300 years, since <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> was founded in <DATE>1701</DATE> by a group of
clergy worried about religious backsliding at the more liberal
<ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION>, the oldest college in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. Harvard was founded in
<DATE>1636</DATE>, just 16 years after the Pilgrims landed at <LOCATION>Plymouth Rock</LOCATION>.
   ``We have been natural rivals almost from the beginning,''
<PERSON>George Pierson</PERSON>, the Larned professor emeritus of history at <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION>,
said recently. ``We were the only two with the exception of <LOCATION>William</LOCATION>
and <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> that you could go to. After that, we both grew in the
favor of the Lord.''
   The Harvard-Yale annual crew race is the oldest intercollegiate
sports rivalry in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, dating from <DATE>1852</DATE>. The schools refer to
their annual football contest as ``The Game,'' as if all others
hardly matter.
   Other Harvard-Yale presidential campaigns have been averted only
by quirks of history. The <DATE>1824</DATE> election would have pitted <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION>
graduate <PERSON>John Quincy Adams</PERSON> against <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> graduate <PERSON>John Calhoun</PERSON>, but
<PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> dropped out and threw his support to <PERSON>Adams</PERSON>, who defeated
<PERSON>Andrew Jackson</PERSON>, who didn't have a college degree.
   The <DATE>1876</DATE> contest between <PERSON>Rutherford B. Hayes</PERSON>, a graduate of
<ORGANIZATION>Harvard Law School</ORGANIZATION>, against <PERSON>Samuel Tilden</PERSON> would have been a
Harvard-Yale matchup, except <PERSON>Tilden</PERSON> dropped out of <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> after one
year and graduated from <ORGANIZATION>New York University</ORGANIZATION>.
   Although this is only the second head-to-head match, <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> both boast presidents among their graduates. While <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> holds
the edge in their football series, 56-40, and <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> holds the
edge in crew races, 72-51, <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> holds a substantial lead in the
presidential sweepstakes: six <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> graduates have held the
office _ <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON>, <PERSON>John Quincy Adams</PERSON>, <PERSON>Hayes</PERSON>, <PERSON>Theodore Roosevelt</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Franklin Roosevelt</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Kennedy</LOCATION> _ compared to just two from <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> _
Taft and <PERSON>Gerald Ford</PERSON>, a <DATE>1941</DATE> graduate of <ORGANIZATION>Yale Law School</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Raymond Wolfinger</PERSON>, a political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION>University of
California</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>, says most Americans don't give a hoot about
the Harvard-Yale rivalry.
   ``In terms of the mass public, the difference between <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION>
and <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> is nonsense,'' said <PERSON>Wolfinger</PERSON>, who earned his doctorate at
<ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Echoes of a Speakers' Scandal Followed Blaine for
Life</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the <TIME>morning</TIME> of <DATE>June 5, 1876</DATE>, <PERSON>James G.
Blaine</PERSON>, the speaker of the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION>, stood in the
well of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and waved a packet of letters in the air.
   Blaine, one of the nation's foremost politicians, was in serious
trouble.
   And he was about to confound his accusers.
   Nearly 113 years later another speaker of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> _ <PERSON>Jim Wright</PERSON>
of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> _ faces accusations of unethical behavior in office.
   Wright adamantly denies any wrongdoing. But he has been the
subject of the most prolonged and intense of the several
investigations conducted over the decades into the private and
public affairs of a speaker of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>.
   Speaker <PERSON>Blaine</PERSON> rode out his scandal, but echoes of it were to
follow him for the rest of his career.
   In the <DATE>spring of 1876</DATE>, <PERSON>Blaine</PERSON> was a frontrunner for the
Republican presidential nomination in the election that would
replace President <PERSON>Ulysses S. Grant</PERSON>'s corruption-ridden
administration.
   Three years earlier Reps. <PERSON>Oakes Ames</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Mass.</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>James Brooks</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>D-Mass.</LOCATION>, had been censured by the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> for involvement in the
so-called Credit Mobilier scandal in which railroad construction
stock had been given to selected members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, allegedly for
favors received.
   Now <PERSON>Blaine</PERSON> became embroiled in the scandal, facing accusations
that the <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific Railroad</ORGANIZATION> had paid the speaker an inflated
price for stock of a defunct and bankrupt rail line.
   An investigation was launched by the <ORGANIZATION>House Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION>
but it was sputtering when new evidence emerged.
   It took the form of a set of letters between <PERSON>Blaine</PERSON> and a
business partner which had come into the possession of a third man,
<PERSON>James Mulligan</PERSON>.
   Mulligan, in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> to testify before the committee,
encountered an unexpected visitor at his hotel _ Speaker <PERSON>James G.
Blaine</PERSON>.
   According to <LOCATION>Mulligan</LOCATION>, an emotional session followed in which
<PERSON>Blaine</PERSON> fell to his hands and knees and begged for the letters,
threatening suicide if he did not receive them.
   Mulligan claimed <PERSON>Blaine</PERSON> obtained the letters by a pretext and
left the hotel.
   An uproar followed and <PERSON>Blaine</PERSON> came under intense pressure to
make the <LOCATION>Mulligan</LOCATION> letters public. He refused, claiming they were
private property.
   Instead, he obtained a statement from two lawyers who said they
had examined the letters and found nothing relevant to the
investigation.
   The uproar continued and <PERSON>Blaine</PERSON> set about to defuse it.
   On <DATE>June 5</DATE> he appeared on the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> floor and waved the packet
exclaiming, ``There they are. ... There are the original letters.''
   Blaine then read aloud what he said were the contents of each of
the letters. He said he had handed over ``every solitary scrap and
scrimption'' for inclusion in the <ORGANIZATION>Congressional Record</ORGANIZATION>.
   They had, he declared, ``no more to do with that investigation
than the <LOCATION>North Pole</LOCATION>.''
   But no one was ever shown the originals of the letters to verify
<PERSON>Blaine</PERSON>'s reading of them.
   Events moved rapidly.
   Blaine collapsed outside his church suffering from a possible
heat stroke. The investigation was postponed for two weeks to await
his recovery. But before the committee could reconvene, the
governor of <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> appointed <PERSON>Blaine</PERSON> to fill a vacancy in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.
   The investigation was postponed again, and eventually died.
   Blaine's political backers proceeded, in classical <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>
fashion, to make the best of a bad situation.
   In the <DATE>20th century</DATE> it's called making lemonade out of a lemon.
   Blaine's name was placed in nomination at the <ORGANIZATION>Republican
National Convention</ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON>Robert G. Ingersoll</PERSON> on <DATE>June 15, 1876</DATE>, with
words that gave <PERSON>Blaine</PERSON> an enduring nickname: ``The plumed knight
from the state of <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>.''
   ``Like an armed warrior, like a plumed knight, <PERSON>James G. Blaine</PERSON>
marched down the halls of the <ORGANIZATION>American Congress</ORGANIZATION> and threw his
shining lance full and fair against the brazen forehead of every
traitor to his country and every maligner of his fair reputation.''
   Blaine never obtained the presidency.
   But he twice was appointed secretary of state.
   No <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> speaker has ever been ousted. But several have been
singed during the 200-year history of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.

<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   On the <TIME>morning</TIME> of <DATE>June 5, 1876</DATE>, <PERSON>James G.
Blaine</PERSON>, the speaker of the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION>, stood in the
well of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and waved a packet of letters in the air.
   Blaine, one of the nation's foremost politicians, was in serious
trouble.
   And he was about to confound his accusers.
   Nearly 113 years later another speaker of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> _ <PERSON>Jim Wright</PERSON>
of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> _ faces accusations of unethical behavior in office.
   Wright adamantly denies any wrongdoing. But he has been the
subject of the most prolonged and intense of the several
investigations conducted over the decades into the private and
public affairs of a speaker of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>.
   Speaker <PERSON>Blaine</PERSON> rode out his scandal, but echoes of it were to
follow him for the rest of his career.
   In the <DATE>spring of 1876</DATE>, <PERSON>Blaine</PERSON> was a frontrunner for the
Republican presidential nomination in the election that would
replace President <PERSON>Ulysses S. Grant</PERSON>'s corruption-ridden
administration.
   Three years earlier Reps. <PERSON>Oakes Ames</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Mass.</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>James Brooks</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>D-Mass.</LOCATION>, had been censured by the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> for involvement in the
so-called Credit Mobilier scandal in which railroad construction
stock had been given to selected members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, allegedly for
favors received.
   Now <PERSON>Blaine</PERSON> became embroiled in the scandal, facing accusations
that the <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific Railroad</ORGANIZATION> had paid the speaker an inflated
price for stock of a defunct and bankrupt rail line.
   An investigation was launched by the <ORGANIZATION>House Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION>
but it was sputtering when new evidence emerged.
   It took the form of a set of letters between <PERSON>Blaine</PERSON> and a
business partner which had come into the possession of a third man,
<PERSON>James Mulligan</PERSON>.
   Mulligan, in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> to testify before the committee,
encountered an unexpected visitor at his hotel _ Speaker <PERSON>James G.
Blaine</PERSON>.
   According to <LOCATION>Mulligan</LOCATION>, an emotional session followed in which
<PERSON>Blaine</PERSON> fell to his hands and knees and begged for the letters,
threatening suicide if he did not receive them.
   Mulligan claimed <PERSON>Blaine</PERSON> obtained the letters by a pretext and
left the hotel.
   An uproar followed and <PERSON>Blaine</PERSON> came under intense pressure to
make the <LOCATION>Mulligan</LOCATION> letters public. He refused, claiming they were
private property.
   Instead, he obtained a statement from two lawyers who said they
had examined the letters and found nothing relevant to the
investigation.
   The uproar continued and <PERSON>Blaine</PERSON> set about to defuse it.
   On <DATE>June 5</DATE> he appeared on the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> floor and waved the packet
exclaiming, ``There they are. ... There are the original letters.''
   Blaine then read aloud what he said were the contents of each of
the letters. He said he had handed over ``every solitary scrap and
scrimption'' for inclusion in the <ORGANIZATION>Congressional Record</ORGANIZATION>.
   They had, he declared, ``no more to do with that investigation
than the <LOCATION>North Pole</LOCATION>.''
   But no one was ever shown the originals of the letters to verify
<PERSON>Blaine</PERSON>'s reading of them.
   Events moved rapidly.
   Blaine collapsed outside his church suffering from a possible
heat stroke. The investigation was postponed for two weeks to await
his recovery. But before the committee could reconvene, the
governor of <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> appointed <PERSON>Blaine</PERSON> to fill a vacancy in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.
   The investigation was postponed again, and eventually died.
   Blaine's political backers proceeded, in classical <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>
fashion, to make the best of a bad situation.
   In the <DATE>20th century</DATE> it's called making lemonade out of a lemon.
   Blaine's name was placed in nomination at the <ORGANIZATION>Republican
National Convention</ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON>Robert G. Ingersoll</PERSON> on <DATE>June 15, 1876</DATE>, with
words that gave <PERSON>Blaine</PERSON> an enduring nickname: ``The plumed knight
from the state of <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>.''
   ``Like an armed warrior, like a plumed knight, <PERSON>James G. Blaine</PERSON>
marched down the halls of the <ORGANIZATION>American Congress</ORGANIZATION> and threw his
shining lance full and fair against the brazen forehead of every
traitor to his country and every maligner of his fair reputation.''
   Blaine never obtained the presidency.
   But he twice was appointed secretary of state.
   No <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> speaker has ever been ousted. But several have been
singed during the 200-year history of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Henry Clay</PERSON>, who was elected speaker six times, drew accusations
of ``corrupt bargain'' when the close election of <DATE>1824</DATE> was thrown
into the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION>.
   The choice was between <PERSON>Andrew Jackson</PERSON> and <PERSON>John Quincy Adams</PERSON>.
Clay and other members of the <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> delegation tipped the
balance in favor of <ORGANIZATION>Adams</ORGANIZATION>.
   The accusations flew after the victorious <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> named Clay as
his secretary of state.
   Speaker <PERSON>Samuel J. Randall</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> Democrat, promptly
called for his own investigation in <DATE>1879</DATE> after being accused of
favoritism toward a company which provided the paper for the bonds
and banknotes produced by the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Engraving</ORGANIZATION>.
   He was quickly cleared.
   In <DATE>1910</DATE> Speaker <PERSON>Joseph G. Cannon</PERSON> faced a rebellion against his
imperious and heavy handed rule of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>.
   Although not deposed, Cannon was stripped of much of his power.
   Speaker <PERSON>Thomas P.</PERSON> ``Tip'' <PERSON>O'Neill</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Mass.</LOCATION>, was named in the
so-called ``Koreagate'' influence peddling scandal in the <DATE>1970</DATE>'s

   <PERSON>Gore Vidal</PERSON>'s novelistic march through <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> history here reaches the years 1895-1906 and the presidencies of <PERSON>William McKinley</PERSON> and <PERSON>Theodore Roosevelt</PERSON>. 
It wasn't our nation's finest hour and this novel isn't <PERSON>Mr. Vidal</PERSON>'s. 

   Perhaps the problem is that the novel lacks a towering central character. 
After reinventing <PERSON>Aaron Burr</PERSON> for an age that remembered him, if at all, only as one of history's bad guys, and humanizing <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON> who had been so wrapped in glory by <PERSON>Carl Sandburg</PERSON>'s interminable, adoring biography in earlier historical novels, <PERSON>Mr. Vidal</PERSON> is working with lesser figures here in his fifth fictional treatment of American history. 

   Geniuses come and go on the periphery -- <PERSON>Henry Adams</PERSON>, <PERSON>Brooks Adams</PERSON>, <PERSON>Henry James</PERSON> -- but the novel centers on a fictional woman, <PERSON>Caroline Sanford</PERSON>, who becomes a powerful <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> newspaper publisher, and <PERSON>John Hay</PERSON>, once secretary to <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION>, now secretary of state for <ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Roosevelt</LOCATION>. 

   In <DATE>Hay</DATE>, a wealthy, famous writer turned statesman, <PERSON>Mr. Vidal</PERSON>, a famous writer but only a would-be statesman, has a sort of mirror image of himself. 
And "Empire" (<ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION>, 486 pages, <MONEY>$22.50</MONEY>) is a forum for Vidalian jibes -- many of them delivered by Hay -- at the follies of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> politicians and the corruption of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> society. 
A major part of a secretary of state's job is defined as "to provide jobs that don't exist for the friends of senators who do." 
<PERSON>Caroline Sanford</PERSON>, rich, intelligent, French-educated and virginal, decides early on: "Sentimental religiosity and public stealing, that was the new world." 
Another character, disparaging <PERSON>Roosevelt</PERSON>, wonders: "Perhaps that was the politician's art: to bring to the obvious the appearance of novelty and passion." 

   When "Empire" begins, Hay is 60 years old and in failing health. 
<PERSON>Mr. Vidal</PERSON>, now 61, presents him as an autumnal voice seeking meaning in his own life and brooding upon mankind's follies. 
Early on Hay muses: "If I were to tell the truth I would have to confess that I have somehow managed to mislay my life. 
Through carelessness, I have lost track of time and now time is losing, rapidly, all track of me." 

   Hay also is the main voice for <PERSON>Mr. Vidal</PERSON>'s opposition to the creation of an American empire, the cherished goal of <LOCATION>Roosevelt</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Sen. Henry Cabot</PERSON> Lodge and others who glory in the taking of <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>. 
Jingoism rides high. 
"<LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> is ours," says Lodge. 
<PERSON>Brooks Adams</PERSON>, guru to <LOCATION>Roosevelt</LOCATION>, proclaims: "If the Anglo-Saxon race is to survive -- and prevail -- we must go to war." 

   It's a debate as familiar as <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> today or <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> 20 years ago. 
Equally fresh are some of the novel's discussions of sex and public life. 
Like <PERSON>Caroline Sanford</PERSON>, <PERSON>Gary Hart</PERSON> might ask whether "Americans really believe what they said {on sexual relations} or were . . . simply fearful of that ominous majority whose ignorance and energy set the national tone? 
They certainly never ceased to pretend in public that marriage was not only sacred but the stately terminus to romance." 

   But while <PERSON>Mr. Vidal</PERSON> makes much of his characters' thoughts and conversations, "Empire" is a curiously plotless book, almost totally lacking drama. 
Even in the fictional lives of <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> and her brother <PERSON>Blaise</PERSON> what might be a bitter or damaging contest over their inheritance ends up with their amicably sharing the family mansion in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and their <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> newspaper. 

   Adultery, a homosexual seduction, a potentially career-destroying unmarried pregnancy, some family skeletons dragged from the closet, all get thrown into the mix, but <PERSON>Mr. Vidal</PERSON> doesn't seem to care. 
At times he doesn't seem to care about what he's saying either. 
It's hard to believe that <PERSON>Mr. Vidal</PERSON>, the antithesis of sophomoric, could write, as he does after the tragic death of <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON>'s young fiance: "As <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> comforted her maid, <PERSON>Blaise</PERSON> knew that she would be all right. 
On the other hand, he wondered, briefly, about the universe. 
Was it all right? or was the whole thing meaningless and random, and insensately cruel?" 

   He has a better time making fun of the idle rich at <LOCATION>Newport</LOCATION>. 
Or mocking the press. 
Or playing with mirrors of fact and fiction as when his heroine, seeking advice from <PERSON>Henry Adams</PERSON>, likens herself to <PERSON>Mrs. Lightfoot Lee</PERSON>, the heroine of <ORGANIZATION>Adams</ORGANIZATION>'s wonderful <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> novel "Democracy." 

   But there's far too little of <PERSON>Mr. Vidal</PERSON> having such fun in "Empire." 
The way publishing operates, however, what's between the yellow covers of "Empire" doesn't matter. 
It's already an assured best seller, published with a giant first printing of 200,000 copies and as a Book-of-the-Month-Club main selection. 
And why not? 
After 21 novels, five plays, a book of short stories and five collections of essays in a distinguished 41-year career, when <PERSON>Mr. Vidal</PERSON> writes a novel it ought to be a center-ring event. 

   But is all history center-ring material? 
Is everything grist for the historical novelists' mills? 
At the rate those mills are grinding now, there will be a place in fiction for everyone from every administration. 
I wonder what future readers will make of <PERSON>Billy Carter</PERSON>. 
Or of <PERSON>Albert Hakim</PERSON>.

<TEXT>
<P>
Like most basketball players, Rod Sellers probably dreamed of being on the 
floor with a championship on the line. 
</P>
<P>
In Sellers' case, however, the dream has become a little twisted. 
</P>
<P>
Sellers, the <ORGANIZATION>University of Connecticut</ORGANIZATION>'s sophomore center, has wrenched his 
left knee three times in the past seven games. Each time, he has wound up on 
the floor, squirming with pain. 
</P>
<P>
He hit the deck again in UConn's second-round <ORGANIZATION>NCAA Tournament</ORGANIZATION> victory over <LOCATION>UC 
Berkeley</LOCATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. "It's getting frustrating, ending up on the floor every 
game," Sellers said. 
</P>
<P>
Although he didn't practice <DATE>Monday</DATE>, Sellers pronounced himself well enough to 
play against <ORGANIZATION>Clemson</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA East Regional</ORGANIZATION> semifinals at 
<ORGANIZATION>Brendan Byrne Arena</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>East Rutherford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J</LOCATION>. The winner of that game will face 
the winner of the UCLA-Duke game for a berth in the Final Four in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Sellers said he would practice today -- "All out," he said -- and is looking 
forward to tangling with <ORGANIZATION>Clemson</ORGANIZATION>'s 6-foot-11 front-court stars, <PERSON>Elden Campbell</PERSON> 
and <PERSON>Dale Davis</PERSON>, known as the "Duo of Doom." 
</P>
<P>
"No doubt I'm playing," said Sellers, who has a partial tear of the medial 
collateral ligament. "There was less pain this time. It's a little stiff and I 
can't bend it all the way back, but I can run (and move laterally). . . . It's 
nothing serious, it just needs some rest." 
</P>
<P>
UConn Coach <PERSON>Jim Calhoun</PERSON> said Sellers could have re-entered the game against <ORGANIZATION>UC 
Berkeley</ORGANIZATION>, which the Huskies won by 20 points, but it was not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"If it was this <DATE>Thursday</DATE> and the same thing happened, he probably would play," 
<PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
That suits Sellers fine. He is from <LOCATION>Florence</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, and grew up watching the 
Tigers on television. In fact, <ORGANIZATION>Clemson</ORGANIZATION> was high on Sellers' list when he was 
choosing a college. 
</P>
<P>
When Sellers visited <ORGANIZATION>Clemson, Campbell</ORGANIZATION> and 6-7 forward <PERSON>Sean Tyson</PERSON> showed him 
around. "I know those guys pretty well," Sellers said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis had 26 points and 17 of <ORGANIZATION>Clemson</ORGANIZATION>'s 55 rebounds in the Tigers' <DATE>79-75</DATE> 
victory over <LOCATION>LaSalle</LOCATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> at the Civic Center. Tyson had 17 points and 
11 rebounds and <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION>, who fouled out, had seven points and five rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"When they first put the (NCAA Tournament) brackets up I said, 'We're going to 
meet them sometime,' " Sellers said. 
</P>
<P>
Sellers, who averages 8.6 points and 5.3 rebounds, is wearing his third knee 
brace. He has used a white one and, for the sake of poetic justice, a black one 
and a blue one. He wants to get a darker blue brace to match his uniform. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had so many braces, I want to get one in every color," he said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Murray Williams</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>UConn</ORGANIZATION>'s junior forward, also will wear a knee brace <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, 
although it's not nearly as high-tech as Sellers'. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Williams</PERSON>, who has a history of knee problems, had fluid drained from his right 
knee <DATE>Monday</DATE> and should be ready for the <ORGANIZATION>Clemson</ORGANIZATION> game. "There's been more and

   L. <PERSON>Douglas Wilder</PERSON>'s apparent victory in the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> governor's
race is a watershed in American political history, in which black
politicians have had but a shadowy presence.
   Wilder would be the nation's first elected black governor, but
would not be the first black American to serve as governor.
   That distinction belongs to <PERSON>Pinckney Benton Stewart Pinchback</PERSON>,
who became governor of <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> following the impeachment of <ORGANIZATION>Henry
Clay Warmoth</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1872</DATE>. He served for 43 days until the newly elected
<PERSON>William Pitt Kellogg</PERSON> was sworn in.
   Although any number of candidates could have been drawn from the
small, black middle class that had existed in the nation since its
founding, a black was not elected to office until <DATE>1855</DATE>, when <PERSON>John
Mercer Langston</PERSON> was elected clerk of Brownhelm Township in <LOCATION>Lorain
County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>.
   The first blacks ever elected to a legislative body were <PERSON>Edward
G. Walker</PERSON>, son of abolitionist <PERSON>David Walker</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Charles L.
Mitchell</PERSON>, who won seats in the <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts House of
Representatives</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1866</DATE>.
   Most of the nation's first black elected officials won their
positions during Reconstruction _ the post-Civil War period in
which Southern states were reorganized so they could rejoin the
<ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION>. Blacks were allowed to vote for the first time and seek
elected office.
   It was a time when <PERSON>Robert H. Wood</PERSON> became mayor of <LOCATION>Natchez</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Miss.</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Joseph H. Rainey</PERSON> of <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> became the first
black in the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Hiram R. Revels</PERSON>, a minister, succeeded <PERSON>Jefferson Davis</PERSON> as <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
senator from <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> on <DATE>Feb. 25, 1870</DATE>, thus becoming first
black in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON>Blanche K. Bruce</PERSON>, also from <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, was
the first black to serve a full term in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.
   Pinchback, the son of a <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> planter and a black woman,
had been a captain in the <ORGANIZATION>Union Army</ORGANIZATION>. Following the Civil War, he
settled in <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> and joined the <ORGANIZATION>Republican Party</ORGANIZATION>, which largely
consisted of newly franchised blacks and sympathetic and liberal
whites.
   A shrewd and ambitious man, he was elected to the state <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>
in <DATE>1868</DATE> and was named president pro tempore. When <PERSON>Oscar J. Dunn</PERSON>, a
former slave and the nation's first black lieutenant governor,
died, Pinchback moved to the No. 2 spot through constitutional
succession.
   There were other black lieutenant governors during
Reconstruction in <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>. But none was ever
elected governor.
   Wilder, too, served as a lieutenant governor in a Southern
state. But in <LOCATION>Virigina</LOCATION> at the <DATE>end of the 20th century</DATE>, he is part
of the political mainstream.
   Pinchback was something of a pariah. Even as an elected
official, he and his family faced racism. His children had to be
escorted to high school to protect them from mobs of bigoted white
youths. And because of his elegance, intelligence and ambition,
white politicians considered him dangerous.
   His attempt to run for governor was thwarted because whites
controlled the election machinery and blacks were divided. He
instead ran for the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> and was elected.
He also ran for the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Senate</ORGANIZATION> and was elected in <DATE>1873</DATE>. But after
three years of debate, the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> refused to seat him.
   ``I demand simple justice,'' <PERSON>Pinchback</PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>. ``I do
not care so far as I am personally concerned whether you give me my
seat or not. I will go back to my people and come here again; but I
tell you to preserve your own consistency. Do not make fish of me
while you make flesh of everybody else.''
   Pinchback's case drew attention from the national press. Said
the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Commercial Advertiser: ``Pinchback's presence in the
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. Senate</ORGANIZATION> is not open to the smallest objection, except the old
Bourbon war-whoops of color.
   ``<PERSON>Mr. Pinchback</PERSON> is the best dressed Southern man we have had in
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> from the <LOCATION>South</LOCATION> since the days when gentlemen were
Democrats.''

   To <PERSON>Sen. Robert C. Byrd</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>United States
Senate</ORGANIZATION> over the last 200 years has been a rock-bound channel, able
to contain the onrushing passions of the moment without losing its
essential and original shape and purpose.
   Byrd, in what he calls a ``labor of love,'' has pursued that
theme in a seven-pound history of the institution as it developed
over the past two centuries.
   The book, called ``The Senate _ 1789-1989'' and available
through the <ORGANIZATION>Government Printing Office</ORGANIZATION>, is a lavishly illustrated
and meticulous account based on 42 of the 100 speeches <PERSON>Byrd</PERSON>
delivered on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> in an unprecedented series
that began on a <DATE>spring</DATE> morning in <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   ``One of my two granddaughters was in the gallery with other
members of her fifth-grade class,'' <PERSON>Byrd</PERSON> recalls. ``I decided I
should mark the occasion by talking a little about the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and
its history for that class.
   ``I had no notes; I spoke for an hour,'' he said.
   On the next <DATE>Friday</DATE> his older granddaughter was in the gallery
and <PERSON>Byrd</PERSON> decided to make another speech in her honor.
   ``But I thought I ought to make a different speech, so I talked
about the traditions and the customs of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>. That's how it
started; that was the seed of the idea. I determined there was
fully enough material to do 100 speeches on the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>. I saw that
it was going to take a number of years.''
   For most of the next decade, when the business of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> had
been completed for the day, <PERSON>Byrd</PERSON> rose to advance his project
another notch, delivering what a generation of <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> clerks and
pages, and doorkeepers, reporters and fellow senators came to call
``Byrd's history lessons.''
   The result is a narrative history of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> from the
uncertain first steps of the first <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in the late winter and
<DATE>spring of 1789</DATE> through the calamity of civil war in the <DATE>1860s</DATE> and
the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Watergate</ORGANIZATION> investigation of the <DATE>1970s</DATE>.
   The assembly of those speeches into a book was a
``mini-Manhattan Project,'' <PERSON>Byrd</PERSON> says, proudly noting that he
proofread the book five times _ ``every comma, every colon, every
em-dash.''
   To <PERSON>Byrd</PERSON>, the most remarkable fact about the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>'s 200 years
is the way that historic themes tend to repeat themselves.
   Is there concern over the negative tone of last year's
presidential campaign? he asks.
   Then consider, <PERSON>Byrd</PERSON> says, the campaign of <DATE>1828</DATE> when the
partisans of <PERSON>John Quincy Adams</PERSON> called rival <PERSON>Andrew Jackson</PERSON> ``a
gambler, a drunkard and a duelist'' as well as an adulterer, and
<PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> supporters retaliated in kind, portraying <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> as ``a
monarchist, a gourmandizer and a spendthrift.''
   ``Slander was infectious,'' <PERSON>Byrd</PERSON> says.
   This year's 101st <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> opened with a donnybrook over a
proposed large congressional pay raise.
   Old hat, says <PERSON>Byrd</PERSON>.
   Pay squabbles date to the first <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and began in earnest in
<DATE>1816</DATE> when it was proposed that the pay rate of <MONEY>$6</MONEY> a day be changed
to a <MONEY>$1,500</MONEY> a year.
   The result: Public Outrage.
   The further result, according to <PERSON>Byrd</PERSON>: ``In the next election
two-thirds of the members of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> were defeated. Several
senators were also defeated and some resigned rather than stand for
re-election.''
   Also this year, the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> tied itself into emotional knots over
President's <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s nomination of former <PERSON>Sen. John Tower</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> to
be secretary of defense, a battle that led to <ORGANIZATION>Tower</ORGANIZATION>'s defeat.
   Nothing new in that, says <PERSON>Byrd</PERSON>.
   On a <DATE>March</DATE> day in <DATE>1843</DATE>, President <PERSON>John Tyler</PERSON>'s nomination of
Rep. <PERSON>Caleb Cushing</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> to be secretary of the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION>
was rejected three times in three roll call votes on a single day.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> was in a nasty mood that day. It twice rejected
<PERSON>Tyler</PERSON>'s nomination of Rep. <PERSON>Henry Wise</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> to be minister to
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and defeated his nominees to head the <ORGANIZATION>navy</ORGANIZATION> and war
departments and scuttled his nominee as minister to <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>.
   To top things off, the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> rejected <PERSON>Tyler</PERSON>'s nomination of
<PERSON>John Spence</PERSON> for a seat on the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s experience with the Tower nomination can't compare to
that, <PERSON>Byrd</PERSON> says.
   <PERSON>Byrd</PERSON> said he hopes his history, which is available from the
<ORGANIZATION>Government Printing Office</ORGANIZATION>, will be a contribution to the
institutional memory of the place.
   ``Nothing has changed in 200 years,'' <PERSON>Byrd</PERSON> said. ``The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> is
still guided by the Constitution and the knowledge that everything
that comes before it is just a new set of circumstances come to
center stage.''

   <PERSON>Paul McCartney</PERSON> says rock stars are
singing more about ecological issues because world leaders aren't
doing enough to protect the earth's environment.
   ``Governments _ especially <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> and <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON> _
aren't doing enough work,'' the former <ORGANIZATION>Beatle</ORGANIZATION> said at a news
conference <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   The 47-year-old singer, his wife, <PERSON>Linda</PERSON>, their children and his
band have been in Rio since <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> for two shows expected to
break attendence records.
   <PERSON>Jeff Baker</PERSON>, <PERSON>McCartney</PERSON>'s press spokesman, said 150,000 tickets
were sold for <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s show and all 175,000 tickets were sold for
today's concert at <ORGANIZATION>Rio</ORGANIZATION>'s Maracana soccer stadium, the world's
largest arena. Previously, the largest crowd to watch <PERSON>McCartney</PERSON> in
concert numbered 80,000.
   The Rio shows were to close a 33-city world concert tour. But
<PERSON>McCartney</PERSON> told reporters he was considering proposals to extend the
tour to <LOCATION>Liverpool</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> _ the Beatles' hometown _ in <DATE>May</DATE>.

HENEFELD A REAL STEAL FOR HUSKIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE BERKOWITZ, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it was over, they chanted: "Nadav! Nadav! Nadav!" 
</P>
<P>
But the scene was not <LOCATION>Hartford</LOCATION> Civic Center or <LOCATION>Gampel Pavilion</LOCATION> or <ORGANIZATION>Connecticut 
Field House</ORGANIZATION> or any other place the <ORGANIZATION>Connecticut Huskies</ORGANIZATION> have played this season. 
</P>
<P>
It was <LOCATION>Woodbury</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, in the locker room of <ORGANIZATION>Nonnewaug High School</ORGANIZATION>'s boys 
basketball team. And Nonnewaug had just defeated neighboring <ORGANIZATION>Gilbert School</ORGANIZATION> 
after making eight steals in the <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE> of a game in <DATE>January</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"They do that in practice too," said Nonnewaug Coach <PERSON>Darryl Morhardt</PERSON>. "Anytime 
somebody makes a steal, they all yell 'Nadav!' " 
</P>
<P>
On the nation's Hot Team of the 1989-90 season, <PERSON>Nadav Henefeld</PERSON> is searing. He 
is a 6-foot-7 1/2, 219-pound, nearly-22-year-old freshman forward from <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>. 
Second in the nation in steals, with a school-record 115 in 28 games. Among 
<LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>'s top three in scoring, rebounding, assists, field-goal shooting, 
three-point shooting, free-throw shooting and blocked shots. Smart. Handsome. 
In serious demand. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a legend here," said <PERSON>Steve Pikiell</PERSON>, a junior guard for the Huskies. "I'm 
serious. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wants to know where <PERSON>Nadav</PERSON> (pronounced nah-DUV) is. Everyone wants to 
know what he's doing. Everyone wants to know what he's doing after games. You 
go to parties, and everyone's like, 'Where's Nadav? Where's Nadav?' People have 
been waiting for a winner here, and he's stepped in and become everyone's 
hero." 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies never have finished higher than third in the <ORGANIZATION>Big East Conference</ORGANIZATION>. 
They have not finished higher than seventh since 1981-82. They were the only 
<LOCATION>Big East</LOCATION> team that did not participate in an <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> tournament during the <DATE>1980s</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
With the <LOCATION>Hartford Whalers</LOCATION> as virtually the only other winter sports diversion 
in the state, the Huskies are subjected to almost microscopic scrutiny from 
about 30 <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> media outlets. 
</P>
<P>
"This place," said the Bristol-raised Pikiell, "it's kind of crazy." 
</P>
<P>
And right now it's crazy for <PERSON>Nadav</PERSON>, who has been named Big East rookie of the 
week three times and became the first freshman to win the conference's 
player-of-the-week award. 
</P>
<P>
Henefeld grew up in Ramat-Hasharon, not far from <LOCATION>Tel Aviv</LOCATION>. He said he began 
dreaming about playing college basketball in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> when he was 
about 16. But like all Israelis, he went from high school to the military for 
three years of active duty. Not that this interfered with his basketball, you 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't in the army like a regular soldier," he said. "I had the basic 
training and that was it. The rest of my service in the army, I played more 
basketball than army. My service was as a sportsman, not as a regular soldier." 
</P>
<P>
He played for the Israeli national team, and began to acquire a reputation as 
one of his nation's best players. At about this time <DATE>last year</DATE>, with the end of 
his military-service commitment in sight, he wrote to about 20 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> colleges -- 
and received practically no response. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he was challenging <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>'s club-basketball system in court. Israeli 
players are assigned to clubs based on where they grew up. <PERSON>Henefeld</PERSON> didn't want 
to play for the club that owned his rights, but the courts ruled against him. 
</P>
<P>
That's where <PERSON>Marv Kessler</PERSON> and <PERSON>Schmuel Zisman</PERSON> stepped in. <PERSON>Zisman</PERSON> was the lawyer 
who represented <PERSON>Henefeld</PERSON>. He also happened to have played in <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> for 
<PERSON>Kessler</PERSON>, a former head coach at <ORGANIZATION>Adelphi</ORGANIZATION> who now is a scout for the <ORGANIZATION>Portland 
Trail Blazers</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Kessler</PERSON> saw <PERSON>Henefeld</PERSON> play in <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> and was convinced he could 
be a Division I player. 
</P>
<P>
So when <PERSON>Zisman</PERSON> told <PERSON>Kessler</PERSON> that <PERSON>Henefeld</PERSON> wanted to come to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, 
<PERSON>Kessler</PERSON> told one of his friends -- <ORGANIZATION>St. John's Coach Lou Carnesecca</ORGANIZATION>. At 
<PERSON>Kessler</PERSON>'s behest, <PERSON>Carnesecca</PERSON> invited <PERSON>Henefeld</PERSON> for a visit. At <ORGANIZATION>St. John</ORGANIZATION>'s 
expense, <PERSON>Henefeld</PERSON> arrived in <DATE>mid-April</DATE>. He liked everything about the school 
except its lack of dormitories. 
</P>
<P>
He ended up visiting <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> on the day he was scheduled to go home. 
</P>
<P>
"He was leaving for <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> at <TIME>9 p.m.</TIME>," <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>Jim Calhoun</PERSON> said. "We 
had (assistant) <PERSON>Dave Leitao</PERSON> drive down, pick him up at <TIME>5:30 in the morning</TIME>, and 
he spent that day here at UConn." 
</P>
<P>
It was a fine <DATE>spring</DATE> day, and <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>'s bucolic campus was more in line 
with <PERSON>Henefeld</PERSON>'s idea of what an American college should look like. Rolling, 
wooded hills instead of a concrete jungle. Dormitories instead of apartments. 
Yes, <PERSON>Henefeld</PERSON> decided during his hours in <LOCATION>Storrs</LOCATION>, this was the place. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> cemented the deal -- and satisfied his own questions about <PERSON>Henefeld</PERSON> -- 
by making a six-day trip to <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> in <DATE>July</DATE> for the <ORGANIZATION>Maccabiah Games</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
But there were complications. When <PERSON>Henefeld</PERSON> visited in <DATE>April</DATE>, he took the SAT 
but failed to attain the score required for eligibility as a freshman. 
Connecticut appealed to the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> to give him another chance in the <DATE>fall</DATE> because 
<PERSON>Henefeld</PERSON> didn't have a chance to prepare while in the army. The <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> granted 
it, but in order the get the results back quickly enough to play this season, 
<PERSON>Henefeld</PERSON> had to fly to <LOCATION>Raleigh</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION> at his own expense in mid-October to take 
the test. He missed the first two weeks of practice while awaiting the score, 
which was a passing one. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> received a mysterious letter, written in <LOCATION>Hebrew</LOCATION>, that 
claimed <PERSON>Henefeld</PERSON> had been paid to play in some games in <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>. Investigations 
by <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> officials showed otherwise. His first formal workout 
with the Huskies came on <DATE>Nov. 1</DATE> -- in an exhibition game against <ORGANIZATION>Marathon Oil</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Henefeld and the Huskies have been rolling since. They have set single-season 
school records for overall victories (24), <LOCATION>Big East</LOCATION> victories (11) and have 
attained their highest ranking. 
</P>
<P>
Point guard <PERSON>Tate George</PERSON>, their only senior, has become a consistent all-around 
player. Sophomore off-guard <PERSON>Chris Smith</PERSON> has blossomed into one of the nation's 
best back-court prospects. Junior guard <PERSON>John Gwynn</PERSON> has found happiness as a 
reserve, averaging 10.5 points in 17.2 minutes per game. Rod Sellers, the 6-9 
starting center, has become a scoring threat inside. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman swingman-baseball pitcher <PERSON>Scott Burrell</PERSON> spurned a huge contract offer 
from the <ORGANIZATION>Seattle Mariners</ORGANIZATION>, who made him their No. 1 draft choice last year, to 
become the third consecutive <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> high-school basketball player of the 
year to stay at home. Junior forwards <PERSON>Lyman DePriest</PERSON> and <PERSON>Murray Williams</PERSON>, and 
7-1 sophomore center <PERSON>Dan Cyrulik</PERSON> have become fine role players. 
</P>
<P>
That's where <PERSON>Henefeld</PERSON>'s special mix of basketball skills, on-and off-court 
experiences, and personability come in. Like a mason using mortar to construct 
a path, <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> has used <PERSON>Henefeld</PERSON> to magically bond the Huskies, creating a 
yellow brick road. 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Nadav</PERSON> has been the stabilizer," said <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON>, who came to <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> after 14 
years at <LOCATION>Northeastern</LOCATION>, where he took a Division II program and built it into a 
perennial <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> tournament participant that produced players such as <ORGANIZATION>Boston 
Celtics</ORGANIZATION> guard <PERSON>Reggie Lewis</PERSON>. "I think his age makes a difference, but he's a 
mature guy and he probably was mature at 18. The fact that he took on the 
Israeli club system a little bit helped. So, some of the things we see are 
chronological, but others are personality traits that make him somewhat unique. 
</P>
<P>
"If he was a kid with any kind of a sense of arrogance, I think it would be 
entirely different. He guards (his teammates') notoriety and their successes 
like he would an egg. He makes sure that does not crack." 
</P>
<P>
Henefeld seems to be even more captivating than those <LOCATION>Big East</LOCATION> imports who were 
all the rage for excellent teams last season -- <ORGANIZATION>Georgetown</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Dikembe Mutombo</PERSON> 
and <PERSON>Seton Hall</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Andrew Gaze</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Said <PERSON>George</PERSON>: "Everyone kind of calls me The Governor because after four years I 
know a lot of people. After one year he knows the whole state, so we're trying 
to figure out what to call him." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it's just the hurricane of attention that constantly swirls around the 
only show in a town smaller than <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, but perhaps it is the 
tremendous sense of pride <PERSON>Henefeld</PERSON> seems to inspire in his homeland and among 
Jews in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
He did nothing to hurt this in <DATE>November</DATE>, when, with the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION>'s and 
<LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>'s permission, he went home to play an Israeli national-team game 
against <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. He flew to <LOCATION>Tel Aviv</LOCATION> on <DATE>Nov. 18</DATE>, played on <DATE>Nov. 22</DATE> (scoring 23 
points in an <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> victory), left two hours after the game and rejoined the 
Huskies 26 hours later -- in <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> for the <LOCATION>Great Alaska Shootout</LOCATION>, where in 
three games he totaled 29 points, 15 rebounds and 13 steals. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli flag has been waved in the crowd at many <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> home games, 
media outlets in <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> phone the school's sports-information office after 
every game and Jewish publications from all over the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> have written 
stories on <ORGANIZATION>Henefeld</ORGANIZATION>. Like everything else, he has taken it in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy that I can make people feel good about themselves or about me 
playing well here, and I really appreciate it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He would rather be just one of the guys. One of his early highlights was being 
chewed out for the first time by <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON>, who can be wonderfully acerbic but 
was understandably gentle with <PERSON>Henefeld</PERSON> at first. 
</P>
<P>
Henefeld also wants to be viewed as a student, not as a basketball mercenary -- 
what some accused Gaze of being last year when, after helping lead <PERSON>Seton Hall</PERSON> 
to the Final Four, he promptly bolted for home. 
</P>
<P>
"The reasons I'm here are many," <PERSON>Henefeld</PERSON> said. "To play basketball, of course, 
but also to get an education and see another place and experience another 
culture. I think that other than an education, you can get so many things from 
seeing another place and living in another culture and meeting some new people. 
I think it helps you as a person. So it's not just the sport." 
</P>
<P>
This was the approach preached to him by <PERSON>Moti Daniel</PERSON>, an Israeli who played for 
<ORGANIZATION>George Washington</ORGANIZATION> from <DATE>1985</DATE> to <DATE>1987</DATE> and with whom <ORGANIZATION>Henefeld</ORGANIZATION> is friendly.

   Brilliantly colored fall foliage was coated with snow and ice
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> in the mountains of <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> and frost headed as far

   Showers and thunderstorms extended during the afternoon over

   The rain was mixed with snow in the <LOCATION>Appalachians</LOCATION> and changed

   Elsewhere in <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, 8 inches of snow accumulated at
<ORGANIZATION>Mount Mitchell</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mount Pisgah</ORGANIZATION> got a little more than an inch, the
<ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION> reported. The <ORGANIZATION>National Park Service</ORGANIZATION> closed
two sections of the <ORGANIZATION>Blue Ridge Parkway</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> because of
snow.
   ``I hear there is enough to scrape up a snowball,'' said <PERSON>Hugh
Morton</PERSON> at Grandfather Mountain.
   In eastern <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>, snow closed the <ORGANIZATION>Clingman Dome</ORGANIZATION> road in the
<LOCATION>Great Smoky Mountains National Park</LOCATION>, the weather service said.
   At lower elevations in <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, thunderstorms produced
locally heavy rain at <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>, including 1.50 inches in the six
hours up to <TIME>2 p.m. EDT</TIME>, and across much of <LOCATION>Mecklenburg County</LOCATION>,
flooding some streets and roads, the weather service said.
   Hail about an inch in diameter fell at <LOCATION>Locust</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>
   A tornado warning was issued for part of eastern <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>
after a waterspout was spotted offshore. The waterspout, a tornado
that forms over water, did not come ashore.
   Cold air headed southward across the <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> valleys
with temperatures expected to reach the low 30s by <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>
in <LOCATION>northern Alabama</LOCATION>, and the mid to upper 30s across central and
southern <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>.
   Frost advisories were posted over much of <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> and frost
warnings were issued over southwestern <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>. Advisories for frost
and freezing temperatures were posted over <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> and southeastern
<LOCATION>Lower Michigan</LOCATION>.
   Elsewhere, rain was scattered over western <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> state and
northeastern <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>.
   Rain extended from north-central and western <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> state
into northwestern <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>.
   Strong, gusty wind blew across the northern <LOCATION>Pacific Coast</LOCATION> during
the morning, with gusts reaching 44 mph at <LOCATION>Astoria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, 47 mph at
<LOCATION>Bellingham</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>, and 56 mph at Seaside, <LOCATION>Ore</LOCATION>.
   <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s low for the Lower 48 states was 19 degrees in
<LOCATION>Gunnison</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo</LOCATION>.
   Temperatures around the nation at <TIME>3 p.m. EDT</TIME> ranged from 34
degrees at <LOCATION>Chippewa County Airport</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, to 96 degrees at <LOCATION>Palm

<HEAD>CHARLESTOWN: Madoc legend.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``In professional archaeological circles, it's kind of
pooh-poohed,'' says <PERSON>Steve Cox</PERSON>, curator of the <ORGANIZATION>Tennessee State
Museum</ORGANIZATION>. ``There's no archaeological evidence. That's really all that
we have to go on in the prehistoric period.''
   The legend says the Welsh Indians were forced out of <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> by
the <ORGANIZATION>Cherokee Indians</ORGANIZATION>. Three separate northerly routes took them into
<LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Ohio River Valley</LOCATION>.
   American Indians apparently first spread the tale of a race of
White Indians who lived in the Falls of the <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> area, where <PERSON>Madoc</PERSON>'s
followers may have established their largest settlement.
   <PERSON>George Rogers Clark</PERSON>, the founder of <LOCATION>Clarksville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ind.</LOCATION>, first
heard the story from Tobacco, a chief of the Piankeshaws. He told of
a great battle between the <ORGANIZATION>Red Indians</ORGANIZATION> and White Indians on the <LOCATION>Ohio
River</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Sand Island</LOCATION> where all the White Indians were slain.
   Maj. <PERSON>John Harrison</PERSON>, among others, has told of an extensive
graveyard in that area, where thousands of human bones were buried
in such confusion as to suggest a battle. The graveyard, if it
existed, has been washed away.
   Some of <LOCATION>Clark County</LOCATION>'s earliest settlers reportedly found ancient
coins and European armor, some bearing the Welsh coat of arms. All
of that armor has disappeared.
   Clark found some skeletons adorned in armor that he thought were
ancient Welshmen and jotted down his findings in his personal
memoirs, <PERSON>Olson</PERSON> says. A copy of this book, in <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>'s own hand, was
stolen years ago from the <LOCATION>Jeffersonville</LOCATION> public library.
   ``<PERSON>Baird</PERSON>'s History of <LOCATION>Clark County</LOCATION>'' says that a tombstone, with
the date 1186, was found in <LOCATION>Jeffersonville</LOCATION> in the <DATE>1800s</DATE>. Early
pioneers reportedly found native Indians throughout the interior who
could converse in the Welsh language.
   A skull taken from <LOCATION>Sand Island</LOCATION> in the <DATE>1800s</DATE> was pronounced by a
<PERSON>Dr. Beckwith</PERSON> as ``not that of an Indian.'' Beckwith's qualifications
are not known.
   None of the evidence has been scientifically examined or
confirmed. In fact, virtually all of it has mysteriously disappeared.
   ``I wish I could reproduce everything that's been found or that
it had been put in a museum,'' <PERSON>Olson</PERSON> says. ``There are no museums
here.''
   Without such proof, archaeologists and other experts have their
doubts.
   ``Where you find prehistoric or human occupation you normally
find a range of evidence, such as refuse, garbage, settlements,
villages, sites, artifacts,'' says <PERSON>Gary Ellis</PERSON>, senior archaeologist
for the state of <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>.
   ``There just isn't any. Most of it is rumor.''
   More likely, Indian scholars say, the stone fort was built by
native American Indians.
   ``A lot of people don't like to believe the Indians could have
stacked rocks that size, but there's evidence around the country
they did things like that,'' says <PERSON>Donna Calhoun</PERSON> of rural <LOCATION>Scottsburg</LOCATION>,
who is writing a history of Indians in southern <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Ray White</PERSON>, tribal chairman of the <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> Indian nation, suggested
the coins, lamps, armor and other artifacts could easily have
traveled inland via the Indian trading network. A diary <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON>
uncovered during her research locates an Indian trading post 1{
miles east of <LOCATION>Charlestown</LOCATION>.
   Yet <PERSON>Olson</PERSON> says the evidence supporting the legend is overwhelming.
   ``What something like this does is alter the apple cart of
history,'' <PERSON>Olson</PERSON> says. ``Anytime you get all this and put it before
all these people who've got degrees in anthropology, it really turns
the table. They don't know how to combat it, so they say, `No, this
is a myth.'''
   An archaeological overview done in <DATE>1984</DATE> predicted the research
value of <ORGANIZATION>Devil</ORGANIZATION>'s Backbone could be quite high. Under federal law,
any Indian mounds and artifacts must be protected from development
there.
   They could provide a unique look into southern <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>'s early
beginnings.
   Or, they could lend credence to a legend and shatter accepted
theories on the discovery and exploration of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>.
   ``We need somebody to go into <LOCATION>Charlestown</LOCATION> and just do a survey,''
White says. ``They really need to find out what's there.
   ``It's bound to tell something about the early, early <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>
history, before what they're teaching in the schools. It's very
important.''

<LEADPARA>  At 7 p.m. Saturday, the crowd was gathering in the downtown Santa Cruz
courtyard of the Nickelodeon theater. A video crew was on the rooftop next
door. Movie fans with cameras milled about. People seemed nervous, expectant.;
  Rory Calhoun, one-time leading man to Marilyn Monroe and Betty Grable, was
coming home.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     <PERSON>Rita Bottoms</PERSON>, curator of special collections at the <ORGANIZATION>University of
California</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Cruz library</ORGANIZATION> and a "major fan" of <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON>'s, was there. She
talked about how she filled boxes with <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> newspaper clippings as a girl,
burned them when she went off to college (too old to have a crush on a movie
star), and always regretted it. At the edge of the crowd was 75-year-old
<PERSON>Walter Reed</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Santa Cruzan</LOCATION> whose acting credits included "Yellow Tomahawk," a
<DATE>1954</DATE> Western in which he appeared with <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON>. They hadn't seen each other in
more than 25 years.;   Shortly after <TIME>7:30 p.m.</TIME>, two shiny antique cars filled
with dignitaries pulled up by the sidewalk. <PERSON>Bruce Bratton</PERSON>, the bearded writer
and publicist who organized the event, stood on a bench and bellowed the
star's arrival.;   <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON>, star of "The Texan" on TV and, more recently,
"Motel Hell," stepped out of a '67 Cutlass convertible. His wife, Sue,
followed and the crowd exploded with applause. "I love you!" one woman
yelled.;   <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON>, 69, was wearing a cowboy hat, denim jacket, jeans and
black cowboy boots. His thick hair, once black, is now silver. His face is
thinner than in his matinee-idol days, but he still has those big, soulful
eyes that drove people crazy. Smiling and looking a bit overwhelmed by the
reception, <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> walked into the courtyard and shouted in his gravelly
voice, "Where's my cousin Tom?";   <PERSON>Tom Fast</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Scotts Valley</LOCATION>, stepped out of
the crowd into a hard embrace.;   Then came the proclamations honoring the
native son who moved to <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> with his mother in <DATE>1927</DATE> when he was 5, and
grew up running through its pear and apple orchards, playing hooky in the
hills outside town with his dog Rags, and generally getting into mischief in
what he calls "a real <PERSON>Tom Sawyer</PERSON> existence.";   Mayor <PERSON>Jane Yokoyama</PERSON> said the
city was lucky that <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> considered <PERSON>Santa Cruz</PERSON> to be his hometown.;   "No,
I'm lucky," <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> answered, teary-eyed.;   Then <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> got down on his
knees in front of a sidewalk square of wet cement -- the way the stars have
done it at <ORGANIZATION>Grauman</ORGANIZATION>'s Chinese Theater in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>. He leaned forward on all
fours, pressed his hands into the cement and wiggled them to leave two large
imprints. And he wrote this in the concrete: "My (hrt) is here. <PERSON>Rory Calhoun</PERSON>.
9-21-91";   "Leave room for your feet, honey," his wife advised him.;  
<PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> stepped into the bottom corner of the concrete square. His
immortalization completed, he pumped a hand in the air, and the crowd cheered
once again.;   (hbox);   Earlier in the day, the first of two filled with
events honoring <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> and raising money for <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> groups, he sat in his
hotel room. It overlooked the very beach where he dug holes in the sand to
cook potatoes 60 years ago, when he was known as <PERSON>Francis McCown</PERSON>. "<PERSON>David
Selznick</PERSON> gave me the name <PERSON>Rory Calhoun</PERSON>, and those are the only two names I've
known -- except sonofabitch," he says, laughing and dragging on a cigarette.; 
 His mother, <PERSON>Betty</PERSON>, was a waitress at <PERSON>Tommy Rudell</PERSON>'s coffee shop on <LOCATION>Pacific
Avenue</LOCATION> downtown, and they lived nearby -- right near where the <ORGANIZATION>Nickelodeon</ORGANIZATION> now
stands. The way <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> tells it, he was one rambunctious youngster: "You
could steal a couple of milk bottles off somebody's porch and turn 'em in at
the creamery for a nickel apiece, and maybe you'd steal four of 'em and you'd
have enough for candy for the whole day." He took his candy to the Unique
Theater on <LOCATION>Pacific Avenue</LOCATION> where he saw "King Kong," Buck Jones adventure
movies and lots of westerns.;   "Tell him about your dog, Rags," Sue <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON>
says. "I think that's where he got the nickname 'Smoke.' He and that dog would
disappear -- like smoke -- up in the hills and nobody knew where they were."; 
 "I had a .22 single-shot rifle," <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> says, picking up the story, "and I'd
take a frying pan, blanket, some matches and a bottle, and Rags, and I'd
disappear. Didn't matter if there was school or not; I'd disappear for a few
days. Go up there and catch some trout, shoot myself a rabbit and live it up.
Then they'd bring me back, and I'd sit in the police station every day after
school for a month.";   He says he was 9 years old.;   Run-ins with the law;  
<PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> moved to <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> with his mother in <DATE>1936</DATE>, was sent to reform
school for stealing cars, and returned to <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> <DATE>three years later</DATE>. He
attended <ORGANIZATION>Santa Cruz High School</ORGANIZATION> for three months, he says, "but I got bored
with that, so I stole a couple more cars and sold 'em, and they caught me."
The memory of the local police chief still gives him the jitters. Calhoun
returned to reform school near <LOCATION>Sonora</LOCATION> for another 2 1/2 years. "And that's why
I'm laughing -- when I was 17, they couldn't wait to get rid of me, and now
they're bringing me back!";   After his stint, he moved to <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>. World War
II was on, and he worked in a defense plant in <LOCATION>Sunnyvale</LOCATION>. "But that was kind
of like being in jail," he says, so he took a job with the <ORGANIZATION>state Division of
Forestry</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Felton</LOCATION>, fighting forest fires and building communication lines.
Around <DATE>St. Patrick's Day 1944</DATE>, he took a vacation to visit his grandmother in
<LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, and that's where his life changed.;   Waiting for a trolley in
<LOCATION>Culver City</LOCATION>, he was enlisted as an extra in a mob scene being filmed nearby.
He never found out what movie it was for, but "they gave me <MONEY>$37</MONEY>. I said,
'Jesus, how long has this been going on?' " Another of the extras, a hustler,
must have recognized <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON>'s good looks, because he dragged <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> to a
talent agency. The agency arranged a contract with <ORGANIZATION>20th Century Fox</ORGANIZATION> for
<PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON>, and the hustler took a cut.;   <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> doesn't have sleazy stories to
tell about the <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> crowd; producers didn't cheat him, fellow actors
didn't back-stab him. <PERSON>Edward G. Robinson</PERSON>, while filming "The Red House" in the
'40s, even showed <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> how to position himself before the camera so that
editors couldn't cut him out of close-ups with the star.;   In the mid-<DATE>'50s</DATE>,
while filming "River of No Return" with <PERSON>Marilyn Monroe</PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION>Canadian
Rockies</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> came down with a horrendous case of the flu: "I had all the
heat on in this room, and covered myself with blankets and what-have-you. It
must've been 110 degrees in that room; I decided I was just going to sweat it
out. Well, <PERSON>Marilyn</PERSON> was the only one who'd come in there and sit with me, put
cold cloths on my head, made me hot lemon and honey. I don't know if it
helped, but it sure was nice having someone there who cared.";   <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON>'s
heyday lasted only into the '60s, but he continued making films, more than 75
in all. There were "Mule Feathers," "Angel" and more than a dozen others
during the '70s and <DATE>'80s</DATE>. On television he appeared on "<LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> Five-O,"
"Fantasy Island" and "<PERSON>Hart</PERSON> to <PERSON>Hart</PERSON>." He had a leading role on the soap opera
"Capitol" from 1982-87. Nothing to bowl you over, to say the least. But even
at the height of his popularity, says old friend <PERSON>Walter Reed</PERSON>, <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> hadn't
taken himself too seriously.;   "Y'know, we have a deal in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> -- don't
believe your own publicity," <PERSON>Reed</PERSON> says, "and <PERSON>Rory</PERSON> never did that.";   (hbox); 
 After putting his bootprints in the cement <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> signed
autographs. Then everyone filed into the theater to watch "Way of A Gaucho" in
which <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> played an honorable, headstrong cowboy on the Argentine pampa.
His co-star in the film, made in <DATE>1952</DATE>, was <PERSON>Gene Tierney</PERSON> -- that was one
attractive couple.;   Before the film rolled, <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> stood onstage with
<PERSON>Bratton</PERSON> for some chitchat. The movie was made in <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Juan Peron</PERSON>, the
dictator, took more than a passing interest in its production. Peron, in fact,
stocked the production staff with ex-Nazi S.S. troops: "They'd come over after
the war and they were all on the picture," <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> said. "And at night, they'd
call <PERSON>Buenos Aires</PERSON> and report on every move we'd made that day. Who got drunk,
who got -- and all that kind of stuff.";   <PERSON>Calhoun</PERSON> cracked up at that
recollection. A few moments later, to more applause, he left the stage. He sat
down next to his wife -- sharing a big bowl of popcorn -- and the credits
rolled.  </TEXT>

<DATELINE>CAPE MAY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven score and one year ago, the <ORGANIZATION>A.
Lincoln</ORGANIZATION> who visited this seashore town may have been just a grocer
from <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>.
   But some residents continue to insist it was the future 16th
president who stayed in a hotel in this resort community on <DATE>July
31, 1849</DATE>.
   Those who dispute the tale say Lincoln, whose birthday comes
<DATE>Monday</DATE>, was in <LOCATION>Springfield</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, practicing law that long-ago <DATE>July
31</DATE>, winning a judgment of <MONEY>$112.30</MONEY> for a client. Casting further
doubt is a record of an <PERSON>Abel Lincoln</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> grocer who
they say may have headed to the Jersey shore that <DATE>summer</DATE> day.
   ``All these years, we may have been honoring a grocer,'' said
<PERSON>Jake Schaad</PERSON>, who has researched the story and is writing a book
about the history of Cape <DATE>May</DATE>.
   One version of the story claims that, while in <LOCATION>Cape May</LOCATION>, Lincoln
rejected an offer to become governor of the <ORGANIZATION>Oregon Territory</ORGANIZATION> after
his wife, <PERSON>Mary Todd Lincoln</PERSON>, told him she was afraid of Indians,
<PERSON>Schaad</PERSON> said.
   ``It's a good story but it didn't happen,'' <PERSON>Schaad</PERSON> said, adding
that other versions have Lincoln fathering an illegitimate son
while at the shore.
   The town claims to be <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s oldest seashore resort, tracing
its visitors to just after the Revolutionary War, said <PERSON>Jeffrey
Dorwart</PERSON>, a history professor at <ORGANIZATION>Rutgers University-Camden</ORGANIZATION> who is
researching a book for <LOCATION>Cape May County</LOCATION>'s 300th anniversary in <DATE>1992</DATE>.
   Some long-time residents knew <PERSON>Henry Irick</PERSON>, who said that when he
was 16 he came with his father and Lincoln to this community of
Victorian homes and lazy sea breezes.
   <PERSON>Mary Ann Nyblade</PERSON>, a 65-year-old Cape <DATE>May</DATE> resident who can trace
her family in the town back to <DATE>1695</DATE>, said she still clings to
<PERSON>Irick</PERSON>'s story.
   <PERSON>Irick</PERSON> was the son of <PERSON>John S. Irick</PERSON>, a wealthy Vincentown farmer
who supposedly met up with Lincoln and came to the <ORGANIZATION>Mansion House</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Cape May</LOCATION>. He recalled that visit in a newspaper interview in the
late 1890s and the story was born, <PERSON>Ms. Nyblade</PERSON> said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Mansion House</ORGANIZATION> guest register shows an <ORGANIZATION>A. Lincoln</ORGANIZATION> and wife
from <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> in Room 24. Fire destroyed the hotel in <DATE>1856</DATE> but
the register was saved, <PERSON>Ms. Nyblade</PERSON> said. She acknowledged that the
reference to <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> on the register was a problem for the
future-president theorists, but say the future president may have
listed <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> if they had taken the steamboat from there to
<LOCATION>Cape</LOCATION> <DATE>May</DATE>.
   The man who saved that register was <PERSON>Lewis Stevens</PERSON>, and the
250-page book is now in <LOCATION>Huntsville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>, in a safe-deposit box
owned by <PERSON>Bill Stevens</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ms. Nyblade</PERSON>'s nephew and a descendant of
<PERSON>Lewis Stevens</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Bill Stevens</PERSON> said in a telephone interview that the register
contains signatures of other famous people such as <PERSON>Sen. Henry Clay</PERSON>.
However, he said he has learned too much about Lincoln to believe
he could have visited Cape <DATE>May</DATE>.
   ``I'm convinced he was not in <LOCATION>Cape May</LOCATION> at that time,'' he said.
   There's no doubt about that, said <PERSON>Thomas F. Schwartz</PERSON>, curator of
the Lincoln collection at the <ORGANIZATION>Illinois State Historical Library</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Springfield</LOCATION>.
   On <DATE>July 31</DATE>, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> was at least 1,000 miles west of Cape <DATE>May</DATE>,
filing an affidavit in <ORGANIZATION>Sangamon County Circuit Court</ORGANIZATION> for <PERSON>Henry
Bailer</PERSON>, who was owed <MONEY>$111.75</MONEY> by <PERSON>Oliver Davis</PERSON>. Davis ended up paying
<MONEY>$112.30</MONEY>, which <PERSON>Schwartz</PERSON> guesses included interest.
   <PERSON>Dorwart</PERSON> said he can prove President <PERSON>Benjamin Harrison</PERSON> spent
summers in <LOCATION>Cape May</LOCATION>, as did President <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Grant and <PERSON>Woodrow Wilson</PERSON>
while he was governor of <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>. But Lincoln is a different
story.
   ``My sense is that, since looking at the Lincoln papers, he was
in <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Dorwart</PERSON> said.
   He said residents of <LOCATION>Cape May</LOCATION>, 50 miles south of the Mason-Dixon
Line and site of several duels between <ORGANIZATION>Northerners</ORGANIZATION> and Southerners
in the <DATE>1840s</DATE> and <DATE>1850s</DATE>, may have been trying to prove their loyalty
to the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> after the Civil War by circulating the story.
   Irick's tale probably cemented the story as fact, <PERSON>Dorwart</PERSON> said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Cape May County Historical Museum</ORGANIZATION> still features a facsimile
of the hotel register signature and everybody acknowledges that
some legends just seem to die hard.
   ``Even if Lincoln didn't come down here, it's part of our
culture that he was here,'' <PERSON>Dorwart</PERSON> said.

<HL> REVIEW &amp; OUTLOOK (Editorial): Ursula Meese, and Others </HL>
<SO> </SO>

<TEXT>
   Amid the stories about the two resigned <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> officials yesterday, the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post had another story: "Independent Counsel Subpoenas <PERSON>Ursula Meese</PERSON>'s Job Records." 
It now develops that Independent Counsel <PERSON>James McKay</PERSON> is investigating <PERSON>Mrs. Meese</PERSON>'s <MONEY>$40,000-a-year</MONEY> job with the <ORGANIZATION>Multiple Sclerosis Society</ORGANIZATION>. 
"According to sources familiar with <PERSON>McKay</PERSON>'s inquiry, the independent counsel has been trying to determine whether the Meeses' close friend, <PERSON>E. Bob Wallach</PERSON>, in effect helped supplement the Meeses' income by recommending <PERSON>Ursula Meese</PERSON> for the jobs." 
<PERSON>Mrs. Meese</PERSON>'s job is matching MS patients with employers. 

   Whatever is going on here, the one thing we may fairly conclude is that it is worthy of investigation. But if it merits the attention of special prosecutors and reporters, then the town may hold enough such stories to command the attention of many such investigations. Last <DATE>December</DATE>, a <ORGANIZATION>UPI</ORGANIZATION> reporter produced a long story listing 73 relatives of <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> members who have worked for <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in paid jobs since mid-1986. By law, members may not hire their own relatives, but the law says nothing about them working for other Members or for <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> itself.

<HL> Back at the Henry Horner Homes
---
By Alex Kotlowitz</HL>
<DD> 12/10/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<DATELINE> CHICAGO  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When a friend of mine takes the elevated train home to <LOCATION>Oak Park</LOCATION>, a western suburb here, she makes a point of sitting away from the window. 
She worries she might get hit by gunfire while passing the <ORGANIZATION>Henry Horner Homes</ORGANIZATION> project. 

   <PERSON>Pharoah Walton</PERSON>, age 9, lives in <PERSON>Henry Horner</PERSON>. 
For him, the shooting is so frequent and intrusive that he's learned over the years to look both ways before running when he hears gunfire. 

   Our inner-city neighborhoods, particularly public housing projects, have become islands of violence, isolated both geographically and in spirit from the rest of us. 
Delivery trucks and taxis dare not venture into these embattled neighborhoods, which are cordoned off by boulevards and highways rather than by walls or rivers. 
Many residents don't have telephones; there aren't even any supermarkets within walking distance. 
There is, say residents, a feeling of terrible aloneness. 

   Most disturbing, however, is how little we know or care about what happens on these inner-city reefs. 
Most of us are like my friend, for whom the neighborhood is a blur and the violence a momentary but passing threat. 

   Local newspapers and television news programs rarely report on stabbings and shootings at <PERSON>Henry Horner</PERSON>. 
Even the police, who must deal with it daily, don't record it all. 
<PERSON>Joseph Gardner</PERSON>, a former executive at the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Housing Authority</ORGANIZATION>, the landlord for the city's approximately 40,000 public housing units, concedes that "after 4:30 the gangs run these developments." 

   Indeed, they do. 
I regularly visited <ORGANIZATION>Henry Horner Homes</ORGANIZATION> over a period of three months to report an <DATE>Oct. 27</DATE> page one story of a 12-year-old's almost daily confrontation with violence. 
I have remained friends with <PERSON>Lafeyette Walton</PERSON> and his family, and just a few weeks ago met a 17-year-old friend of theirs. 
Later that night he was gunned down and killed. 

   It's hard to avoid trouble at the project. 
This <DATE>summer</DATE> 14-year-old <ORGANIZATION>Lolita Strong</ORGANIZATION> miraculously survived an errant bullet that lodged in her skull. 
One mother won't let her three young children play on the playground's rusted <ORGANIZATION>Jungle Gym</ORGANIZATION>. 
Instead, she moves all her furniture to the side and the living room becomes their "outside." 

   The police are overwhelmed by the problem and, perhaps, a bit fearful themselves. 
One foot patrolman told me he won't go above the first floor in <PERSON>Henry Horner</PERSON>'s high-rises without a partner. 
After a big gun battle early in the <DATE>summer</DATE> in which young gang members shot at each other from building to building like battleships at sea, I called the police department's central headquarters to ask what was on record about the shoot-out. 
I was told that if such combat took place, the newspapers would have written about it and the city's top police officials would have discussed it at their morning briefing. 
Thus it must not have happened. 

   But it did. 
I arrived at <PERSON>Henry Horner</PERSON> within half an hour of the shooting and, over the next few weeks, talked with residents (both children and parents), community workers and policemen -- all of whom recounted the battle. 

   The city's response to the growing violence has been muted at best. 
<PERSON>Henry Horner</PERSON> residents say the only contact they have with local politicians is around election time -- and even then it's nominal. 
<LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> narrowly averted losing control of the <ORGANIZATION>Housing Authority</ORGANIZATION> to the federal government in a power struggle that all but neglected the needs of the <ORGANIZATION>CHA</ORGANIZATION>'s tenants. 
But <PERSON>Sen. Bill Bradley</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>) on a recent trip to <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> visited five mothers from <PERSON>Henry Horner</PERSON> to discuss what might be done about the violence. 
The women asked for tighter security, better screening of tenants and a police phone number they could call with anonymous tips. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>CHA</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Gardner</PERSON> requested a meeting with me last month at which, in a kind of cathartic exercise, he reeled off the agency's frustration in trying to diminish the violence in the projects. 
In <DATE>August</DATE>, the agency replaced its security guards with off-duty police officers, he said, but funds for the program ran out in <DATE>October</DATE>. 
"CHA as a landlord can't solve this problem by itself," he sighed. 
As for <PERSON>Mr. Gardner</PERSON>, at the end of our meeting he said that he was leaving the agency the following week to run for a seat on the commission that oversees the city's sewage disposal. 

   Some compare <PERSON>Henry Horner</PERSON> and other such communities with war zones like <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Northern Ireland</LOCATION>. 
And there are similarities. 
In <LOCATION>Belfast</LOCATION>, for example, the <ORGANIZATION>IRA</ORGANIZATION> "kneecaps" people who have disobeyed its laws. 
In the projects, people are shot in the legs for disobeying the gangs' rules. 

   But there is one major difference: In <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Northern Ireland</LOCATION>, adults -- and children -- can direct their anger and bitterness toward political targets, with some long-shot aim of change. 
In <PERSON>Henry Horner</PERSON>, no such opponent or dream exists. 

   When the apartment next to the Waltons was firebombed this <DATE>fall</DATE>, there was no public outcry. 
No political leader came forth to say that this must stop. 
The news media didn't run major stories on the terrorist attack. 
The police didn't come out in full force. 
Even the local residents took it in stride. 
In the jargon of <PERSON>Henry Horner</PERSON>, just another apartment was "cocktailed." 

   <PERSON>Henry Horner</PERSON> is not an anomaly. 
In a memo to his staff, <PERSON>John Calhoun</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Crime Prevention Council</ORGANIZATION>, wrote of a recent visit to <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>, a city whose neighborhoods have become virtual battlefields: "When I worked on the streets with kids in the '60s, there was also the grinding poverty visible in <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>, perhaps more, but there was a difference. 
People were on the sidewalk and in the streets; the church was still a powerful voice; whatever shred of family existed spoke with authority. 
There was hope. 
Facing the <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> {of today}, I was frightened -- not for my safety, but for the future of these children . . . . 
The kids are colossally, terribly alone." 

   Says a mother at <ORGANIZATION>Henry Horner Homes</ORGANIZATION>: "Bringing up a child where I do, you can lose them." 
Indeed, we've already lost entire communities. 

   Within days after my story on <PERSON>Lafeyette Walton</PERSON> came out, the family heard that the gangs were angry about the article. 
So Lafeyette's mother, LaJoe, panicked and took <PERSON>Lafeyette</PERSON>, <PERSON>Pharoah</PERSON> and her four-year-old triplets to her sister's house in a nearby neighborhood. 

   "Then I had time enough to think," she recalls. 
"What am I running for if I ain't done nothing? 
I was afraid when I left. 
I was just mostly hurting when I came back." 
The gangs, thank God, have not harmed the Waltons. 
But <PERSON>Mrs. Walton</PERSON> says she stays up nights worrying about her children. 
So might we all.
