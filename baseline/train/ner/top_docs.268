   LOS ANGELES -- Caesars World Inc. said it agreed in
principle to increase by 25 cents a share, to $22.25 a share,
or $48.4 million, its tender offer for the 13.4% stake it
doesn't already hold in Caesars New Jersey Inc.
   The sweetened offer is part of a settlement of litigation
brought by certain shareholders of Caesars New Jersey. They
charged that, among other things, the company's original
$47.9 million offer was inadequate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Caesars World, an owner and operator of hotels and
casinos, also extended its offer to <DATE>Sept. 7 from today</DATE>, and
said it might further extend the offer until final court
approval of the settlement, which isn't expected for at least
two months. <ORGANIZATION>Caesars New Jersey</ORGANIZATION> owns and operates <LOCATION>Caesars
Atlantic City</LOCATION>, a hotel and casino.
   <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> also agreed to amend its offer to pay
interest on <MONEY>$22</MONEY> a share if the offer is extended more than 30
days after the mailing of supplemental offer materials
describing the settlement and the amendment. The mailing is
expected this week.
   <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> also agreed that if it purchases at least
549,792 <ORGANIZATION>Caesars New Jersey</ORGANIZATION> shares, giving <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> at
least <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> of the outstanding shares, it will merge <ORGANIZATION>Caesars
New Jersey</ORGANIZATION> with <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> or a <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary.
In the merger, shareholders would receive <MONEY>$22.25</MONEY> a share,
without interest. Of the 2,175,945 <ORGANIZATION>Caesars New Jersey</ORGANIZATION> shares
that <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> doesn't already own, about 1.5 million had
been tendered as of yesterday.

Jersey Inc. with the New Jersey Casino Control Commission in
connection with Caesars World's pending tender offer for

   <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc.</ORGANIZATION> dropped its <MONEY>$960 million</MONEY> recapitalization plan, which <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> gambling regulators refused to approve, and instead launched a tender offer to buy back <PERCENT>31%</PERCENT> of its shares at a cost of <MONEY>$325 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$374 million</MONEY>. 

   The operator of casino hotels began today a so-called Dutch auction tender offer for 11 million of its shares. 
Caesars said shares must be tendered at prices between <MONEY>$29.50</MONEY> and <MONEY>$34</MONEY> each. 
Under the Dutch auction procedures, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> will accept shares in the order of their specified prices, beginning with the lowest price, until the total reaches 11 million. 
The highest price required to reach the 11 million total will then be paid to all shares accepted. 

   Caesars shares closed <DATE>Friday</DATE> at <MONEY>$29.25</MONEY>, up <MONEY>50 cents</MONEY>, in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading. 
The offer will expire at <TIME>12:01 a.m. EDT</TIME> <DATE>Oct. 6</DATE> unless extended, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> said. 

   Caesars said it has been advised by its lawyers that the tender offer doesn't require approval by <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> gaming regulators. 
However, the company, which has casinos in both states, said if the regulators rule that their approval is required, Caesars reserves the right to cancel the offer. 

   Caesars also said the offer is conditioned on arranging the necessary financing of as much as <MONEY>$400 million</MONEY>, including expenses of the offer. 
Caesars said the offer would be financed with issuance of subordinated debt and bank borrowings. 
The company said its investment banker, <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, has advised that it is "highly confident" that the necessary debt securities can be sold. 

   <PERSON>Henry Gluck</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer, said, "We believe that the purchase of shares through the offer constitutes an attractive investment for our company at this time because of recent market prices for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION>'s shares, the company's reduced level of long-term debt and our business and financial prospects." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON> said the offer "should help to normalize the <LOCATION>Caesars World</LOCATION> shareholder base," which he said the company believes includes "a high percentage of short-term investors who purchased or held <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> stock in anticipation of receiving a dividend under the recapitalization plan." 

   The recapitalization plan, which was rejected <DATE>Aug. 12</DATE> by the <ORGANIZATION>New Jersey Casino Control Commission</ORGANIZATION>, would have paid a one-time cash dividend of <MONEY>$26.25</MONEY> to shareholders. 

   Caesars said yesterday it will withdraw its request that the <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> commission reconsider its rejection of the recapitalization plan. 
A hearing on the request was scheduled for tomorrow. 

   In rejecting the plan, the <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> commission said it "lacks any clear business" purpose and serves to "greatly enrich and permanently entrench" current management. 

   Caesars devised the recapitalization plan to fight off an unwanted takeover bid from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investor <PERSON>Martin T. Sosnoff</PERSON>, who currently holds about <PERCENT>11%</PERCENT>, or 4.2 million shares, of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION>. 

   A representative for <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> said yesterday that <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> hadn't seen the offering papers and will withhold comment until he does. 

   In explaining its decision to abandon the recapitalization plan, in which the company would have issued <MONEY>$960 million</MONEY> of new debt to pay the dividend, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> said it was advised by its lawyers that regulatory approval of the plan was unlikely. 
Caesars also cited "volatility of the financial markets and the effects of delay and uncertainty." 

   Caesars said neither the company nor its directors were expressing an opinion on whether shareholders should tender their shares under the company's offer. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON>, however, said in a statement that the offer "provides all shareholders with a means of liquidating a portion and possibly all of their <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> shares without the market disruption that might otherwise occur if they were sold in the open market." 

   A <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said all trades of post-dividend <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> shares, which were made on a when-issued basis, will be canceled because the dividend won't be paid.

announced intention to make a tender offer for the 13.4%
stake it doesn't already hold in Caesars New Jersey Inc.
   In a suit filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, an
investor alleges that the company's $22-a-share, or $48
million, offer is inadequate and that it didn't seek
competing acquisition proposals. Another suit filed in state
court by four investors names 10 officers and directors of
the company as defendants and seeks an injunction blocking
the offer. Caesars World, based in Los Angeles, owns and

   <PERSON>Martin T. Sosnoff</PERSON> said he had discussions with <ORGANIZATION>Pratt Hotel Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Southmark Corp.</ORGANIZATION> about a possible joint venture to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The money manager and investor said that he, <PERSON>Pratt</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Southmark</ORGANIZATION> may jointly discuss with Caesars World a "friendly" transaction in which the three would "participate on an equal basis" in a joint venture. 

   The discussions among the three parties "are not currently being actively pursued," <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> said in a news release. 
He added that it was uncertain whether talks would resume in the future. 
While <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> didn't say when the discussions had occurred, <LOCATION>Pratt</LOCATION> is understood to have initiated the talks about two weeks ago. 
<ORGANIZATION>Southmark</ORGANIZATION>, which owns <PERCENT>36%</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Pratt</LOCATION>, was brought in soon after. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> wasn't available to comment, but a source close to him said "these guys (<LOCATION>Pratt</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Southmark</ORGANIZATION>) approached him and he thought it could be a good deal." 

   Dallas-based Pratt is a hotel and casino owner. 
<ORGANIZATION>Southmark</ORGANIZATION>, also based in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, has interests in real estate and financial services, and is a major hotel franchisee. 

   As previously reported, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s $28-a-share tender offer for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION>, a Los Angeles-based gambling concern, was rejected as "inadequate" last week. 
He is <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION>'s largest shareholder -- with a <PERCENT>13.6%</PERCENT> stake. 

   A <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> spokesman declined comment on <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s statement. 

   Separately, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> said he extended the expiration date of his offer for the <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> common stock he doesn't already own to 12:01 a.m. 
<DATE>May 16 EST</DATE>. 
The offer had been scheduled to expire on <DATE>April 3</DATE>. 
So far, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> said, "only a negligible number of shares have been tendered" under the offer, which began earlier this month. 

   In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION>'s common closed at <MONEY>$28.75</MONEY>, down <MONEY>87.5 cents</MONEY>. 
Some Wall Street traders said that any <ORGANIZATION>Southmark</ORGANIZATION> and Pratt involvement with <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> would make it less likely that a bidding war for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> would erupt. 

   Caesars World's financial adviser, <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, is understood to have contacted a number of companies to drum up interest in a friendly purchase of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Southmark</ORGANIZATION> was among the companies that <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> contacted in the past two weeks, sources said. 

   <PERSON>William S. Friedman</PERSON>, vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Southmark</ORGANIZATION>, said that "a prime factor in our getting involved is that we're licensed (to operate casinos) in both <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>," where <LOCATION>Caesars World</LOCATION> has hotels. 

   <PERSON>Jack E. Pratt Sr.</PERSON>, <PERSON>Pratt</PERSON> chairman, said <PERSON>Pratt</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Southmark</ORGANIZATION> will say today in a <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> filing that they are having talks with <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> on a possible joint venture. 
He said the companies "plan to work with <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> on a friendly basis." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> said that "several preliminary contacts" with <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> representatives haven't "resulted in any indication that (<LOCATION>Caesars World</LOCATION>) wishes to" negotiate with him, <PERSON>Pratt</PERSON> or <ORGANIZATION>Southmark</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investor's bid had been conditioned on his obtaining approval to control casinos from gaming authorities in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> said yesterday that he hasn't been assured that "the necessary regulatory review would be completed on or prior to the original expiration date" of his tender offer. 
He said if the approval process is delayed, he may have to again extend the expiration date. 

   A source familiar with both <ORGANIZATION>Southmark</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Pratt</PERSON> said that while <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> could raise the <MONEY>$725.2 million</MONEY> needed to complete his offer, the investor felt "he needed an experienced hotel operator to convince people he was serious about really" buying <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION>.

   <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc.</ORGANIZATION> is exploring restructuring or the sale of the company to a friendly suitor after rejecting <ORGANIZATION>Martin T. Sosnoff</ORGANIZATION>'s <MONEY>$28-a-share</MONEY> tender offer for the gambling concern as "inadequate." 

   A source familiar with <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> said that the primary options that the Los Angeles-based company and its financial advisers are studying are a management-sponsored leveraged buyout or a major stock buyback. 

   The suggestion that competing bidders might be sought spurred an increase in the price of Caesars shares. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> stock closed at <MONEY>$29.375</MONEY> a share, up <MONEY>$1.375</MONEY>, on heavy volume. 

   But <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>, which owns and operates the <ORGANIZATION>Caesars Palace</ORGANIZATION> luxury hotel-casino in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nev.</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Caesars New Jersey</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION>, declined to say whether it had already begun talks with other parties about a competing offer. 

   In a <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> filing <DATE>Friday</DATE>, the company said that the mention of possible suitors "might jeopardize the continuation of any discussions or negotiations that the company may conduct." 

   In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' largest shareholder, said he still seeks a "friendly acquisition" of the company despite its rejection of his offer. 
<PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> said he believes his offer is fair to all of the company's shareholders and represents a significant premium over recent and historic prices for the company's shares. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> is understood to be considering the possibility of increasing his bid for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>. 
"He feels he has access to the means to up the ante," said an individual familiar with <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s bid for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>. 
"Whether he will is a matter of further study for him." 

   In rejecting <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s bid for the 25.9 million <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> common shares he doesn't already own, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> cited "uncertainties" in the offer, including the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> money manager's ability to finance the bid and to win <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> regulatory approval allowing him to become a casino operator. 

   Caesars said in the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> filing that <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s bid "raises serious legal questions under the federal securities law," but didn't elaborate. 
The company said its financial adviser, <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, issued a written opinion concurring with its decision to spurn <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s bid. 

   Some stock analysts and Wall Street traders speculated that other possible buyers for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> might include <ORGANIZATION>UAL Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the Chicago-based parent of <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> real estate developer <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON>, investor <PERSON>Kirk Kerkorian</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Las Vegas-based Golden Nugget Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 

   But <PERSON>Mr. Kerkorian</PERSON> has denied that he is interested in <LOCATION>Caesars</LOCATION> and a source close to <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> said the developer has "zero interest" in the company. 
<ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> officials weren't available to comment, but a source familiar with the company said that while <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> "could be interested," it "would take a long time and be a big hassle (for <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>) to get licenses" to own and operate casinos in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>. 

   Golden Nugget, which is already licensed to own and operate casinos in both states, has plenty of available cash if it wishes to make an offer for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>. 
While officials of the hotel and casino concern weren't available to comment, sources familiar with <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> said that the company's management isn't likely to accept a Golden Nugget bid. 
"They'd rather have Sosnoff than Golden Nugget," said one of the sources, adding that Golden Nugget's chairman, <PERSON>Steve Wynn</PERSON>, "would probably fire everyone in a month," and that <PERSON>Caesars</PERSON>' chairman, <PERSON>Henry Gluck</PERSON>, "is smart enough to know that." 

   Neither <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON> nor any of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' advisers have had any conversations with <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> or his representatives since <DATE>last Monday</DATE>, sources said. 
But <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON> may be reeling from his first contact with <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> as a bidder for Caesars <DATE>March 8</DATE>. 

   According to one source, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> first notified <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON> in a phone call to <ORGANIZATION>Caesars Palace</ORGANIZATION> that a tender offer was to be announced in a newspaper advertisement last <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>. 
When the investor reached <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON> by telling a receptionist that the call was urgent, the <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> chairman was on the dais at a televised celebration of the <DATE>20th anniversary of</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Caesars Palace</ORGANIZATION>, which was about to begin. 

   The source said that the surprised <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON> is understood to have responded, "<PERSON>Marty</PERSON>, I always knew you'd come after me some time." 

   Separately, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' lawyers appeared in federal court in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> <DATE>Friday</DATE> to argue that a suit <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> filed against the company should be considered instead in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. 
As previously reported, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s complaint, filed last <DATE>Monday</DATE>, alleges that <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> and its directors breached their fiduciary duty to shareholders by approving anti-takeover measures last year. 
A decision on the matter is expected later this week.

<HL> Caesars World's Move to Abandon Plan
For Recapitalization Praised by Analysts

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc.</ORGANIZATION>'s decision to drop its <MONEY>$960 million</MONEY> recapitalization plan in favor of a stock buy-back was praised by financial analysts, although the stock market reaction was less sanguine. 

   In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> shares closed at <MONEY>$29.50</MONEY>, up <MONEY>25 cents</MONEY>, on volume of 749,600 shares. 

   Under the original recapitalization, devised to fend off an unwanted takeover bid from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investor <PERSON>Martin T. Sosnoff</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> holders would have received a one-time dividend of <MONEY>$26.25</MONEY> a share and stock in the reconstituted company. 
The tender offer that replaced that plan will be at prices between <MONEY>$29.50</MONEY> and <MONEY>$34</MONEY> a share, or a total of between <MONEY>$325 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$374 million</MONEY> for 11 million of Caesars 35.2 million shares outstanding. 

   "This is probably what Caesars should have done in the beginning," said <PERSON>Harold Vogel</PERSON>, a securities analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
He said the new plan leaves the hotel-casino concern with far less debt and would be more acceptable to <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> gambling regulators, if regulators need to approve the buy-back at all. 

   The earlier recapitalization plan was rejected by <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> gambling regulators <DATE>Aug. 12</DATE> on the grounds that it loaded Caesars with debt while lacking a clear business purpose and serving to "greatly enrich and permanently entrench" current management. 

   Caesars, operator of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars Palace</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nev.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Caesars Atlantic City</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, needed both states' approval for the recapitalization. 
After announcing the tender offer, the company said it planned to withdraw an application for the <ORGANIZATION>New Jersey Casino Control Commission</ORGANIZATION> to rehear the recapitalization case. 
Caesars said it doesn't believe the stock buy-back requires state regulatory approval. 

   <ORGANIZATION>New Jersey Casino Control Commission</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Walter N. Read</PERSON> said he wasn't sure whether the commission would need to approve the plan. 
He said <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> "has obviously gotten rid of some of the things we objected to in the recapitalization," but he declined to say whether he favors the buy-back. 
Nevada gambling officials weren't available for comment. 

   Industry observers said that the buy-back leaves Caesars more vulnerable to a takeover attempt than it would have been under a recapitalization. 
The buy-back "provides less of a guarantee" against takeover attempts, said <PERSON>Mr. Vogel</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION>. 
He added, however, that "I don't see anyone coming in after these gaming companies now anyhow because of the enormous licensing problems." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Vogel</PERSON>, however, didn't rule out the possibility of <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> making another pass at <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> holds 4.2 million Caesars shares, or about <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT> of the total outstanding, and his stake would increase to <PERCENT>17.4%</PERCENT> if he didn't tender shares under the company's offer. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> hasn't been available for comment since <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> announced plans for the tender offer <DATE>Monday</DATE>. 

   But <PERSON>Marvin B. Roffman</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Philadelphia-based Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, said he "can't see Sosnoff jumping in at all." 
<PERSON>Mr. Roffman</PERSON> said he believes <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> "saw the writing on the wall" when the <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> commission rejected the Caesars plan, and thus wouldn't tempt the same fate by renewing his highly leveraged bid. 
<PERSON>Mr. Roffman</PERSON> said the state commission ruling delivered a message that "we don't want someone coming in here and leveraging up a company to take control of it." 

   Under the buy-back, which began yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> will purchase about <PERCENT>31%</PERCENT> of its shares outstanding through a so-called Dutch auction tender offer. 
Caesars will accept the shares in the order of the prices that holders have specified, within the stated range, until total shares tendered reach 11 million. 
The highest price required to reach the total will then be paid to holders of all the shares accepted. 
The offer ends at <TIME>12:01 a.m. EDT</TIME> <DATE>Oct. 6</DATE>, unless extended. 

   The stock market reaction to the new plan "shows that the arbitragers, who seem to be the dominant holders, are disappointed that <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> isn't pursuing another recapitalization," said <PERSON>Mark Manson</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>New York-based Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette</ORGANIZATION>. 
But he said the buy-back leaves Caesars a "fairly attractive" investment, with a much stronger balance sheet and healthier earnings potential than if the company had followed through with the recapitalization.

Is Rejected by New Jersey Commission

   The <ORGANIZATION>New Jersey Casino Control Commission</ORGANIZATION> rejected <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc.</ORGANIZATION>'s proposed <MONEY>$960 million</MONEY> recapitalization, saying it "lacks any clear business purpose." 

   Commission Chairman <PERSON>Walter N. Read</PERSON> said he had "very real doubt about the financial responsibility of the proposal," which <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> designed earlier this year to thwart a takeover attempt by <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investor <ORGANIZATION>Martin T. Sosnoff</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> in <DATE>June</DATE> dropped a sweetened <MONEY>$35-a-share</MONEY> bid for the company and said he couldn't justify the cost of continuing the <MONEY>$1.11 billion</MONEY> takeover effort. 
He couldn't be reached yesterday to comment on the ruling. 

   The recapitalization plan, which calls for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' shareholders to receive a one-time cash dividend of <MONEY>$26.25</MONEY> a share and stock in the reconstituted company, was approved by shareholders last month. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Read</PERSON> said the plan will burden Caesars with "staggering debt." 
He added that <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' management "proposes to pile on this financial burden to pay shareholders a huge dividend to foster their approval of proposals, which will greatly enrich and permanently entrench present corporate officials." 

   Los Angeles-based Caesars, operator of the <ORGANIZATION>Caesars Palace</ORGANIZATION> hotel-casino in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nev.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Caesars Atlantic City</LOCATION> hotel-casino in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, said it was "disappointed" with the commission's ruling, but declined to comment further. 
The company is awaiting an <DATE>Aug. 20</DATE> ruling from the <ORGANIZATION>Nevada Gaming Commission</ORGANIZATION> on the recapitalization plan. 

   The <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> commission, which has regulatory authority over the state's gambling operations and is empowered to issue and revoke gambling licenses, voted 4-1 against the plan. 
A favorable vote by at least four commissioners was required for approval of the Caesars plan. 

   Commissioner <PERSON>Valerie H. Armstrong</PERSON> cast the only vote in support of the plan, saying <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> had provided sufficient evidence that it wouldn't buckle under the strain of the <MONEY>$960 million</MONEY> of new debt required to finance the recapitalization. 

   After the commission's action, one Wall Street executive suggested that <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> might sell its <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> operations, using proceeds to help recapitalize the company -- a move that would be similar to one by Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION>Hilton Hotels Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
After <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> in <DATE>1985</DATE> denied <ORGANIZATION>Hilton</ORGANIZATION> a casino license for its <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION> hotel, it sold the property to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> real estate developer <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> had dropped his bid one week after receiving an unfavorable federal court ruling. 
In <DATE>June</DATE>, a federal judge in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> enjoined him from continuing his tender offer on the ground that it violated a <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve Board</ORGANIZATION> rule governing the financing of corporate takeovers. 

   Still, <PERSON>Mr. Read</PERSON> rejected <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' claim that it needed to proceed with the recapitalization even after <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> dropped his bid. 
"It is unclear why another takeover effort would be inevitable, considering the results of the last such effort and the regulatory hurdles involved," <PERSON>Mr. Read</PERSON> said. 
He also said it wasn't clear "why a takeover would necessarily be disadvantageous to the stockholders if the bidder received regulatory approvals." 

   In issuing its ruling, the commission attempted to distinguish the <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> plan from a similar <MONEY>$2.6 billion</MONEY> recapitalization of <ORGANIZATION>Holiday Corp.</ORGANIZATION> approved by the commission in <DATE>April</DATE>. 
<LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, Tenn.-based Holiday, a hotel and gambling concern, proposed its plan last <DATE>November</DATE> when it was rumored to be a takeover target. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Read</PERSON> described the Holiday plan as essentially "an acceleration" of a long-term strategy to dispose of assets and move toward managing properties instead of owning them. 
But he said that <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> recapitalization plan would replace an existing policy of pursuing internal growth and expansion. 
He added that <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> proposes to "abandon a prudent, successful corporate strategy for an imprudent, risky one." 
The company's equity, he added, would become "a lowly foothill beneath its Alpine debt." 

   Securities analysts who follow the gambling industry were surprised by the <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> commission's action. 
And one said he expects Caesars to appeal the ruling. 

   "It's palpably absurd, especially because this is the commission" that approved the <ORGANIZATION>Holiday Corp.</ORGANIZATION> plan, said <PERSON>Steven Eisenberg</PERSON>, an analyst with Bear, <ORGANIZATION>Stearns &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION> "Caesars has adequately demonstrated that its cash flows are such that it won't have to sell one asset, and can still generate cash to service the debt. 
That suggests the company is very, very strong," <PERSON>Mr. Eisenberg</PERSON> said. 

   The <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> action came after the close of the stock market yesterday. 
In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> shares closed at <MONEY>$35.125</MONEY>, off <MONEY>12.5 cents</MONEY>. 

   Caesars operates its <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION> hotel-casino through an <PERCENT>86.6%</PERCENT>-owned subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars New Jersey Inc</ORGANIZATION>.

   <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc.</ORGANIZATION>'s stock price rose sharply yesterday, indicating that investors expect competing bids to follow <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investor <ORGANIZATION>Martin T. Sosnoff</ORGANIZATION>'s <MONEY>$28-a-share</MONEY> offer for the Los Angeles-based gambling concern. 

   Meanwhile, <PERSON>Henry Gluck</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>, said the company's board will study the <ORGANIZATION>Sosnoff</ORGANIZATION> offer with legal and financial advisers before making a recommendation to holders. 
A spokesman declined to comment further on <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s offer, valued at <MONEY>$725.2 million</MONEY>, for the <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> shares he doesn't already own. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> holds a <PERCENT>13.6%</PERCENT> stake in <LOCATION>Caesars</LOCATION>, or about 4.1 million of the 30 million shares outstanding. 

   In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> common closed at <MONEY>$27.75</MONEY> a share, up <MONEY>$3.25</MONEY>, on volume of 3.3 million shares. 

   Some securities analysts who follow the gambling industry suggested that higher bids are likely and that <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> might have positioned himself to turn a profit on his current Caesars stake. 

   "He hasn't ever bought and run a company, and he probably would accept a higher offer for his shares," <PERSON>Dennis Forst</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles-based Seidler Amdec Securities Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said. 
He said yesterday's trading, in which <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> shares rose as high as <MONEY>$28.50</MONEY> before easing slightly, suggests that Wall Street believes "this is the first salvo (in bidding for Caesars), but not the last." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Forst</PERSON> said he believes Caesars management "definitely prefers to remain independent and build the company along current lines." 

   <PERSON>Marvin B. Roffman</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, said acquiring Caesars at <MONEY>$28</MONEY> a share would be "a steal." 
He said he believes <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s real goal is "to make money buying undervalued situations" rather than by operating casinos. 

   Among parties analysts mentioned as possible competing bidders are <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> investor <PERSON>Kirk Kerkorian</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Tracinda Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Nev.-based Golden Nugget Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, both of which have experience with the kind of luxury hotel-casino operations that <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> represents. 

   A spokesman for <PERSON>Mr. Kerkorian</PERSON>, however, said <ORGANIZATION>Tracinda</ORGANIZATION> isn't interested in bidding for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>, which operates the <ORGANIZATION>Caesars Palace</ORGANIZATION> casino in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION> among other properties and owns <PERCENT>86.6%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars New Jersey Inc</ORGANIZATION>. Golden Nugget officials couldn't be reached for comment. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>, who made his offer through newly formed <ORGANIZATION>MTS Acquisition Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, continued to insist yesterday that his offer is "for real" and dismissed speculation that it might be an attempt to put Caesars in play in the takeover field. 

   The investor also gave some details of his financing plans, which he said involve loan commitments valid for six months. 
In a letter to <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON>, he said <ORGANIZATION>Marine Midland Bank</ORGANIZATION> had agreed to lend <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> for the acquisition and to use its "best efforts" to syndicate an additional <MONEY>$400 million</MONEY> in loans. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> also said in the letter that his financial adviser, <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, had said in writing that, "subject to market conditions," it is "highly confident" it can arrange commitments for as much as <MONEY>$475 million</MONEY> in financing. 
He said the offer "provides a fair and generous opportunity for all the company's shareholders to maximize the value of their investment." 

   He made the tender offer for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> without consulting the company or its board, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> said, because his advisers had "repeatedly stressed" the Caesars management's "lack of responsiveness in the past." 

   Caesars World, which last year turned down <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s request for a seat on the board, retained <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION> to help study the offer. 
Although <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> traditionally has served as its investment banker, the firm also has represented <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> before. 
It managed the investor's initial public offering last year of <ORGANIZATION>Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, of which <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> is chairman. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> vigorously denied a report that he had tried to sell his <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> stake to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> real estate developer <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON>. 
A source close to <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> yesterday said he had been offered the <PERSON>Sosnoff</PERSON> stake "within the last month." 
<PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> said: "That's absolutely incorrect. 
I haven't talked to <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON> at all about Caesars." 
He said <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON>'s attorney called him about <DATE>two months ago</DATE>, but said, "I never returned the call." 

   Separately, <ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said they were considering downgrading <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> debt ratings because of the Sosnoff offer. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Moody's</ORGANIZATION> said it is reviewing its single-B-1 rating on about <MONEY>$215 million</MONEY> of subordinated debt of <LOCATION>Caesars World</LOCATION> and its <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Finance Corp.</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. 
<ORGANIZATION>S&amp;P</ORGANIZATION> said it placed a total of about <MONEY>$231 million</MONEY> of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> and the finance unit's debt on its CreditWatch list with negative implications. 
Ratings under study by <ORGANIZATION>S&amp;P</ORGANIZATION> are double-B on <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> senior debt and single-B-plus on subordinated debt of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> and the unit.

   <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said its shareholders approved the company's proposed <MONEY>$960 million</MONEY> recapitalization plan and payment of a special dividend of <MONEY>$26.25</MONEY> a share.

Seeks to Remove

   <PERSON>Martin T. Sosnoff</PERSON>, whose sweetened <MONEY>$32-a-share</MONEY> tender offer for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc.</ORGANIZATION> was rebuffed, said he is soliciting shareholder consent to remove the company's inside directors. 

   In a letter to <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> holders, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> said he is seeking to remove four of the company's nine directors, "leaving in place a truly independent board that can review my amended offer and any other alternatives available to the company." 

   In the letter, the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investor and money manager said that the company's inside directors "have demonstrated that they are not principally motivated by the sincere desire to assure that shareholders receive maximum value for their shares." 

   To succeed, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> needs votes of consent from a majority of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' 30.2 million shares outstanding. 
As the largest shareholder of the hotel and casino operator, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> already owns four million shares, or <PERCENT>13.3%</PERCENT> of the common shares outstanding. 
His latest tender offer expires <DATE>June 19</DATE>. 
In accordance with <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' bylaws, stock of record <DATE>March 27</DATE> is eligible to vote. 

   The directors <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> seeks to remove are <PERSON>Henry Gluck</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer; <PERSON>J. Terrence Lanni</PERSON>, president and chief operating officer; <PERSON>Philip Ball</PERSON>, senior vice president and general counsel; and <PERSON>M. Peter Schweitzer</PERSON>, vice chairman. 

   In <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> had no immediate comment on <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s letter. 

   Earlier this week, in a petition filed with the <ORGANIZATION>New Jersey Casino Control Commission</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> unveiled plans to cut back some of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' operations if his takeover is successful. 

   Among the suggested cuts, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> said he would close <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> corporate headquarters because it is "unnecessary in an industry where operational decision-making occurs on-site." 
He indicated, however, that he would encourage "substantially all of the existing management" to remain with the company. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> also said he possibly would discontinue the company's operations unrelated to its hotel and casino businesses, including investments in retailing and some limited food service operations. 
He said the cuts could save <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> between <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY> and <MONEY>$7 million</MONEY> annually. 

   To counter <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s original <MONEY>$28-a-share</MONEY> takeover bid, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> proposed a recapitalization that included a one-time cash dividend of <MONEY>$25</MONEY> a share and the assumption of about <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> new debt. 

   In rejecting <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s sweetened <MONEY>$932.2 million</MONEY> tender offer bid earlier this month, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> said it might sweeten its recapitalization plan, which some Wall Street traders have valued at <MONEY>$30</MONEY> to <MONEY>$31.50</MONEY> a share. 
In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> closed unchanged yesterday at <MONEY>$32.25</MONEY> a share. 

   Consent solicitations are used infrequently as alternatives to proxy battles. 
Only a few states permit such solicitations, including <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, where Caesars is incorporated. 
The consent process "is an unusual approach with inconsistent results," said <PERSON>John Gavin</PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION>D.F. King &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> proxy solicitation concern. 

   <PERSON>Asher Edelman</PERSON> used a consent solicitation in his successful bid to win control of <ORGANIZATION>Datapoint Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1985</DATE>. 
<PERSON>Joseph A. Frates</PERSON>, an <LOCATION>Oklahoma City</LOCATION> investor, failed in his attempt to get shareholder consent to take control of <ORGANIZATION>Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp.</ORGANIZATION> last year. 
And <PERSON>Irwin Jacobs</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION> investor, also was unsuccessful in using a solicitation in his abortive bid for <ORGANIZATION>Pabst Brewing Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1982</DATE>.

   <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said investor <PERSON>Martin T. Sosnoff</PERSON> missed the deadline to present written consents from shareholders to remove the company's inside directors. 

   As previously reported, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>, who is making a <MONEY>$32-a-share</MONEY> hostile tender offer for the gambling concern, last month began soliciting shareholder consents to remove from <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' nine-member board <PERSON>Henry Gluck</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' chairman and chief executive officer; <PERSON>J. Terrence Lanni</PERSON>, president and chief operating officer; <PERSON>Philip Ball</PERSON>, senior vice president and general counsel; and <PERSON>M. Peter Schweitzer</PERSON>, vice chairman. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> also wanted to amend certain provisions of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' articles of incorporation and bylaws. 

   Under <PERSON>Caesars</PERSON>' bylaws, written consents must be presented by the 60th day following the solicitation. 
The record date for the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investor and money manager's consent solicitation was <DATE>March 27</DATE>; the deadline was <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. 

   Consent solicitations are used infrequently as alternatives to proxy battles, and just a handful of states permit them, including <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, where Caesars is incorporated. 

   Separately, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> said a number of meetings had been scheduled that will relate to the company's petition for approval of a nearly <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> recapitalization plan. 

   The plan, designed to thwart <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s takeover attempt, would require Caesars to incur <MONEY>$960 million</MONEY> of new debt, and would give shareholders a one-time cash dividend of <MONEY>$26.25</MONEY> a share and stock in the reconstituted company. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>New Jersey Casino Control Commission</ORGANIZATION> tentatively scheduled a <DATE>June 16</DATE> special meeting to review the petition. 

   The gaming commission also will review <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s petition for approval of his tender offer. 

   In addition, the <ORGANIZATION>Nevada Gaming Control Board</ORGANIZATION> has tenatively scheduled a <DATE>June 10</DATE> special meeting to review <PERSON>Caesars</PERSON>' proposal to reincorporate in <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION> as part of the recapitalization plan, along with certain aspects of the proposed financing. 

   The board will then forward its recommendations to the <ORGANIZATION>Nevada Gaming Commission</ORGANIZATION>, which is set to review the plan at a <DATE>June 18</DATE> special meeting. 

   Caesars said <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> gaming authorities will review <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s offer concurrently with the company's plan. 

   Caesars cautioned that while it believes it will receive the necessary approvals from <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> gaming authorities, "There can be no assurance that such meetings will take place as scheduled, and the company is unable to predict with certainty when a determination will be made on these matters, or that such approvals will be forthcoming." 

   Caesars shareholders are to vote on the recapitalization plan at a special meeting <DATE>June 12</DATE> here. 
That meeting is unaffected by the scheduling of the meetings with gaming officials, a spokesman for the company said.

   <PERSON>Martin T. Sosnoff</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investor and money manager, said <ORGANIZATION>Pratt Hotel Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Southmark Corp.</ORGANIZATION> dropped their offer to join his <MONEY>$28-a-share</MONEY> bid to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> said his tender offer for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> shares was still in effect. 

   In early March <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> said he made a tender offer to buy the <PERCENT>86.4%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> common shares outstanding that he doesn't already own, in a transaction valued at <MONEY>$725.2 million</MONEY>. 
In mid-March, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION>, the Los Angeles-based owner of casino hotels, rejected <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s bid as inadequate. 
<ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> also sued <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> in federal court in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> to block the tender offer, saying the offer was "illusory" and merely designed to increase the price of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> shares so he can sell his shares at a profit. 

   Last week <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> said he had held discussions with <PERSON>Pratt</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Southmark</ORGANIZATION>, who were interested in joining him in a friendly transaction. 
But in a statement yesterday, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> said <PERSON>Pratt</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Southmark</ORGANIZATION> furnished a notice terminating the talks. 
<PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> said that he hadn't held discussions with the two companies since <DATE>March 20</DATE>, but that under an agreement the Dallas-based companies said they wouldn't make a competing tender offer or bid for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> until they formally terminated their discussions with <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>. 

   In <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Jack E. Pratt Sr.</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Pratt Hotel</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Pratt</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Southmark</ORGANIZATION> ended joint-venture talks with <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> because "both parties couldn't agree to move forward." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Pratt</PERSON> said he couldn't comment on whether <PERSON>Pratt</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Southmark</ORGANIZATION> might make an offer for Caesars themselves or propose another joint venture. 
"We want to expand and we're looking at a number of opportunties, but it would be premature to say what we plan to do," he said. 

   Pratt is a hotel and casino owner, and <ORGANIZATION>Southmark</ORGANIZATION>, which owns <PERCENT>36%</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Pratt</LOCATION>, has interests in real estate and financial services. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> said his tender offer expires <DATE>May 16</DATE> at <TIME>12:01 a.m. EDT</TIME>. 
In <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> declined to comment. 
In composite <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> closed up <MONEY>50 cents</MONEY> at <MONEY>$29</MONEY>.

<HEAD>Trump May Try To Get Control Of Caesars World</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The price of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc.</ORGANIZATION> stock
rose just hours after the company announced that developer <PERSON>Donald
Trump</PERSON> had invested in the gaming company.
   At the close of the day <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> on Wall Street, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION>
stock had jumped <MONEY>$4.12</MONEY>{ a share to <MONEY>$29.37</MONEY>{ in consolidated <ORGANIZATION>New York
Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> trading.
   The activity led at least one gaming analyst to credit <ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION> with
being a shrewd investor.
   ``I take my hat off to <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON>,'' said <PERSON>Marvin Roffman</PERSON> of the
<LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION>Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.</ORGANIZATION> ``It was a
wise investment to buy into <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>. ... We've always felt <PERSON>Caesars</PERSON>
was one of the best-managed companies in the industry, and we felt
it was worth up to <MONEY>$40</MONEY> a share.''
   Trump has asked the federal government for a ruling on whether
his investment would violate antitrust laws. He filed notice with
the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Trade Commission</ORGANIZATION> of his
desire to possibly buy more than <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> common
stock.
   Although neither <ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION> nor <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> will say how much <ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION>
already owns, the filing was made under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act,
which requires companies or individuals to seek such a ruling once
they have acquired at least <MONEY>$15 million</MONEY> worth of stock in a company.
   Caesars World officials refused comment on <ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION>'s notice, ``due
to the confusing content of this notice,'' according to a statement.
Trump also refused to comment <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   ``Such filings are very confidential and he's been advised not to
comment,'' said <PERSON>Susan Heilbron</PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> owns three gaming halls: <ORGANIZATION>Caesars Hotel Casino</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Caesars Palace</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Caesars Tahoe</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>.
   In the notice, <PERSON>Trump</PERSON> said he ``has the good-faith intention,
subject to price, availability and necessary approvals, if any, to
acquire such number of shares ... to hold in excess of <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> of
the outstanding voting securities'' of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Roffman</PERSON> said, however, that <PERSON>Trump</PERSON> would not be successful in a
hostile takeover of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION>. In a similar situation <DATE>last year</DATE>
involving investor <PERSON>Martin Sosnoff</PERSON>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> gaming regulators
blocked <ORGANIZATION>Sosnoff</ORGANIZATION>'s highly leveraged takeover proposal.
   In a similar situation involving <ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>New Jersey's Casino
Control Commission</ORGANIZATION> would probably also reject a highly leveraged
deal, <PERSON>Roffman</PERSON> suggested.
   ``<PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON>'s style is not cash, it's to borrow,'' the analyst
said. ``He has (accumulated) a debt of <MONEY>$1.235 billion</MONEY> outstanding on
his three <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION> properties.''
   Under <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> law, <PERSON>Trump</PERSON> can own only three gaming halls in
the state. So far, he is licensed for two _ Trump Plaza and <ORGANIZATION>Trump
Castle</ORGANIZATION> casino hotels. A third, the massive <ORGANIZATION>Taj Mahal</ORGANIZATION>, is under
construction and expected to be completed in <DATE>1990</DATE>.
   ``I think he'll sell one anyway in the future, because it doesn't
make sense to market three in <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Roffman</PERSON> said. ``But
the bottom line with this Caesars notice is that <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON> is
interested in making money, not owning another casino. He simply
bought into an undervalued situation and will come out with a
profit.''
   This is not the first time that <PERSON>Trump</PERSON> has invested in a rival
casino company.
   He made a <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY> profit from investing in <ORGANIZATION>Holiday Corp.</ORGANIZATION>
stock and a <MONEY>$24 million</MONEY> profit on <ORGANIZATION>Bally Manufacturing Corp.</ORGANIZATION> stock.
He also bought a small amount of stock in <ORGANIZATION>Golden Nugget Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a
move that his competitor, Golden Nugget Chairman <PERSON>Steve Wynn</PERSON>, called
a ``publicity stunt.''

   <PERSON>Martin T. Sosnoff</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investor and money manager, disclosed a bid to acquire the shares of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc.</ORGANIZATION> he doesn't own for <MONEY>$28</MONEY> each, or <MONEY>$725.2 million</MONEY>. 

   Under terms of the offer, which begins today, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> would acquire Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION>, a profitable hotel-casino and real estate concern, through <ORGANIZATION>MTS Acquisition Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a company formed for the proposed purchase. 
The <MONEY>$28-a-share</MONEY> offer is set to expire at <TIME>12:01 a.m. EST</TIME> <DATE>April 4</DATE>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> is <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION>'s largest holder with the equivalent of a <PERCENT>13.6%</PERCENT> stake, or about 4.1 million of the company's 30 million shares outstanding. 
The <MONEY>$28</MONEY> price values all of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> at <MONEY>$840 million</MONEY>. 

   The offer is conditioned on the approval of the <ORGANIZATION>New Jersey Casino Control Commission</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Nevada Gaming Commission</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>State Gaming Control Board of Nevada</ORGANIZATION>. 
Those agencies regulate casinos in those states. 
<PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> also must have sufficient financing before the offer can be completed. 

   In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> closed at <MONEY>$24.25</MONEY> a share, up <MONEY>25 cents</MONEY>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> said in an interview <TIME>last night</TIME> that financing of the offer would be managed by <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Marine Midland Banks Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION> 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> declined to elaborate on why he was bidding for the company, pending a news release, which he said would be issued "shortly." 
He said, however, that he believes that <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION>'s management is "pretty good." 

   In <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the company hadn't been aware of the offer and that it would need time to study it before making a comment. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, has held a stake in <LOCATION>Caesars World</LOCATION> since <DATE>1983</DATE>. 
Last <DATE>September</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> filed for permission under federal antitrust laws to raise his stake in the company to as much as <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> has asked several times for a seat on the board of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION>, a move that the company has rejected. 

   Some industry analysts suggested that <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>, by bidding for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION>, may be hoping to attract the attention of other potential bidders. 

   "<PERSON>Marty</PERSON> has been trying to put the company in play for a long time," said <PERSON>Daniel Lee</PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION> who follows the gaming industry. 
"I'm not sure he's serious." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Lee</PERSON> said that <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> had plenty of opportunities in the past to increase his <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> stake, and had offered to sell stock to <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> real estate developer, and others. 
"Why did he wait until the stock was hitting new highs to make a tender offer? 
It's a little puzzling." 
<PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> couldn't be reached for comment. 

   A source close to <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> said, however, that the offer was a "real" one. 
The source added that "commitments from the bank have been made and <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber</ORGANIZATION> will do the subordinated financing." 
The source said that <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> first retained <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>December 1986</DATE> and that the decision to make a tender offer for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> is one "that he hasn't been planning out for a long time." 

   <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> long has been known as a casino that appeals to high rollers, although it recently embarked on a program to attract middle-income and lower-income players, too. 
Its chairman and chief executive officer, <PERSON>Henry Gluck</PERSON>, is credited with having turned around the company. 

   When <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON> took the helm at <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1983</DATE>, the company posted a loss of more than <MONEY>$21 million</MONEY>. 
For the <DATE>fiscal year ended July 31, 1986</DATE>, the company posted net income of <MONEY>$41 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>$1.36</MONEY> a share, on revenue of <MONEY>$694.4 million</MONEY>. 

   In the <DATE>second quarter ended Jan. 31</DATE>, the company reported net rose <PERCENT>6.8%</PERCENT> to <MONEY>$12.6 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>41 cents</MONEY> a share, from the year-earlier quarter's <MONEY>$7.5 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>25 cents</MONEY> a share. 
Revenue grew <PERCENT>16%</PERCENT> to <MONEY>$190.4 million</MONEY> from <MONEY>$163.8 million</MONEY>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> owns <ORGANIZATION>Caesars Palace</ORGANIZATION>, its flagship hotel-casino in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nev</LOCATION>. 
The company also owns a hotel-casino in <LOCATION>Lake Tahoe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nev.</LOCATION>, and another in <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION> 
The company's holdings also include four honeymoon resorts in the <LOCATION>Poconos</LOCATION> and seven acres of undeveloped land along the <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION> boardwalk. 

   While industry analysts generally have praised <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION>'s financial performance, some have said recently that the stock market long has undervalued the company's stock. 
<PERSON>Mr. Lee</PERSON> said that "<MONEY>$28</MONEY> (a share) is getting pretty close to what Caesars is worth." 

   Besides his <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> holding, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> also has bought large stakes for himself or his firm's clients in recent years in such companies as <ORGANIZATION>Triangle Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Loews Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>New York Times Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
In the past, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> always has been a passive investor, buying and selling for investment rather than takeover purposes. 

   Last year, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> sold a <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> stake in his investment management firm to the public through a <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY> offering of about 1.8 million shares. 
He also sold <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY> of convertible debentures. 
Atalanta/Sosnoff had said it wanted the money to expand and for acquisition of financial companies.

   <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>fiscal second-quarter</DATE> profit rose <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> to <MONEY>$15.7 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>65 cents</MONEY> a share, primarily because of improved operating results at its <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> casino-hotels.

Revenue rose <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> to <MONEY>$421.6 million</MONEY> from <MONEY>$383.3 million</MONEY>. 

   Per-share earnings figures for the latest quarter and six months reflected the company's buy-back of 11 million common shares <DATE>last October</DATE>, which was offset by the conversion of its subordinated debentures into five million common shares. 

   Profit of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' <PERCENT>86.6%</PERCENT>-owned <ORGANIZATION>Caesars New Jersey Inc.</ORGANIZATION> rose <PERCENT>42%</PERCENT> in the latest second quarter to <MONEY>$4.2 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>25 cents</MONEY> a share, from <MONEY>$2.9 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>18 cents</MONEY> a share, a year earlier.

Revenue increased <PERCENT>8.6%</PERCENT> to <MONEY>$160.3 million</MONEY> from <MONEY>$147.6 million</MONEY>. 

   In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> stock fell <MONEY>62.5 cents</MONEY> to close at <MONEY>$24.375</MONEY> a share, but <ORGANIZATION>Caesars New Jersey</ORGANIZATION> stock rose <MONEY>62.5 cents</MONEY> to close at <MONEY>$17</MONEY> a share in <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading. 

   Separately, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> said next month it will introduce its new line of fragrances in all of <ORGANIZATION>Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc.</ORGANIZATION>'s Broadway department stores in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Lazarus</PERSON> department stores in <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>. 
Lazarus is a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Cincinnati-based Federated Department Stores Inc</ORGANIZATION>. Caesars said it expects the fragrances, which had previously been availble at its resorts, to be marketed in about 500 retail outlets throughout the nation by the end of the year. 

   The company also said it signed agreements with <ORGANIZATION>Joan Hansen &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Equity Management Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Palatine</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, both licensing agents, to represent the company in national licensing of apparel, home accessories and gift products under <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> brand labels.

   <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it filed a petition with the <ORGANIZATION>New Jersey Casino Control Commission</ORGANIZATION> for a rehearing on its proposed <MONEY>$960 million</MONEY> recapitalization plan. 

   The commission rejected the hotel and gambling concern's recapitalization plan by a 4-1 vote <DATE>Aug. 12</DATE>. 
One commissioner argued that the plan, which would give <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' shareholders a one-time cash dividend of <MONEY>$26.25</MONEY> a share and stock in the reconstituted company, "lacks any clear business purpose" and is designed to "permanently entrench" current management while loading down the company with <MONEY>$960 million</MONEY> of new debt. 

   Caesars, operator of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars Palace</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nev.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Caesars Atlantic City</LOCATION> hotel-casino in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, said that the timing of the rehearing, which might not be granted by the <ORGANIZATION>Casino Commission</ORGANIZATION>, is uncertain. 

   Caesars said it is asking permission to cross-examine one of the state's witnesses, <PERSON>H. Peter Gray</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Rutgers University</ORGANIZATION>, who testified before the commission that the proposed recapitalization would seriously weaken <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' capital structure. 
Caesars said it is also requesting permission to present testimony of additional independent financial experts. 

   The company added that it is continuing to explore a variety of alternatives to the proposed plan, but added that it hasn't determined which it would pursue should the plan be rejected. 
As previously reported, industry sources have suggested that the company might restructure its recapitalization plan to include less debt. 
Another action suggested by one Wall Street executive would be for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> to sell its <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION> property.

   <PERSON>Martin T. Sosnoff</PERSON>, who waged an unsuccessful takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc.</ORGANIZATION> earlier this year, said he won't sell his roughly <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT> stake back to the company. 

   The <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> financier hadn't previously responded to the Los Angeles-based casino operator's offer, launched this week, to buy <PERCENT>31%</PERCENT> of its shares for <MONEY>$29.50</MONEY> to <MONEY>$34</MONEY> each, or <MONEY>$325 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$374 million</MONEY>. 

   In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> shares closed at <MONEY>$30</MONEY>, up <MONEY>37.5 cents</MONEY>. 

   In a statement, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> branded the buy-back offer a "pusillanimous" effort to "purge" all arbitragers and "other shortterm professional investors from the ranks of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' shareholders." 

   Officials of the hotel and gambling concern declined to comment on <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s announcement. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s response to <LOCATION>Caesars World</LOCATION>'s offer is the latest episode in one of the year's longest-running takeover sagas, which began in <DATE>March</DATE> with <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s unsolicited <MONEY>$28-a-share</MONEY> bid for the company. 
<PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> later raised his proposal to <MONEY>$35</MONEY> a share, or <MONEY>$1.11 billion</MONEY>, for the shares he didn't already own. 

   Caesars World's initial defense against <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> was a proposed <MONEY>$960 million</MONEY> recapitalization plan. 
After <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> regulators refused to approve that plan, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> replaced it with the buy-back offer.

In midday trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> was up <MONEY>$4</MONEY>
a share to <MONEY>$29.25</MONEY>.
   But gaming analysts said <PERSON>Trump</PERSON>, who already owns two casinos in
<LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION> and is building a third, would face regulatory
obstacles to a move on <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> in both <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> is
based, and <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, which prohibits single ownership of no more
than three casinos.
   The Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> owns the highly profitable <ORGANIZATION>Caesars
Hotel Casino</ORGANIZATION> here and the <ORGANIZATION>Caesars Palace</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Caesars Tahoe</ORGANIZATION> casino
hotels in <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>.
   Neither <ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION>'s filing nor <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' statement indicated how much
<ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> stock <ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION> may already own. <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s filing was made under
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, which requires companies or individuals
to seek such a ruling once they have acquired <MONEY>$15 million</MONEY> worth of
stock in a company.
   At <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s closing price of <MONEY>$25.25</MONEY> per share, that would
translate to about 590,000 shares, or about <PERCENT>2.4 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Caesar</ORGANIZATION>'s
24.5 million common shares outstanding.
   <PERSON>Susan Heilbron</PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION>Turmp
Organization</ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON>Trump</PERSON> had no comment on the filing other than to
confirm that it was made. She declined to say how much <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>'
stock, if any, <ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION> already owns.
   According to the <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' statement, <PERSON>Trump</PERSON> indicated he ``has the
good faith intention, subject to price, availability and necessary
approvals, if any,'' to acquire <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Caesar</ORGANIZATION>'s stock.
   Trump's filing also said he ``may decide to seek control of
(<ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>) through the acquisition of <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> (or) more of the
outstanding voting securities.''
   ``Due to the confusing content of this notice, (<ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>) is
unable to ascertain <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON>'s plans at this time and has no
further comment,'' the company said in its release.
   One gaming analyst, <PERSON>Marvin Roffman</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Janney Montgomery Scott
Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, said he doubts that <PERSON>Trump</PERSON> is serious about
making a move to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>, and said any such move would face
serious regulatory opposition in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>.
   ``The gaming board in <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> has come out and said it does not
particularly relish hostile takeovers, and I can tell you that this
would be a hostile takeover because the company will vigorously
defend its independence,'' he said.
   New Jersey gaming regulators have also strongly opposed hostile
takeovers of casino companies.
   Trump now owns <ORGANIZATION>Trump Plaza</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Trump Castle</ORGANIZATION> casino hotels in
<LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION> and is building the massive Taj Mahal casino hotel,
which should be complete in 15 months.

   <PERSON>Martin T. Sosnoff</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investor and money manager, sweetened his hostile offer to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc.</ORGANIZATION> to <MONEY>$32</MONEY> a share, or <MONEY>$931.2 million</MONEY>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>, who is <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION>'s largest holder with a <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT> stake on a fully diluted basis, last month launched a <MONEY>$28-as-hare</MONEY> tender offer for all of the shares outstanding in the Los Angeles-based owner of casino-hotels. 

   According to an advertisement in today's Wall Street Journal, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s amended offer will expire <DATE>June 19</DATE> at <TIME>5 p.m. EDT</TIME>, unless extended. 

   In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> said, "We think our offer is better than the company's because it doesn't put the shareholders at risk and it gives them all cash." 
He added that an attempt by <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> to increase its offer "raises questions about whether the remaining shares of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> would be worth very much after a recapitalization" because the company would be adding more debt. 
<PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> added that "we're still hopeful of getting a friendly deal" with <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION>. 

   But <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> is unlikely to be any more receptive to <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s second offer than it was to his first. 
The latest bid doesn't offer much of a premium to the company's own recapitalization plan announced about a week ago. 
Under that plan, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> would pay a one-time cash dividend of <MONEY>$25</MONEY> a share and incur about <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> of new debt. 

   Current shareholders also would retain common stock in a more highly leveraged Caesars. 
Last week, analysts generally valued the common stock after the recapitalization at about <MONEY>$6</MONEY> to <MONEY>$7</MONEY> a share, although some said the value could be as much as <MONEY>$10</MONEY> a share. 

   The stock market has reacted favorably to the <LOCATION>Caesars World</LOCATION> plan, although in composite trading <DATE>Friday</DATE> on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> common closed at <MONEY>$32.125</MONEY> a share, down <MONEY>12.5 cents</MONEY>. 

   Some traders said <DATE>last week</DATE> that the price of the company's stock was bid up sharply after the company's announcement of its recapitalization plan on expectations that <ORGANIZATION>Southmark Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Pratt Hotel Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, both based in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, might make a joint bid for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION>. 

   As previously reported, <ORGANIZATION>Southmark</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Pratt Hotel</ORGANIZATION> late last month held talks with <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> about conducting a joint offer with the investor for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION>. 
Those talks proved unsuccessful. 

   Terms of <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s latest offer for Caesars World call for purchasing <PERCENT>94%</PERCENT>, on a fully diluted basis, the shares that the investor doesn't already own. 
An individual familiar with <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s latest offer said that the investor anticipates offering securities for the remaining 6.1 million shares with a value of <MONEY>$32</MONEY> a share. 

   The individual said that <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> received written commitments for <MONEY>$475 million</MONEY> from his investment banker, <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> also has received <MONEY>$500 million</MONEY> in commitments from a group of banks led by <ORGANIZATION>Marine Midland Banks Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, and expects an additional <MONEY>$25 million</MONEY> in commitments from those banks. 

   As previously reported, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> had said he was contemplating a new offer for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION>. 
In a letter to <PERSON>Henry Gluck</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> said he was "prepared to offer a meaningful increase in price in the context of a friendly, negotiated transaction."

<TEXT>
   The price of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc.</ORGANIZATION> stock
surged <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> after developer <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON> surprised the gaming
industry by asking the federal government for a ruling on whether he
could buy a controlling interest in the hotel and casino company
without violating antitrust laws.
   Trump filed notice on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> with the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Justice Department</ORGANIZATION>
and the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Trade Commission</ORGANIZATION> of his desire to possibly purchase
more than <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> common stock.
   Although neither <ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION> nor <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> will say how much <ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION>
already owns, the filing was made under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act,
which requires companies or individuals to seek such a ruling once
they have acquired at least <MONEY>$15 million</MONEY> worth of stock in a company.
   The filing was disclosed after the markets closed on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, but
<ORGANIZATION>Caesars Wolrld</ORGANIZATION> stock rose sharply in active trading on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   In consolidated <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> trading, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION>
rose <MONEY>$4.25</MONEY> to <MONEY>$29.50</MONEY> a share. At that price, its 24.5 million shares
are worth about <MONEY>$723 million</MONEY>.
   Caesars World officials refused comment on <ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION>'s notice, which
it disclosed in a statement late <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   The Los Angeles-based company said in the statement that ``due to
the confusing content of this notice, it is unable to ascertain
<ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION>'s plans ...'
   <ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION> also declined comment. ``Such filings are very confidential
and he's been advised not to comment,'' said <PERSON>Susan Heilbron</PERSON>, a
spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> owns three gaming halls: <ORGANIZATION>Caesars Hotel Casino</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Caesars Palace</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Caesars Tahoe</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>.
   In the filing, <PERSON>Trump</PERSON> said he ``has the good faith intention,
subject to price, availability and necessary approvals, if any, to
acquire such number of shares ... to hold in excess of <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> of
the outstanding voting securities'' of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION>.
   But he went on in the filing to say ``it is possible'' that he
may ``decide to seek control'' of Caesars by buying <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> or
more of its stock.
   Gaming analysts spent a good part of <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> pondering Trump's
latest move.
   <PERSON>Marvin Roffman</PERSON> of the investment firm <ORGANIZATION>Janney Montgomery Scott
Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> said <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> is ``one of the best-managed
companies in the industry, and we felt it was worth up to <MONEY>$40</MONEY> a
share.''
   But <PERSON>Roffman</PERSON> said <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> gaming regulators would probably
block any highly-leveraged hostile effort to acquire <LOCATION>Caesars World</LOCATION>.
   ``<PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON>'s style is not cash, it's to borrow,'' <PERSON>Roffman</PERSON>
said.
   Under <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> law, <PERSON>Trump</PERSON> can own only three gaming halls. So
far, he is licensed for two _ Trump Plaza and <ORGANIZATION>Trump Castle</ORGANIZATION> casino
hotels. A third, the massive <ORGANIZATION>Taj Mahal</ORGANIZATION>, is under construction and
expected to be completed in <DATE>1990</DATE>.
   ``I think he'll sell one anyway in the future, because it doesn't
make sense to market three in <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Roffman</PERSON> said. ``But
the bottom line with this Caesars notice is that <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON> is
interested in making money, not owning another casino. He simply
bought into an undervalued situation and will come out with a
profit.''
   This is not the first time that <PERSON>Trump</PERSON> has invested in a rival
casino company.
   He made a <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY> profit in <ORGANIZATION>Holiday Corp.</ORGANIZATION> stock and a <MONEY>$24
million</MONEY> profit on <ORGANIZATION>Bally Manufacturing Corp.</ORGANIZATION> stock. He also purchased
a small amount of stock in the <ORGANIZATION>Golden Nugget Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a move that his
competitor, Golden Nugget chairman <PERSON>Steve Wynn</PERSON>, called a ``publicity
stunt.''

   <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc.</ORGANIZATION> posted a net loss of <MONEY>$4.6 million</MONEY> for its <DATE>fourth quarter ended July 31</DATE>, after a pretax charge of <MONEY>$22.4 million</MONEY> related to its proposed <MONEY>$960 million</MONEY> recapitalization and other efforts to fight off an unwanted takeover. 

   In the <DATE>year-earlier quarter</DATE>, the gambling concern had net income of <MONEY>$14.6 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>48 cents</MONEY> a share. 
Revenue increased <PERCENT>8.9%</PERCENT> to <MONEY>$201.6 million</MONEY> from <MONEY>$185 million</MONEY>. 

   Latest <DATE>fourth-quarter</DATE> operating net, including the <MONEY>$22.4 million</MONEY> pretax charge, was <MONEY>$2.1 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>six cents</MONEY> a share. 
The net loss included an after-tax charge of <MONEY>$6.7 million</MONEY> from the redemption and payment of debt. 
As reported earlier, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> would incur <MONEY>$960 million</MONEY> of new debt under the recapitalization plan, which it designed earlier this year to fight off an unwanted takeover attempt by <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investor <ORGANIZATION>Martin T. Sosnoff</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The recapitalization plan, however, was rejected, 4-1, by the <ORGANIZATION>New Jersey Casino Control Commission</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Aug. 12</DATE>, a move that blocked <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> in proceeding with the proposal. 
The commission tentatively has set <DATE>Sept. 9</DATE> to consider a Caesars petition for a rehearing on the matter. 

   As operator of <LOCATION>Caesars Atlantic City</LOCATION> hotel-casino in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Caesars Palace</ORGANIZATION> hotel-casino in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nev.</LOCATION>, the company needs clearance by gambling authorities in both states to proceed with its recapitalization. 
Nevada officials delayed their decision on the plan after the <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> commission rejected it. 

   In a recent affidavit, the author of a negative study used by the commission in its deliberations indicated that he may soften his objections to the plan. 

   The author, <PERSON>H. Peter Gray</PERSON>, professor emeritus of economics and finance at <ORGANIZATION>Rutgers University</ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> representatives met with him <DATE>Aug. 19</DATE> and provided him with additional information "which I didn't previously have and wasn't aware of, and which, in some instances, was more recent than information which I had relied upon in writing my report." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Gray</PERSON> said he based his first report, cited extensively by the commission in its rejection of the plan, on information from <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> gambling authorities. 

   But securities analysts and others familiar with <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' bid for a recapitalization have expressed doubt that the commission will be swayed in any rehearing. 
Caesars declined to comment on its prospects for a rehearing. 
The company has said it is considering a variety of alternatives, including restructuring the recapitalization plan to include less debt.

   The hotel and gambling concern will use proceeds to fund a portion of as much as <MONEY>$400 million</MONEY> that it may need to buy back the shares and pay related fees and expenses. 
Caesars said it expects to use bank credit facilities and liquidate short-term investments to raise the additional capital. 
<ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION> is sole underwriter for the offering.

It will accept the shares in the order of the prices that holders have specified, within the stated range of <MONEY>$29.50</MONEY> to <MONEY>$34</MONEY> a share, until the total shares tendered reach 11 million.

   <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said its board recommended that shareholders reject <PERSON>Martin T. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s sweetened <MONEY>$32-a-share</MONEY> tender offer for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>, and said it might increase the competing recapitalization plan it proposed earlier this month. 

   The hotel and casino concern, which operates <ORGANIZATION>Caesars Palace</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nev.</LOCATION>, said its recommendation reflects a fairness opinion from its financial advisors and "the lengthy time until shares could be purchased under <ORGANIZATION>Sosnoff</ORGANIZATION>'s offer." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> money manager who is <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>'s largest shareholder with a <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT> stake, set a <DATE>June 19</DATE> expiration date for his <MONEY>$931.2 million</MONEY> tender offer. 
He wasn't immediately available to comment on <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>'s rejection of his amended offer. 

   The recapitalization plan Caesars proposed, two weeks after rejecting <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s initial bid of <MONEY>$28-a-share</MONEY>, or <MONEY>$725.2 million</MONEY>, calls for a one-time cash dividend of <MONEY>$25</MONEY> a share for holders. 
Caesars would incur about <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> of new debt under the plan. 

   Caesars didn't provide additional information about its recapitalization plan but said details of the plan, including its effect on the company's net worth, will be included in proxy materials to be distributed in late <DATE>May</DATE>. 
Caesars has said it would have a negative net worth after the proposed recapitalization. 

   In a statement responding to <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s sweetened offer, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> said its board "would consider appropriate adjustments to the (recapitalization) plan, including the amount of the cash dividend. 

   It said there weren't any assurances the dividend or other terms of the proposed recapitalization would be changed. 
But a spokesman said <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> might decide to increase the <MONEY>$25</MONEY> dividend proposal or otherwise sweeten the recapitalization "in view of the amended Sosnoff offer and the possibility of other developments." 

   In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> shares closed yesterday at <MONEY>$32.25</MONEY>, up <MONEY>12.5 cents</MONEY>. 

   Separately, in a <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> filing this week, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> disclosed a list of prospective investors who have committed to help him finance his proposed acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> by buying preferred shares in the acquired concern. 

   According to the filing, those investors include <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which has agreed to put up <MONEY>$44 million</MONEY> in financing. 
The <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investment bank is also advising <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>. 
Other potential investors include <ORGANIZATION>Shenkman Capital Management Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>T. Rowe Price High Yield Fund Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>M.D.C.

   <PERSON>Martin T. Sosnoff</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investor and money manager, further sweetened his hostile offer to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc.</ORGANIZATION> to <MONEY>$35</MONEY> a share, or <MONEY>$1.11 billion</MONEY>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> in <DATE>March</DATE> launched a <MONEY>$28-a-share</MONEY> tender offer for all the shares outstanding in the Los Angeles-based owner of casino-hotels. 
In <DATE>April</DATE>, after <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> unveiled a recapitalization plan, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> raised his bid for the company to <MONEY>$32</MONEY> a share, or <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> is <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' largest holder, with a <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT> stake in the company on a fully diluted basis. 

   A <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> spokesman declined comment on the sweetened offer. 

   The latest offer, which expires <DATE>June 19</DATE>, differs from earlier ones because shareholders would receive a <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT> stake in the company if it is acquired. 
The new offer tops by a slight margin <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' sweetened recapitalization plan. 
That plan was fashioned to thwart <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s takeover attempt. 

   As previously reported, the recapitalization calls for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> to incur <MONEY>$960 million</MONEY> of new debt. 
It would give shareholders a one-time cash dividend of <MONEY>$26.25</MONEY> a share and stock in the reconstituted company. 
Analysts have valued the stock portion of the offer, or "stub," at about <MONEY>$8.50</MONEY> a share, indicating that the plan has a total market value of <MONEY>$34.75</MONEY> a share. 

   In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> stock closed yesterday at <MONEY>$34.25</MONEY> a share, up <MONEY>25 cents</MONEY>. 

   Terms of <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s latest offer call for the investor to buy <PERCENT>85%</PERCENT>, on a fully diluted basis, of the shares that he doesn't already own. 
For the remainder, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> would offer securities with a value of <MONEY>$35</MONEY> a share. 

   Those securities would consist of preferred stock, valued at <MONEY>$87.8 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>$2.76</MONEY> a share, on a fully diluted basis. 
The plan also calls for <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> to provide stockholders with <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT> of the equity of the acquired company. 
A market source estimates the stub would be worth between <MONEY>$2.50</MONEY> and <MONEY>$2.80</MONEY> a share. 

   As previously reported, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s earlier <MONEY>$32-a-share</MONEY> offer called for the investor to buy <PERCENT>94%</PERCENT> of the shares he doesn't already own on a fully diluted basis, and to offer securities for the remainder. 
That would indicate that the cash portion of the current offer remains about the same as the earlier bid. 

   Caesars World so far has been unreceptive to <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>, refusing to discuss with him his offer for the company. 
<PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>, for his part, has criticized the company's recapitalization plan because it would leave Caesars highly leveraged.

Of Rejection of Its Recapitalization Plan

   <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, reeling from the <ORGANIZATION>New Jersey Casino Control Commission</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> rejection of a proposed <MONEY>$960 million</MONEY> corporate recapitalization, said it is reviewing alternatives that include an appeal or a petition for a rehearing. 

   Meanwhile, the unexpected negative ruling sparked much speculation about what other courses might be open to the gambling concern in its effort to recapitalize. 

   Among the possibilities suggested by industry sources, securities analysts and others is that the operator of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars Palace</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nev.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Caesars Atlantic City</LOCATION> hotel-casino in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> might restructure the recapitalization plan to include less debt. 
That might make the proposal more palatable to the commission, which has the power to issue and revoke gambling licenses in the state. 

   Another, far more serious action suggested by one Wall Street executive would be for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> to sell its <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION> property, with proceeds going into a new recapitalization effort. 
<LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>, Calif.-based <ORGANIZATION>Hilton Hotels Corp.</ORGANIZATION> sold its <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION> hotel to <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON> in <DATE>1985</DATE> after the state commission denied it a gambling license. 
Despite the setback that removed <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> gambling from its plans, <ORGANIZATION>Hilton</ORGANIZATION> has continued to grow in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION> and in its hotel business abroad. 

   One analyst said it is unlikely <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> would pull out of <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION>, given that the <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> operations accounted for <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> of the company's revenue of <MONEY>$694.4 million</MONEY> in the <DATE>fiscal year ended July 31, 1986</DATE>. 
"Why would Caesars want to sell off one of its two good children?" he asked. 

   Trading in <LOCATION>Caesars World</LOCATION> shares was delayed until about <TIME>3 p.m. EDT</TIME> <DATE>yesterday</DATE>, and the stock opened on volume of 400,000 shares, down <MONEY>$5.125</MONEY>. 
The price rebounded slightly during the final hour of <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading to close at <MONEY>$30.50</MONEY>, down <MONEY>$4.625</MONEY>, with about 1.3 million shares changing hands. 

   Caesars declined to elaborate on what alternatives it is considering. 
The company said only that it has 10 days to file a petition for a rehearing and 45 days to file an appeal, and that it will make a decision on the matter within the next week. 

   Caesars' recapitalization plan, which calls for shareholders to receive a one-time cash dividend of <MONEY>$26.25</MONEY> a share and stock in the reconstituted company, was designed to block a takeover attempt by <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investor <ORGANIZATION>Martin T. Sosnoff</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> in <DATE>June</DATE> dropped his sweetened <MONEY>$35-a-share</MONEY> bid for the company, saying he could no longer justify the cost of the <MONEY>$1.11 billion</MONEY> effort. 

   The commission rejected the plan on a 4-1 vote, with one commissioner arguing that the recapitalization "lacks any clear business purpose," and that it is designed to "permanently entrench" current management while loading the company with new debt. 

   In <DATE>April</DATE>, the commission approved a similar <MONEY>$2.6 billion</MONEY> recapitalization proposed by <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Tenn.-based Holiday Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a hotel and gambling concern, after it was rumored to be a takeover target. 
Some gambling industry sources suggested that the commission may have rejected <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' proposal in an attempt to discourage other gambling companies from using recapitalizations to thwart or to discourage takeover attempts. 

   One analyst said the commission's action could make Caesars a takeover target once again. 

   "This (ruling) could raise speculative interest, and someone could make another pass at them because of the commission's misjudgment," said <PERSON>Steven Eisenberg</PERSON>, an analyst with Bear, <ORGANIZATION>Stearns &amp; Co</ORGANIZATION>. Bear <PERSON>Stearns</PERSON> served as an adviser to <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> on the recapitalization plan. 

   Were <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> to make another bid for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>, he would be likely to encounter resistance from <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>'s gaming authorities. 
Commission Chairman <PERSON>Walter N. Read</PERSON> noted in his negative opinion on the recapitalization that <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> "couldn't have taken control of the company" without the commission "finding that he was personally qualified to do so -- which it never has." 
The commission chairman said that under <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s plan, the company wouldn't be financially stable because of the "more than <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> of debt he proposed to load on it." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> hasn't been available for comment since the commission ruling. 

   Nevada gambling authorities, who also have been considering the Caesars recapitalization proposal, said they weren't sure whether they would proceed with a planned <DATE>Aug. 20</DATE> ruling in light of the <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> commission's action. 

   In a related move, <ORGANIZATION>Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.</ORGANIZATION> placed its rating on <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' proposed <MONEY>$330 million</MONEY> issue of senior notes and <MONEY>$330 million</MONEY> of subordinated debentures on CreditWatch with "developing implications," meaning that a raising or lowering of the <ORGANIZATION>S&amp;P</ORGANIZATION> rating could be forthcoming.

Casino Hotel Owner Calls
Plan Better for Holders
Than Bid of $28 a Share

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, responding to a <MONEY>$28-a-share</MONEY> bid by investor <PERSON>Martin Sosnoff</PERSON>, unveiled a recapitalization plan in which it will pay a one-time cash dividend of <MONEY>$25</MONEY> a share and incur about <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> of new debt. 

   The owner of casino hotels said it believes the plan is better for shareholders than <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s tender offer because it will allow holders to retain their shares and "their equity participation in the company's future growth." 

   However, the dividend payment and retirement of <MONEY>$222.5 million</MONEY> of existing debt would wipe out <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>'s shareholders equity and would result in a negative net worth -- or assets minus liabilities -- of about <MONEY>$700 million</MONEY>. 

   Caesars said its investment bankers, <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and Bear, <ORGANIZATION>Stearns &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION> have advised that the company would have sufficient funds for operating cash and capital requirements. 
Caesars also said it expects to continue to receive an unqualified opinion from its outside auditors. 

   After the proposed recapitalization, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> said net income for the fiscal year ending <DATE>July 31, 1988</DATE>, would be about <MONEY>$28.7 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>76 cents</MONEY> a share, based on a projected 37.8 million common shares and equivalent shares outstanding. 
In <DATE>fiscal 1986</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> had net of <MONEY>$41 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>$1.36</MONEY> a share. 
The concern didn't project earnings for the current fiscal year. 

   The plan is subject to approval by shareholders and gambling regulators in <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>. 
Caesars said it will schedule a special shareholder meeting in <DATE>June</DATE> to vote on the recapitalization plan. 
Record and payment dates for the dividend would be set later. 

   Caesars said the <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> in new debt will include <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY> in bank borrowings and <MONEY>$800 million</MONEY> of debt securities to be sold by <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION>. 
The securities are expected to be of the high-yield, low-rated or unrated variety known as junk bonds. 

   Caesars said <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> has advised that "based on customary conditions, it is highly confident that it can arrange the entire financing necessary to consummate the recapitalization." 

   <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION>'s participation in the transaction and its issuance of its usual "highly confident" letter indicates that the firm is continuing its strong presence in the junk bond market despite government investigations into its activities as part of the widening insider-trading probe. 

   In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> described <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>'s offer as "conjectural," in terms of its value. 
"We don't know what the financial terms will be at the point at which <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> raises the capital for the deal," <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> said. 
If, for example, interest rates for the high-yield securities rise 100 basis points in the next three months, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>'s projections of earnings could be slashed by a third, he said. 

   The recapitalization plan also would result in substantial dilution to shareholders, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> contended. 
"A management that owned less than <PERCENT>1%</PERCENT> is suddenly being given a substantially higher stake in the company. 
That can't be good news for existing shareholders," he said. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> said he is beginning talks with new joint venture partners to create a new financial package. 
In any case, his <MONEY>$28-a-share</MONEY> offer for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> "isn't the last word." 
Last week, the investor said <ORGANIZATION>Pratt Hotel Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Southmark Corp.</ORGANIZATION> dropped their offer to join his <MONEY>$28</MONEY> bid to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <PERSON>Henry Gluck</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>, said the recapitalization plan "will not require the sale of assets or the layoff of any employees. 
We are going to have positive earnings from operations." 

   Under the recapitalization, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> shareholders would receive cash later than under <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s offer, and would hold shares in a riskier, debt-laden company. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON> said he believes the plan is "financially superior" to <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s <MONEY>$725.2 million</MONEY> offer and projected that by <DATE>1992</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> would retire <MONEY>$267 million</MONEY> of the new debt and would have net income of <MONEY>$86.2 million</MONEY>. 

   But in an interview yesterday, <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON> declined to predict the market value of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>'s shares after the recapitalization. 
"We won't really know until tomorrow," <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON> said, referring to the opening of trading in <LOCATION>Caesars</LOCATION> today. 
In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> closed <DATE>Friday</DATE> at <MONEY>$29.25</MONEY> a share, up <MONEY>25 cents</MONEY>. 
As of <DATE>Jan. 31</DATE>, the company's equity was <MONEY>$298.8 million</MONEY>. 

   Real estate developer <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON>, who previously forced <ORGANIZATION>Holiday Corp.</ORGANIZATION> into a debt-heavy recapitalization, said that <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>'s plan is "a good deal for stockholders but a bad deal for the company." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON>, who controls four <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, casinos, said he believes that several gambling industry companies have such high debt service costs that they are failing to invest in their primary businesses. 

   Under the plan, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> also would change its state of incorporation to <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and institute certain anti-takeover provisions. 

   Among them would be a so-called "fair price" provision requiring approval by an <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> majority of shares for transactions in which a stockholder has a stake of <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> or more. 
Shares held by the holders of <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> or more wouldn't count toward the <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> requirement. 
Directors, however, could waive the requirement. 

   The move to <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION> incorporation, <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON> said, is motivated partly by a state law there allowing companies to limit the personal liability of directors for damages in potential lawsuits by holders. 

   In addition, the recapitalization would grant 1.5 million common shares to 40 top managers at <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>. 
Ownership rights would vest over a period of eight years. 
And an additional 1.5 million shares would be reserved for future grants to key managers and employees. 

   "The company's management team is facing substantial challenges as we face paying off the approximately <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> of debt which we are incurring in connection with the recapitalization," <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON> said, adding that the share grants are intended to retain managers and provide incentives for them. 

   Caesars said it is likely that the <MONEY>$25</MONEY> dividend would be taxed at ordinary income rates, but only to the extent of the company's total profits <DATE>this year through July 31, 1987</DATE>, which it estimated would be about <MONEY>$7</MONEY> a share. 
The remaining amount of the dividend would reduce a holder's tax basis in the shares and wouldn't be taxable, unless it exceeded the amount of the tax basis, the company said. 
Any excess over the tax basis would be taxed at capital gains rates, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> said. 

   However, <PERSON>Caesars</PERSON> said that the <ORGANIZATION>Internal Revenue Service</ORGANIZATION> might challenge certain aspects of the tax treatment of the recapitalization. 
Caesars also said it doesn't intend to seek a ruling from the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> on tax consequences of the dividend. 

   Caesars said holders who want to assure themselves of capital-gains tax treatment should sell their shares before the recapitalization takes effect. 

   In early <DATE>March</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> launched the <MONEY>$725.2 million</MONEY> tender offer for the <PERCENT>86.4%</PERCENT> of Caesars shares that he doesn't already own. 
Caesars's directors urged holders to reject the offer, which expires 12:01 a.m. EDT on <DATE>May 16</DATE>.

   <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it filed suit in federal court here against <PERSON>Martin T. Sosnoff</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investor who began an unsolicited <MONEY>$28-a-share</MONEY> tender offer for the company last week. 

   The gaming concern alleged in its complaint that <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s offer, valued at <MONEY>$725.2 million</MONEY>, is "illusory" and "designed to manipulate the market" to allow the investor to sell his current Caesars holdings at a substantial profit. 
<PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> holds a <PERCENT>13.6%</PERCENT> stake in <LOCATION>Caesars</LOCATION>, or 4.1 million of the company's 30 million shares outstanding. 

   Caesars also said that certain information about the tender offer in <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> documents filed by <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> is "deliberately false and misleading," including some details of <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s financing plans. 

   The suit, which also names <ORGANIZATION>MTS Acquisition Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the company <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> formed for the acquisition, seeks to enjoin the tender offer and to require <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> to correct all of the allegedly false statements. 

   In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> wasn't available for comment. 

   As previously reported, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> filed suit in a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> court last week against <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>, alleging that the company and its directors breached their fiduciary duty to shareholders by approving anti-takeover measures last year. 
Late last week <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> rejected <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s tender offer as "inadequate" and said it is exploring restructuring or the sale of the company to a friendly suitor. 

   In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> closed at <MONEY>$29.50</MONEY> a share, up <MONEY>12.5 cents</MONEY>.

Have Above-Average Odds for More Profit

   The easy money has already been made in <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION>, traders say. 
But a few speculators are betting on <ORGANIZATION>Resorts International</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Caesars World</LOCATION> and Showboat. 

   Although they've wilted recently, shares of many companies with big stakes in <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION> are at lofty levels. 
That's partly because <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON> last year showed that gambling concerns had valuable assets that weren't reflected in their stock prices. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON>, before gaining control of <ORGANIZATION>Resorts International</ORGANIZATION>, prompted Holiday and <ORGANIZATION>Bally Manufacturing</ORGANIZATION> to boost their stocks by restructuring their operations. 
<ORGANIZATION>Martin Sosnoff</ORGANIZATION>'s bid for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> could have the same result if nobody tops his offer, money managers say. 

   But many casino stocks now reflect their asset values and profit prospects, analysts say. 
The group trades at about 16 times expected <DATE>1987</DATE> earnings, compared with a multiple of 12 or 13 last year, says <PERSON>Steve Eisenberg</PERSON> of Bear Stearns. 
With gambling revenue growing slowly while wagering facilities multiply, <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION> profit could be disappointing for some casinos in <DATE>1987</DATE> and <DATE>1988</DATE>, analysts add. 

   Casino buffs think some stocks have above-average odds. 
Resorts and Showboat are trading far below their asset values. 
Both are scheduled to open new casinos in <DATE>1987</DATE> and should lure novelty-seeking gamblers from <ORGANIZATION>Bally</ORGANIZATION> and other competitors, money managers say. 
Caesars' <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION> operation and its <PERCENT>87%</PERCENT>-owned <ORGANIZATION>Caesars News Jersey</ORGANIZATION> attract upscale gamblers and are expected to do well. 

   Besides their earnings prospects, the stocks are magnets for some rank speculation. 
Some traders hope <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> might eventually take Resorts private, buying the outstanding shares at a big premium. 
<ORGANIZATION>Caesars New Jersey</ORGANIZATION> shares might also be bought if the parent goes private or is acquired, traders add. 
Showboat for two years has been <PERCENT>9.8%</PERCENT>-owned by <ORGANIZATION>Baron Capital</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> money manager, and is considered a potential restructuring candidate. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> says, "I have no interest in buying (the rest of) the Resorts stock." 
Caesars won't comment, saying it's still "looking at the alternatives." 
<PERSON>Ron Baron</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Baron Capital</ORGANIZATION> says, "I don't expect to do anything hostile with a company." 

   Resorts is everybody's favorite. 
Its giant <ORGANIZATION>Taj Mahal</ORGANIZATION> casino, due to open in late <DATE>1987</DATE>, should boost profit significantly, analysts say. 
And <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON>'s fans think he'll move fast to develop Resorts' huge land holdings in <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION>. 

   "Perhaps," says <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON>. 
"The land is just being looked at right now." 

   Speculation that <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> might take Resorts private hinges on a theory that he won't want to share profit from Resorts' developments -- and he won't like public disclosure. 
Developers hate tipping off competitors about details and timing of their plans, says one casino executive. 
But <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> says disclosure "isn't a problem." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> has agreed to pay <MONEY>$101 million</MONEY> for 585,000 Resorts Class B shares with <PERCENT>73%</PERCENT> of the votes, leaving 5.7 million Class A shares outstanding. 
At 58 yesterday, the Class A shares traded at about <PERCENT>58%</PERCENT> of their asset value, analysts say. 
But it would cost Resorts <MONEY>$485 million</MONEY> to redeem the Class A shares at <MONEY>$85</MONEY>, a price traders want. 

   Resorts' main concern is to complete its <MONEY>$525 million</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Taj Mahal</ORGANIZATION>, says <PERSON>Andrew Racz</PERSON>, an investment banker at <ORGANIZATION>Philips</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Appel &amp; Walden</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> doesn't want the Class A shares because they have almost no voting power, adds an industry executive. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> controls four <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION> casinos, one more than allowed by <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> law, including two Resorts' operations and two of his own. 
There's speculation he'll turn Resorts' older casino into a luxury hotel or convention center. 

   Caesars World, at 29 3/8 yesterday, has assets of <MONEY>$30</MONEY> to <MONEY>$35</MONEY> a share, analysts estimate. 
The stock is trading above <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s <MONEY>$28-a-share</MONEY> bid but has been weak recently because of fears he might take "greenmail" for his <PERCENT>13.6%</PERCENT> stake. 
After rebuffing <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> sued the investor <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, saying, among other things, that he earlier expressed interest in selling shares to the company at a premium. 

   "We believe the lawsuit to be without merit," <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> says through a spokesman. 
"I would still like to do a friendly transaction and work with <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> to maximize values for all shareholders." 

   There are about two million <ORGANIZATION>Caesars New Jersey</ORGANIZATION> shares in public hands. 
At 15 7/8 yesterday, they might be bought in at prices "in the low 20s," speculates one holder. 
But the parent might not care to do that. 
It already consolidates <PERCENT>87%</PERCENT> of the subsidiary's profit and, if it wanted, could get <PERCENT>87%</PERCENT> of the cash flow through dividends, accountants say. 

   Showboat, at 28 1/8 yesterday, is "the purest play on <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION>," says <PERSON>Mark Manson</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette</ORGANIZATION>. 
Most casinos pursue big spenders, but <LOCATION>Showboat</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION> site lures "the kind of people who walk the streets of <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION>," says one fan. 

   Its <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION> operation, slated to open soon, could more than double operating profit to <MONEY>$3</MONEY> a share in the year ending <DATE>June 30, 1988</DATE>, says <PERSON>Ron Baron</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Baron Capital</ORGANIZATION>. 
Showboat's assets are worth <MONEY>$40</MONEY> a share, he says, and could be worth much more in the future. 

   But all these stocks are volatile. 
Some of them might languish if <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION> doesn't prosper. 
Says <PERSON>Mike Esposito</PERSON> of Oppenheimer: "Digging for gold has got tougher."

   <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investor <PERSON>Martin T. Sosnoff</PERSON>, who has offered to buy <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc.</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>$28</MONEY> a share, said the company has tried "on several occasions" to buy back his <PERCENT>13.6%</PERCENT> stake in <LOCATION>Caesars World</LOCATION>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> said in a <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> filing that the attempts were made "during the past year." 
He said <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> representatives, including <PERSON>Henry Gluck</PERSON>, chairman, proposed "various forms of consideration" for his stake. 

   He also said in the filing that the company representatives asked him to sign a standstill agreement prohibiting further stock purchases and barring him from taking "any action adverse to incumbent management." 

   The investor, who is chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, said in the filing that he didn't accept any of the company's proposals. 
As previously reported, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> began a tender offer <DATE>Monday</DATE> for the <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> common that he doesn't already own. 
The offer is valued at <MONEY>$725.2 million</MONEY>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> currently owns about 4.1 million of the company's 30 million shares outstanding, making him its largest holder. 

   Caesars, a Los Angeles-based hotel and casino concern, declined to comment on <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s filing. 

   In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION>'s common closed at <MONEY>$27.875</MONEY> a share, down <MONEY>62.5 cents</MONEY>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> didn't say in the filing whether he had been offered cash or securities for his shares. 
He didn't say exactly when the proposals were made, but sources said he was approached a total of three times last <DATE>summer</DATE> and <DATE>fall</DATE>. 

   The sources said <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> was approached twice by <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the investment banking firm that represents <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>. 
"<ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> has been the chief intermediary here," one source said. 
And once, last <DATE>September</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> is understood to have met with <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON>. 
The filing didn't indicate how much <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> was offered for his shares. 

   Separately, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> sued <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> in federal court in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, alleging that its directors failed in their fiduciary duty to holders. 
The suit alleges that certain poison-pill provisions adopted by the company last <DATE>March</DATE> were designed to "discourage investor interest" and to "entrench existing management." 
Caesars declined to comment."

Caesars World's Gluck Keeps Poker Face

   <PERSON>Henry Gluck</PERSON> was in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION> hosting a lavish, televised celebration of the 20th anniversary of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars Palace</ORGANIZATION> hotel-casino last month when he first learned of investor <PERSON>Martin T. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s hostile tender offer for his company. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc.</ORGANIZATION> chairman didn't want to spoil the fun or tip off anyone that there was serious business to deal with. 
So instead of walking off the banquet hall platform to take telephone calls from <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> and Caesars officials, the tuxedo-clad, normally reserved chief executive officer crawled on his hands and knees behind the dais to get to a phone. 
"The people around me must have thought I had a weak bladder," he jokes. 

   Fighting off an unfriendly takeover bid while trying to convince colleagues, customers and shareholders that a company is still alive and well can be a difficult balancing act for a chief executive. 
But <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON> is determined not to let the battle bring <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> to its knees. 

   The effort to maintain a focus on ongoing operations while dealing with the tender offer has been a test of stamina for the 58-year-old <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON>. 
To ward off <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s offer -- initially <MONEY>$28</MONEY> a share, later sweetened to <MONEY>$32</MONEY> a share, or <MONEY>$931.2 million</MONEY> -- Los Angeles-based Caesars unveiled a <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> recapitalization plan that would pay holders a one-time dividend of <MONEY>$25</MONEY> a share and give them stock in the recapitalized company. 

   The plan was announced the day before the heavily publicized middleweight boxing match between Sugar <PERSON>Ray Leonard</PERSON> and <PERSON>Marvin Hagler</PERSON> in the parking lot at <ORGANIZATION>Caesars Palace</ORGANIZATION> -- by far the company's biggest special event of the year. 
The timing may not have been coincidental. 

   "I felt if we had something meaningful to offer shareholders, we should present it when there was more publicity and notoriety about Caesars than any other time," <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON> says. 

   That wasn't an easy task. 
<PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON> had a marathon week leading up to the <DATE>Monday, April 6</DATE>, fight. 
He led a three-day corporate strategic planning meeting, attended the <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION> junk bond conference in <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, and juggled meetings in between with <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' financial advisers. 
(<PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON> also had been scheduled to give a speech at the bond conference, but bowed out because "the company I had planned to talk about might be a different-looking company soon.") 

   To complicate things, <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON> says, he was confronted with "the most unbelievable last-minute logistics for the fight," including a call from a Hollywood executive asking for ringside seats for his studio's 30 biggest stars as part of a promotional campaign. 
Sorry, <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON> responded. 

   The weekend was even more intense. 
<PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON> began it in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> with an all-day meeting with lawyers <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, traveled to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> for an emergency powwow with <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> directors to present the recapitalization plan, did telephone interviews with financial reporters, then flew back to <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION> <DATE>late Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> to do a television interview to promote the Leonard-Hagler match. 

   By then, <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON> had been working nonstop for almost 24 hours, and the fatigue was beginning to show. 
He considered not doing the televison spot, but <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' public relations director convinced <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON> it was important to show he was in command of the situation; the executive was even persuaded to let a celebrity makeup artist hide the circles under his eyes in time for the <TIME>11 p.m.</TIME> news. 

   Working long hours is nothing new for <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON>, who says he's never been able to balance his career with personal pursuits very well. 
"I'm uncomfortable taking a lot of time off work," he says. 

   But <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON> did force himself to take one big chunk of time off during his career. 
He was a millionaire at age 43 when he retired as president of <ORGANIZATION>Monogram Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a Los Angeles-based industrial products conglomerate, in <DATE>1973</DATE>. 
"I'd worked all my life and I'd never stopped to smell the flowers," says <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON>, who began his career holding down jobs as a waiter and launching a small advertising specialty business while he was a student at the <ORGANIZATION>Wharton School</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Pennsylvania</ORGANIZATION>. 

   In the 10 years between <ORGANIZATION>Monogram</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON> says he did almost everything he intended to do when he retired, including learning to ski, improving his tennis game, taking extended vacations to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> with his wife and children, and serving on various educational committees. 
His one regret is that he never finished writing a satirical novel about business, although he still has the manuscript and hopes to complete it someday. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON> initially was seen as an odd choice to head Caesars, although he had been a director of the gambling concern for a year. 
The company was in its worst financial shape ever, and was reeling from bad publicity after its co-founders, brothers <PERSON>Clifford</PERSON> and <PERSON>Stuart Perlman</PERSON>, were found unsuitable to hold a <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> gambling license because of alleged business dealings with associates of organized crime. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON> was approached for the job because of his good reputation in the business community and strong ties with banks and other financial institutions. 
He quickly shook up the company by firing many executives; others quit in protest at what they viewed as <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON>'s meddling. 
The executive also restructured the company's finances. 

   Despite his initial unease about being in the gambling business, <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON> appears to enjoy it thoroughly now. 
For a few hours after the television interview on the eve of the Leonard-Hagler match, and despite his being up for 26 hours, <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON> seemed almost rejuvenated as he strolled the casino floor greeting the high rollers and celebrities in town for the big fight. 

   "The toughest challenge in all of this . . . is to run the company the way it's been running," he says.

   <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said that about 13.7 million common shares were tendered at <MONEY>$29.50</MONEY> each under its previously announced buy-back offer. 

   Caesars' offer to buy back as many as 11 million shares for <MONEY>$29.50</MONEY> to <MONEY>$34</MONEY> each expired yesterday. 
The offer was conducted under a so-called Dutch auction procedure, under which shares tendered are accepted in the order of the prices specified by the holders, within the stated range of <MONEY>$29.50</MONEY> to <MONEY>$34</MONEY> a share. 
The highest price required to reach the 11 million total will be paid to holders of all the shares accepted. 

   Caesars, a hotel and gambling concern, said it will announce the per-share purchase price "as soon as practicable" after the depositary has confirmed the total number of shares tendered and the prices specified by tendering shareholders. 
However, the per-share price probably won't exceed <MONEY>$29.50</MONEY>, since more than the maximum 11 million shares were tendered at that price. 
Of the 13.7 million shares tendered at <MONEY>$29.50</MONEY> each, about 9.6 million were submitted on a guarantee delivery basis, which required delivery of the shares to the depositary by yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> said. 

   In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> closed at <MONEY>$28</MONEY> a share, down <MONEY>$1.50</MONEY>. 
Caesars will have about 24.2 million common shares outstanding after it buys back the 11 million shares. 

   <PERSON>Martin T. Sosnoff</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investor who earlier this year made an unsuccessful takeover bid for the company and retains a <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT> stake, said he didn't tender any shares to <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION>. 
He said he views his holdings as "a good, long-term investment."

   <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc.</ORGANIZATION> expects to report per-share earnings rose more than <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT> in the <DATE>fiscal 1988 first quarter</DATE>. 

   The hotel and casino concern said per-share earnings were <MONEY>85 cents</MONEY> to <MONEY>92 cents</MONEY>, based on about 33 million common shares outstanding. 
In the <DATE>first quarter ended Oct. 31, 1986</DATE>, earnings were <MONEY>50 cents</MONEY> a share, or <MONEY>$15 million</MONEY>, on 30 million shares outstanding. 
Revenue was <MONEY>$198 million</MONEY>. 

   <PERSON>Henry Gluck</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, attributed the record quarterly earnings to strong performances at all of the company's properties. 
The company's flagship <ORGANIZATION>Caesars Palace</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION> did particularly well, he said, while its casinos in <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Lake Tahoe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nev.</LOCATION>, and four honeymoon resorts in the <LOCATION>Poconos</LOCATION> reported improved results "across the board." 

   Costs stemming from an unsolicited takeover bid by the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investor <ORGANIZATION>Martin Sosnoff</ORGANIZATION> in fiscal <DATE>1987</DATE> have mostly been accounted for, <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON> said in an interview. 
Those costs included an unusual pretax charge of <MONEY>$27.7 million</MONEY> for the year ended <DATE>July 31</DATE> and after-tax charges of <MONEY>$6.7 million</MONEY> in the <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE> from the redemption and payment of debt. 

   In the latest quarter, <LOCATION>Caesars World</LOCATION> bought 11 million, or about <PERCENT>31%</PERCENT>, of its shares at <MONEY>$29.50</MONEY> a share in a tender offer prompted by the Sosnoff bid. 
Although earnings for the quarter will reflect changes in the corporate tax rate, results won't include other major extraordinary or unusual items related to the takeover bid or the buyback, <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON> said. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Gluck</PERSON> said it didn't appear that the recent stock market crash would have any immediate impact on the company's businesses. 
He noted that <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION> property continued to lead the city's casinos in gambling winnings in <DATE>October</DATE>, which he attributed in part to the company's strategy of a balanced customer mix in all its casinos. 

   Caesars's retail merchandising activities are expected to double this year, he said. 
Introduction of the company's new fragrances, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars Man</ORGANIZATION> and Caesars Woman, is scheduled for <DATE>December</DATE>.

   <PERSON>Martin T. Sosnoff</PERSON>, facing a showdown in his <MONEY>$1.11 billion</MONEY> offer for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, mounted a mail drive to cancel a <DATE>Friday</DATE> shareholder meeting that could doom his bid. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> money manager, said <PERSON>Caesars</PERSON> had refused his request to postpone the shareholder session until his tender offer expires a week later. 
In a proxy solicitation, he asked holders to support his move to adjourn the meeting for 12 days. 
In case that fails, he also asked holders to vote down a recapitalization plan designed by the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> gambling company to thwart <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>. 

   The two sides have been battling since <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> launched a <MONEY>$28-per-share</MONEY>, or <MONEY>$725.2 million</MONEY>, tender offer for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>March</DATE>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> is <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' largest holder, with a <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT> stake in the company on a fully diluted basis. 

   In <DATE>April</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> countered with a plan to give holders a one-time <MONEY>$26.25-a-share</MONEY> cash dividend and leave them with shares valued at an estimated <MONEY>$8.50</MONEY> each. 
The plan would encumber Caesars with nearly <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> in debt. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> then raised his offer to <MONEY>$32</MONEY> a share in mid-April, and again to <MONEY>$35</MONEY> a share last week. 

   In <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> spokesman declined to comment on <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s new proxy solicitation. 
He said the meeting for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> holders to vote on the recapitalization is still set for <DATE>Friday</DATE>. 

   At that meeting, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> will also ask holders to approve a series of new anti-takeover measures. 
Even if <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' recapitalization plan isn't approved, the anti-takeover measures could effectively derail <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s tender offer. 

   A motion to adjourn the shareholder meeting requires majority approval by those holders attending the meeting. 
Caesars' proposed recapitalization plan requires approval by holders of a majority of the company's shares outstanding. 

   The anti-takeover measures holders will consider at <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s meeting include amendments to the company's articles of incorporation providing that certain transactions with holders of <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> or more of Caesars stock, changes in the company's bylaws, and attempts to remove directors from office be approved by <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> of the shareholders. 

   The company also is proposing to stagger its directors' terms of office, to reincorporate in <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, to indemnify officers and directors, and to provide increased employment and performance incentives for management. 

   In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> shares closed at <MONEY>$34.75</MONEY>, up <MONEY>12.5 cents</MONEY>.

The <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investor has held as much as <PERCENT>16%</PERCENT> of the hotel and casino company. 

   In a <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> filing, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> said he sold 301,900 <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> common shares <DATE>Monday</DATE> for <MONEY>$13.50</MONEY> to <MONEY>$14.50</MONEY> each. 
After the sales, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> held 1,072,900 Caesars common shares, the filing said.

<PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> couldn't be reached.

   A federal judge here derailed <ORGANIZATION>Martin T. Sosnoff</ORGANIZATION>'s <MONEY>$35-a-share</MONEY> takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in a ruling that would require the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investor to start his tender offer over. 

   <PERSON>Judge William Rea</PERSON> late yesterday also ordered Caesars to delay for at least one month a vote on its proposed <MONEY>$960 million</MONEY> recapitalization plan, which the company designed to thwart <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s efforts. 

   Caesars said it postponed a <DATE>Friday</DATE> meeting at which shareholders were to have voted on the recapitalization plan. 

   The judge's ruling enjoins <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> from continuing his tender offer on the ground that his financing plan violates a rule by the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve Board</ORGANIZATION> that a purchaser may not borrow more than <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> of the funds used to purchase stock of a target company if that stock is to be pledged as security to the lender. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> said he intends to appeal the judge's decision immediately. 
"I think this decision is absolutely erroneous. 
There is no precedent to support it," he said. 
He said he expects to recommence his tender offer within 30 days. 
Caesars said it is reviewing the ruling and declined further comment. 

   As previously reported, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> had received commitments from <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc.</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>$475 million</MONEY> in financing, to be offered as "exchangeable preferred stock," and <MONEY>$500 million</MONEY> in loans from a group of banks led by <ORGANIZATION>Marine Midland Bank</ORGANIZATION>. 
In his opinion, <PERSON>Judge Rea</PERSON> described the <MONEY>$475 million</MONEY> of exchangeable preferred stock as "debt instruments" rather than equity, since the stock would most likely be exchanged for notes upon <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s successful completion of the tender offer. 
According to the rules of the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve Board</ORGANIZATION>, the <MONEY>$475 million</MONEY> of securities would be considered secured by Caesars stock, the judge added. 

   The injunction would allow <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> to begin a new tender offer, provided that he discloses information about his personal finances, spells out in proxy materials his probable intention to use <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' available cash to repay the debt for the acquisition and to sell off certain of the company's assets, including its <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> corporate headquarters and its <LOCATION>Lake Tahoe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nev.</LOCATION>, facility. 
<PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> also would be required to disclose that regulatory approvals could delay his acquisition of the company as much six months. 

   <PERSON>Judge Rea</PERSON>'s order calls for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> to circulate a disclaimer to statements it made in proxy materials that "the plan of recapitalization doesn't preclude a third party, including <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>, from making a more attractive offer to the company's holders, either before or after the recapitalization is effected." 
Caesars also would be required to circulate to holders two memoranda from its investment banker, <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, about the financial effects of the recapitalization. 
The injunction prevents <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> from holding a shareholder vote on the plan until 30 days after the disclaimer and memoranda have been circulated. 

   As previously reported, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> last week mounted a mail drive to adjourn the meeting until after the <DATE>June 19</DATE> expiration of his <MONEY>$1.11 billion</MONEY> tender offer, which he had sweetened earlier in the week from the previous <MONEY>$32</MONEY> a share. 
Caesars directors rejected the sweetened offer and recommended that shareholders adopt the recapitalization plan. 

   Caesars' recapitalization plan would give shareholders a one-time cash dividend of <MONEY>$26.25</MONEY> a share and stock in the reconstituted company. 
Analysts last week valued the stock portion of the plan, or "stub," at about <MONEY>$8.50</MONEY> a share, indicating a total market value of <MONEY>$34.75</MONEY>. 
But <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> has valued the recapitalization plan at <MONEY>$35</MONEY> a share. 

   The judge's ruling was issued after the markets closed yesterday. 
In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> common shares fell <MONEY>12.5 cents</MONEY>, to close at <MONEY>$34.625</MONEY>. 

   In supplemental proxy material mailed to shareholders <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> said it might change its proposed financing for the recapitalization by obtaining a senior floating-rate loan of about <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> from "certain non-United States financial institutions" that it wouldn't identify. 
The company said that if it obtains the loan, it would reduce a planned offering of senior notes to <MONEY>$330 million</MONEY> from <MONEY>$430 million</MONEY>.

   <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said its board "vigorously opposes" <PERSON>Martin T. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s solicitation of holder consent to remove four inside directors. 

   Separately, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> plans to build a <MONEY>$150 million</MONEY> shopping complex at its <ORGANIZATION>Caesars Palace</ORGANIZATION> hotel-casino in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nev</LOCATION>. 

   In a letter to holders, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Henry Gluck</PERSON> and President <PERSON>J. Terrence Lanni</PERSON> said the board believes that "<PERSON>Mr. 
Sosnoff</PERSON>'s ultimate objective is to buy the company as cheaply as possible. 
In furtherance of this goal, we believe that <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s 'consent' proxy fight is intended primarily to cause uncertainty and chaos among our shareholders." 

   Last week, the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investor said in a letter to holders that he seeks to remove from <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>'s nine-member board Messrs. 
<PERSON>Gluck</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lanni</PERSON>; <PERSON>Philip Ball</PERSON>, senior vice president and general counsel; and <PERSON>M. Peter Schweitzer</PERSON>, vice chairman. 

   As reported previously, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> is waging a <MONEY>$32-a-share</MONEY>, or <MONEY>$931.2 million</MONEY>, takeover battle for the operator of casino-hotels. 
To fend off his advances, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> earlier this month unveiled a recapitalization plan that offers holders <MONEY>$25</MONEY> a share and stock in a more highly leveraged Caesars. 
Caesars said it would incur about <MONEY>$950 million</MONEY> of new debt under the recapitalization. 

   In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>'s shares fell <MONEY>25 cents</MONEY>, to <MONEY>$31.125</MONEY>. 

   The cost of the <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION> project will be borne by <ORGANIZATION>Gordon Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, a developer of retail properties, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> said. 
Gordon will operate the facility and lease the property from <ORGANIZATION>Caesars Palace</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The complex, which will have a Roman theme, will include 875,000 square feet of retail space, parking facilities for more than 3,000 cars, and a 1 1/2-acre open-air "Roman village bazaar," <PERSON>Caesars</PERSON> said. 
The first phase of the shopping complex is scheduled for completion in <DATE>August 1990</DATE>. 

   As part of the new development, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> said it plans its own additional <MONEY>$25 million</MONEY> expansion to add 25,000 square feet of casino space, a 125-seat restaurant and various food and beverage outlets. 
Caesars will finance that expansion and expects to complete it in early <DATE>1989</DATE>.

   Stock market traders and analysts are giving a higher value to <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc.</ORGANIZATION>'s recapitalization plan, unveiled over the weekend, than to a hostile, <MONEY>$28-a-share</MONEY>, offer from investor <ORGANIZATION>Martin Sosnoff</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Caesars proposed to pay holders a one-time, <MONEY>$25-a-share</MONEY> cash dividend and incur about <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> of new debt. 
Holders would retain equity in a more highly leveraged <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>, a Los Angeles-based owner of casino hotels. 
Analysts and investment bankers placed the value of the equity at between <MONEY>$6</MONEY> and <MONEY>$7</MONEY> a share. 

   Takeover speculators yesterday pumped up <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> stock price well above <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s offer for the company, indicating that the market believes the casino company's complex recapitalization plan is considerably richer than <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s bid. 
Caesars closed yesterday at <MONEY>$30.625</MONEY>, up <MONEY>$1.375</MONEY>, in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading. 

   Traders said the closing price also reflected a roughly <MONEY>$1</MONEY> discount to take into account the transaction's uncertainty and time lag, and a roughly 50-cent bonus to reflect the possibility of a higher bid from <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investor and money manager who has several times sought a seat on the <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> board, last month launched a <MONEY>$725.2 million</MONEY> tender offer for the <PERCENT>86.4%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> shares that he doesn't already own. 

   As reported earlier, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> has said he is contemplating a new offer for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>. 
In a letter <DATE>last Friday</DATE> to <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Henry Gluck</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> said he was "prepared to offer a meaningful increase in price in the context of a friendly, negotiated transaction." 
Takeover bidders often hold out the possibility of a higher bid in return for a chance to inspect the target company's books. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> didn't have any additional comment yesterday. 

   Should <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> come back with another offer, "he's going to have to make it very sweet," said <PERSON>Marvin Roffman</PERSON>, an industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Roffman</PERSON> said he regarded <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' 76-cents-a-share earnings estimate for its fiscal <DATE>1988</DATE> as based on conservative assumptions. 
Caesars' fiscal year ends <DATE>July 31</DATE>. 

   Analysts said that on the negative side, the Caesars proposal would sharply increase the company's leverage. 
The value of the plan could also decrease if interest rates rise before the end of the <DATE>summer</DATE>, when analysts expect the plan to receive regulatory approval. 
However, analysts asserted that the company had strong cash flow to pay down its debt and wouldn't have to sell any assets to fend off <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s bid. 

   The value of the <MONEY>$25</MONEY> dividend would be reduced somewhat by taxes, analysts said. 
<PERSON>Mark K. Manson</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> said taxes and other considerations would reduce the dividend by about <MONEY>$1.50</MONEY>. 

   Caesars' <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> in new debt would include <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY> in bank borrowings and <MONEY>$800 million</MONEY> of junk bonds, or high-yield debt securities, to be sold by <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 

   <PERSON>Gary Yalen</PERSON>, chief investment officer of <ORGANIZATION>Irving Trust Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a large New York-based institutional holder in <LOCATION>Caesars</LOCATION>, said the high leverage could make <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' results "volatile and hard to predict." 
However, he said that "if management's earnings estimate is good . . . (the Caesars proposal is worth) more than the previous offer." 

   The heavy debt burden doesn't concern <PERSON>Dennis Forst</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Seidler Amdec Securities Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. 
"They were heavily leveraged five years ago and their strong cash flow was able to alleviate that. 
I'm comfortable that they'll be able to work down the (proposed) leverage over time."

<HL> Sosnoff Drops Bid as Too Costly,
Clears Way for $960 Million Revamping

   <PERSON>Martin T. Sosnoff</PERSON> said he discontinued his <MONEY>$35-a-share</MONEY> hostile takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, clearing the way for <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' <MONEY>$960 million</MONEY> recapitalization plan. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investor and money manager, said he could no longer justify the cost to himself and the company of continuing his <MONEY>$1.11 billion</MONEY> takeover effort. 
<PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> is <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' largest holder, with a <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT> stake in the company on a fully diluted basis. 

   Last week a federal judge in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> enjoined <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> from continuing his tender offer on grounds that it violated a <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve Board</ORGANIZATION> rule governing the financing of corporate takeovers. 
The injunction would have allowed <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> to begin a new tender offer, provided he disclosed certain information about his personal finances and intentions for the company. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> said that since making his tender offer for the Los Angeles-based owner of casino-hotels, he has incurred about <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY> in "potential obligations." 
He added, "I have reluctantly concluded that the cost of continuing the tender offer is too high." 

   Some industry analysts said they doubt <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s estimate that his costs from the offer could approach <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY>. 
"That figure sounds awfully high to me," said <PERSON>Marvin B. Roffman</PERSON>, a securities analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>. 
"I'd like to see a breakdown." 

   A spokesman for <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> said simply, "His expenses are what his expenses are." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Roffman</PERSON> said that <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> "certainly must be thrilled" with the increase in Caesars stock price during the past three months. 
The market value of <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s 4.2 million <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> common shares and common share equivalents has increased to about <MONEY>$142.3 million</MONEY> from about <MONEY>$102.9 million</MONEY> on <DATE>March 6</DATE> -- the last trading date prior to <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>'s offer -- when the shares closed at <MONEY>$24.50</MONEY>. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> shares closed at <MONEY>$33.875</MONEY> a share, down <MONEY>37.5 cents</MONEY>. 

   In conceding that the company's share price has risen because of his tender offer, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> said that on an after-tax basis his efforts "have produced virtually no financial gain for myself." 
He added, "I want to make it clear that I will not countenance being classed as a corporate raider." 

   Caesars said it is "pleased to be moving forward" with its recapitalization plan. 
Under the plan, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> would give shareholders a one-time cash dividend of <MONEY>$26.25</MONEY> a share and stock in the reconstituted company. 
Analysts have valued the stock portion of the plan, or "stub," at about <MONEY>$8.50</MONEY> a share, indicating a total market value of <MONEY>$34.75</MONEY>. 
Caesars has valued its plan at <MONEY>$35</MONEY> a share. 
The company said a special shareholders meeting to vote on the arrangement and on the special cash dividend is scheduled for <DATE>July 8</DATE>. 

   In <DATE>March</DATE> <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> launched a <MONEY>$28-a-share</MONEY> tender offer for all shares outstanding of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>, which operates <ORGANIZATION>Caesars Palace</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nev.</LOCATION>, among other properties. 
After Caesars unveiled its recapitalization plan, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> raised his bid for the company to <MONEY>$32</MONEY> a share. 
Caesars later increased the dividend portion of its recapitalization plan to <MONEY>$26.25</MONEY> a share from <MONEY>$25</MONEY> a share, and <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> sweetened his tender offer to <MONEY>$35</MONEY> a share. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Roffman</PERSON>, the analyst, said he isn't surprised that <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> is continuing with the recapitalization, because it would significantly reduce the company's vulnerability to future takeover attempts. 
"If it isn't <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON>, it could be someone else," he said. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Roffman</PERSON> said that while the recapitalization plan would leave Caesars "very leveraged," the company's plan is "the lesser of two evils." 
Caesars plans to issue <MONEY>$330 million</MONEY> of senior notes and <MONEY>$330 million</MONEY> of subordinated debentures, borrow <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY> from a syndicate of banks and obtain a <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> senior floating rate loan from "certain non-United States financial institutions" to finance the recapitalization. 

   In a parting shot, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> criticized the listing for "when issued" trading in <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' stub equity security on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>. 
He said it didn't provide "a reliable guide for comparing my tender offer to management's recapitalization plan." 

   He said the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> should consider in future takover battles whether to list "such nebulous securities as 'when issued' equity stubs." 

   Yesterday, a spokewoman for the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> said there is nothing wrong with the exchange's listing practices.

   Caesars World Inc., buoyed by healthy results at its
Atlantic City, N.J., casino, posted a 63% increase in net
income for its fiscal first quarter.
   The Los Angeles-based casino operator reported net of
$22.9 million, or 95 cents a share, for the quarter ended
Oct. 31, compared with earnings of $14 million, or 60 cents a
share, a year earlier. Revenue was essentially flat at $233.1
million, compared with $235.6 million a year ago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Henry Gluck</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive, said the <LOCATION>New
Jersey</LOCATION> property's operating results more than doubled,
boosted by higher table-game win percentages, a <PERCENT>16%</PERCENT> rise in
slot revenue and lower expenses stemming from its
cost-control program. "The improvement was pretty much across
the board," he said.
   At <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> resorts, operating profit at <LOCATION>Lake Tahoe</LOCATION>
fell because of lower table-game win percentages and a drop
in table activity. That offset operating gains at <ORGANIZATION>Caesars
Palace</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>, which also had a drop in table activity.
The <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION> resort benefited from higher slot activity and
improved debt collection.
   The earnings sharply exceeded Wall Street's expectations.
Caesars' stock was quoted at <MONEY>$31.25</MONEY>, down <MONEY>$1.25</MONEY>, in late
trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, which analysts
attributed to the unsettled market.

   55% Earnings Decline

   LOS ANGELES -- Caesars World Inc. reported that earnings
for its fourth quarter ended July 31 fell 55% to $7.4
million, or 31 cents a share, from $16.4 million, or 66 cents
a share, a year earlier.
   Most of the decline came from Caesar's Nevada hotel/casino
operations, particularly from low table-game win percentages
at Caesars Tahoe. In Las Vegas, a decrease in wagering
activity at Caesars Palace was partially offset by a higher
win percentage by the company over the same period a year
ago.

<TEXT>
   Revenue fell <PERCENT>5.1%</PERCENT> to <MONEY>$223.7 million</MONEY> from <MONEY>$235.7 million</MONEY>.
   Although <PERSON>Caesars</PERSON>' results were about what analysts
expected, the company's stock fell <MONEY>$1.875</MONEY> a share to <MONEY>$11.875</MONEY>
in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday.
   The drop may reflect "growing nervousness over what the
problems in the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> and higher oil prices could do to
the travel business," said <PERSON>Lee Isgur</PERSON>, an analyst at
<ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   But <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> has had other problems. Competition from new
casinos in both <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, has hurt
its business for the past few quarters. Caesars has also
blamed higher provisions for bad debts, as well as increased
casino payroll and operating costs related to completing a
two-year renovation and expansion program.
   For the full year, net declined <PERCENT>45%</PERCENT> to <MONEY>$36.8 million</MONEY>, or
<MONEY>$1.52</MONEY> a share, compared with <MONEY>$66.9 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>$2.72</MONEY> a share,
a year earlier. Revenue fell <PERCENT>3.5%</PERCENT> to <MONEY>$870.2 million</MONEY> from <MONEY>$902
million</MONEY>.
   Caesars said it bought back about 1.2 million of its
common shares during fiscal <DATE>1990</DATE>, reducing the number of
shares currently outstanding to about 24 million. During the
year, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> said it also bought back <MONEY>$19.8 million</MONEY> of its
<PERCENT>13.5%</PERCENT> notes due in <DATE>1997</DATE>.

   <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION> stands to receive about <MONEY>$36.6 million</MONEY> upon successful completion of a nearly <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> recapitalization of <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 

   But <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham</ORGANIZATION> "may have actual or potential conflicts of interest" from its role as both the financial adviser and financing agent for the recapitalization plan, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> said in a proxy statement. 

   Caesars said <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham</ORGANIZATION> issued fairness opinions on both a hostile tender offer by <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investor <PERSON>Martin T. Sosnoff</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION>' subsequent recapitalization plan, which <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham</ORGANIZATION> will help finance. 
The investment banker said the Sosnoff offer is inadequate but that the company's recapitalization plan is fair. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham</ORGANIZATION> couldn't be reached for comment. 

   Under the recapitalization plan, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> shareholders would receive a one-time cash dividend of <MONEY>$26.25</MONEY> a share and would retain stock in the company. 
The gambling concern would incur <MONEY>$960 million</MONEY> of new debt to finance the plan, issuing <MONEY>$430 million</MONEY> of senior notes and <MONEY>$330 million</MONEY> of subordinated debentures -- both underwritten by <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham</ORGANIZATION> -- and borrowing about <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY> from a syndicate of banks. 

   Caesars said that upon completion of the recapitalization, <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> would receive total fees of about <MONEY>$9.7 million</MONEY> for its role as the investment adviser, about <MONEY>$25.3 million</MONEY> as sole underwriter of the note and debenture offerings, and about <MONEY>$1.6 million</MONEY> as the agent for the bank financing. 

   Bear, <ORGANIZATION>Stearns &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> also retained to issue fairness opinions on the recapitalization plan, will receive total fees of about <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY>, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> said. 
Those fees aren't contingent upon successful completion of the recapitalization plan, however. 

   Caesars also said it agreed to indemnify both <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Bear Stearns</PERSON> against "certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws." 
The recapitalization would leave Caesars with total long-term debt of about <MONEY>$1.05 billion</MONEY>, including obligations under capital leases and current maturities, and a negative net worth -- or assets minus liabilities -- of about <MONEY>$508.8 million</MONEY>, based on projections for <DATE>July 31</DATE>, the end of the current fiscal year. 

   Given the effect of the recapitalization, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> said it projects <DATE>1988</DATE> net income of <MONEY>$20.5 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>54 cents</MONEY> a share, on revenue of <MONEY>$821.8 million</MONEY>. 
The company didn't estimate fiscal <DATE>1987</DATE> results, but in <DATE>fiscal 1986</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> had net income of <MONEY>$41 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>$1.36</MONEY> a share, on revenue of <MONEY>$694.4 million</MONEY>. 

   Shareholders are to vote on the recapitalization plan <DATE>June 12</DATE> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. 
As reported previously, <PERSON>Mr. Sosnoff</PERSON> has set a <DATE>June 19</DATE> expiration date for his <MONEY>$32-a-share</MONEY>, or <MONEY>$931.2 million</MONEY>, tender offer.
