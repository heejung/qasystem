<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>'s joint celebration <DATE>Monday</DATE> of the
birthdays of two Confederate generals and a black civil rights
leader on Lee-Jackson-King Day is ``the perfect combination of
diversity,'' says the man responsible for the merger.
   Lt. Gov. <PERSON>L. Douglas Wilder</PERSON>, who as a state senator five years ago
pushed through the bill making <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Day a <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>
holiday, says he doesn't find it ironic that King shares the holiday
with <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> natives <PERSON>Robert E. Lee</PERSON> and <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> ``Stonewall'' <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>.
   ``I find no irony in it at all,'' <PERSON>Wilder</PERSON>, a grandson of slaves
and the first black elected to statewide office in the South since
Reconstruction, said <DATE>Friday</DATE>. ``It shows we are prepared to recognize
good men. Men of principle have differed on principle and I think
all three were men of principle.''
   <PERSON>James Farmer</PERSON>, a civil rights leader who worked with <PERSON>King</PERSON>, said
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> that <PERSON>King</PERSON> deserves a day all his own because ``<PERSON>Martin
Luther King</PERSON> stood alone as a giant.''
   But he said <PERSON>King</PERSON> would have been amused at being linked with
heroes of the Confederacy.
   ``<PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON> was very tolerant of things like that,'' Farmer said.
``If he is looking down from heaven now I can hear him laughing.''
   The bill passed the state legislature in <DATE>1984</DATE> after seven years
of effort by <PERSON>Wilder</PERSON> and often acrimonious debate in public hearings.
   Opponents objected to honoring a non-Virginian with a holiday
when favorite sons such as <PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Patrick Henry</PERSON> did
not have their own days. Celebrating <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s birthday on the third
<DATE>Monday</DATE> in <DATE>January</DATE>, already designated as Lee-Jackson Day, also drew
protest.
   King's birthday is <DATE>Jan. 15, 1929</DATE>. Lee was born <DATE>Jan. 19, 1807</DATE> and
<PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> was born <DATE>Jan. 21, 1824</DATE>.
   ``The memory of Lee and <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> is sacred to the hearts of all
true Virginians. To replace our heroes with <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON> or
any other non-Virginian is to betray the greatness of our heritage
as a commonwealth,'' Forest <PERSON>Tucker</PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Sons of
Confederate Veterans</ORGANIZATION>, said in <DATE>1984</DATE>.
   But <PERSON>Wilder</PERSON> persisted. ``I have never taken to the floor of the
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> to say one word against <PERSON>Stonewall Jackson</PERSON>,'' he told his
fellow legislators five years ago. ``I have never failed to stand in
honor of <PERSON>Robert E. Lee</PERSON>. But that cause which is sacred to many
Virginians is not sacred to all Virginians.''
   <PERSON>Wilder</PERSON>, who is expected to announce his candidacy for governor
this month, now minimizes the controversy over the bill, pointing
instead to ceremonies around the state honoring King. In <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>,
for example, a week of activities is being devoted in memory of the
slain civil rights leader, including forums, worship services and a
touring stage show performing works by black writers.
   <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Day is a state holiday in all states
except <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>. Mississippians honor both <PERSON>Lee</PERSON>'s and <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s birthdays on the
same day.
   <PERSON>Charles Sadler</PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Federal
Holiday Commission</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, said his group doesn't mind
how <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s birthday is celebrated, as long as it is. A joint holiday
is ``better than nothing,'' he said.

   Ringing bells and ringing speeches commemorated the legacy of the
Rev. <PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON> amid renewed calls to strive for the
goals of the slain civil rights leader.
   Marchers filled city streets in <LOCATION>San Franciso</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Liberty Bell</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> was symbolically tapped, and national leaders descended
on <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s hometown to join his family in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> on the federal day
marking his 60th birthday.
   ``He lived a hero's life. He dreamed a hero's dreams,''
President-elect <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> told black leaders in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. ``He left a
hero's indelible mark on the mind and imagination of a great
nation.''
   A unity march across the <ORGANIZATION>University of Michigan</ORGANIZATION> campus in <PERSON>Ann
Arbor</PERSON> drew about 2,000 people, who paraded as the university's
carillon played ``We Shall Overcome,'' the anthem of the civil
rights movement.
   Later <DATE>Monday</DATE>, <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>Andrew Young</PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION>University of
Michigan</ORGANIZATION> audience that, ``The world King left is not a great deal
different.''
   ``But there seems to be an awareness that violence is not the
solution to the world's problems, as we learned in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, as the
Russians have learned in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>, and as the <ORGANIZATION>PLO</ORGANIZATION> has learned.''
   Nowhere was <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s influence felt more strongly than in <LOCATION>Selma</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>, where he began the <DATE>1965</DATE> Selma-to-Montgomery march that helped
establish voting rights for blacks throughout the South.
   On <DATE>Monday</DATE>, three blacks were sworn in as members of the <ORGANIZATION>Dallas
County Commission</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Selma</LOCATION>. They became the first black <LOCATION>Dallas
County</LOCATION> commissioners since Reconstruction and gave the five-member
commission a black majority.
   ``We bring home to <LOCATION>Dallas County</LOCATION> the harvest of the <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther
King</ORGANIZATION> voting rights act,'' said <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge U. W. Clemon</PERSON>, the
first black federal judge in <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, who administered the oath of
office.
   King's widow, <PERSON>Corretta Scott King</PERSON>, was joined by black and white
political leaders for the annual ecumenical service at the <ORGANIZATION>Ebenezer
Baptist Church</ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON>King</PERSON> and his father preached.
   The Rev. <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON>, once one of <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s young lieutenants,
used the occasion to criticize the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration's civil
rights record and President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s suggestion that civil rights
leaders bolster their position by fostering an attitude of
oppression among blacks.
   Jackson called <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s statements ``petty comments from the same
man who implied that <PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON> was a communist.''
   In <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Ambassador <PERSON>Edward Perkins</PERSON>, who is
black, marked the holiday by unveiling a bronze bust of King that
will sit in a new <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> embassay compound. The ceremony included
blacks and whites who have been prominent critics of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s
system of racial separation.
   In the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, parades were held in places like <LOCATION>New
Orleans</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION>, where 15,000 people
marching from four directions converged on <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>.
Plaza.
   ``I took part because <PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON>'s dream has not been fully
realized,'' said <PERSON>Elbert Winbush</PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, who joined
10,000 others in the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> parade with his three daughters.
   King would have been 60 on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. He was 39 years old when he
was shot to death by a sniper in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, on <DATE>April 4, 1968</DATE>.
   King's birthday was first celebrated as a national holiday in
<DATE>1986</DATE>, three years after <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> named the third <DATE>Monday</DATE> in <DATE>January</DATE>
as a holiday in his honor. All but six states have adopted the day
as a state holiday. The six states are <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, when black leaders symbolically struck the
Liberty Bell as a signal for bells to ring nationwide, Mayor <PERSON>W.
Wilson Goode</PERSON> cited the bell's famous crack.
   ``That crack is a symbol that there are some things
unfulfilled,'' <PERSON>Goode</PERSON> said.
   At the <ORGANIZATION>Michigan Capitol</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Lansing</LOCATION>, children struck the state's
replica of the <ORGANIZATION>Liberty Bell</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``He was a great man and he believed in what he was doing. He
tried to bring peace between all kinds of people,'' said <PERSON>Sharonda
Gardenhire</PERSON>, 10, of <LOCATION>Lansing</LOCATION>, shortly after she gave the rope a tug.
   A speech by one of <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s sons in <LOCATION>Eugene</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, was delayed for
about an hour after two telephoned bomb threats. The observance
resumed after the building was search and no bomb was found.
   <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King III</ORGANIZATION> said that in the 21 years since his father
was assassinated ``this nation has made great strides.'' But he
added that, ``I've got news for you. We've still got a long way to
do.''

   Wyoming's Legislature approved a bill
honoring slain civil rights leader <PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON> with a
holiday after debating the issue for seven years.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> voted 21-9 to concur with <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> changes to the

   Wyoming became the 46th state to honor
<PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON>'s ideals when Gov. <PERSON>Mike Sullivan</PERSON> signed
legislation <DATE>Thursday</DATE> creating a state holiday dedicated to equal
rights.
   Although <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> calls itself the <ORGANIZATION>Equality State</ORGANIZATION> because it was
the first to give women the vote, it took years for lawmakers to
agree to set aside the third <DATE>Monday</DATE> in <DATE>January</DATE> in <LOCATION>King</LOCATION>'s honor.
   Legislative leaders opposed to the holiday questioned whether
King should be singled out, noting that many other Americans also
fought for civil rights.
   The legislation <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> signed into law creates ``<PERSON>Martin Luther
King Jr</PERSON>. Wyoming Equality Day.''
   Championing the measure for the past eight years has been state
<PERSON>Sen. Liz Byrd</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Legislature</ORGANIZATION>'s only black.
   ``It was a real disappointment each year to watch the failure of
the <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr.</ORGANIZATION> legislation in the <LOCATION>Wyoming
Legislature</LOCATION>,'' she told the crowd jamming the <LOCATION>Statehouse</LOCATION> rotunda
for the signing ceremony. ``Those years of trying to get this
legislation passed were trying times. But today is a happy day.
Today is a historic day.
   ``What a wonderful centennial gift to be here today and to have
this bill,'' <PERSON>Byrd</PERSON> added, referring to <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>'s <DATE>100th birthday this
July 10</DATE>.
   The King holiday did not come easily. Senate opponents urged the
body to reject a holiday in King's name and support one simply
commemorating equal rights.
   The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> also was uneasy with the holiday in King's name only
and added the <ORGANIZATION>Wyoming Equality Day</ORGANIZATION> provision to the legislation.
   The four states that do not recognize the King holiday are
<LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>.

   Compromises have allowed <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> to join the movement
toward national acceptance of a holiday honoring the <ORGANIZATION>Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr.</ORGANIZATION> and by <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, 22 years after his death, only
three states were holdouts.
   ``I think it shows that we are making headway,'' <PERSON>Lloyd Davis</PERSON>,
executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>King Federal Holiday Commission</ORGANIZATION>, said
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   He expressed confidence that <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>
would not hold out much longer amid what he sees as dramatic
applications of <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s non-violent philosophy as far away as the
<LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>.
   ``What's happening around the world shows the universality of
King,'' <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   King was assassinated <DATE>April 4, 1968</DATE>, at age 39, while leading a
non-violent movement for racial equality. In <DATE>1983</DATE>, after
considerable debate, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> created a holiday to honor King on
the third <DATE>Monday</DATE> in <DATE>January</DATE>, around his <DATE>Jan. 15 birthday</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Day, first celebrated nationally in <DATE>1986</DATE>,
is an official state holiday in some form in most states _ <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> is
about to become the 47th.
   Wyoming, which calls itself the <ORGANIZATION>Equality State</ORGANIZATION> because it was
the first to give women the vote, had legislators who supported a
holiday commemorating equal rights but didn't want it in <LOCATION>King</LOCATION>'s
name. A compromise created <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Wyoming Equality
Day.
   Idaho legislators gave final approval <DATE>Friday</DATE> to an official
state holiday honoring <PERSON>King</PERSON>, but only after a compromise added
<ORGANIZATION>Idaho Human Rights Day</ORGANIZATION> to the designation. The bill has gone to
Gov. <PERSON>Cecil Andrus</PERSON>, who called for its passage in <DATE>January</DATE>.
   New Hampshire legislators have voted down holiday proposals
first introduced in <DATE>1979</DATE>. After losing in <DATE>1989</DATE>, supporters said
they would try again in <DATE>1991</DATE>, the next time legislative rules allow
it.
   ``There are times when <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> can feel pride in its
unique posture,'' state Rep. <PERSON>Deborah</PERSON> ``Arnie'' <PERSON>Arnesen</PERSON>, said
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. ``However, I feel that our unique status, vis-a-vis this
holiday, does not suggest a badge of courage but rather a badge of
intolerance and prejudice.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Edward Dupont</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>'s Senate Republican leader, says
the proposal won't succeed if the holiday is meant to honor King
alone. He suggested a day to honor King ``as one of many civil
rights contributors,'' including Presidents <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>,
rather than going along with national practice.
   ``We always have the distinction of being the last or the
first,'' he said. <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s Legislature in <DATE>1987</DATE> approved a bill
making <DATE>Jan. 15</DATE> a ``day of observance'' and creating <ORGANIZATION>Heritage Day</ORGANIZATION>, a
floating holiday to be designated by the governor. This year Gov.
<PERSON>Stan Stephens</PERSON> used it to create a long Thanksgiving weekend,
causing no controversy in a state whose black population was
counted at 1,786, or a fifth of a percent, in the <DATE>1980</DATE> census.
   <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> is the most populous state without a King holiday, but
it hasn't attained that status without contortions.
   Former Gov. <PERSON>Evan Mecham</PERSON>, a conservative who opposed his
predecessor's creation of a limited paid holiday in <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s honor,
proclaimed a <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King-Civil</ORGANIZATION> Rights Day for the third
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> in <DATE>January</DATE> instead.
   Last year, the <ORGANIZATION>Legislature</ORGANIZATION> approved King Day as a paid holiday
for state employees, and Gov. <PERSON>Rose Mofford</PERSON> signed the bill. But
opponents petitioned to prevent the law from taking effect unless
it's approved in a referendum in <DATE>November</DATE>.
   Some of the opponents were upset by revelations about womanizing
by King or were persuaded by the <PERSON>Ku Klux Klan</PERSON>'s repeated efforts to
tar King as a Communist. Others had nothing against honoring King,
but were up-at-arms that the Legislature made room in the budget
for King Day by dropping <ORGANIZATION>Columbus Day</ORGANIZATION> as a paid holiday.
   The Legislature took that course because Republican members
didn't like two alternatives: 1) combining the <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> birthdays into one Presidents<DATE>' Day</DATE>, as the federal
government did, or 2) springing for an additional holiday.
   While a holiday costs overtime pay for indispensable workers,
Mofford and other Democrats and some moderate Republicans argued
that not having one could also be expensive. The state has faced a
sporadic boycott, especially as a convention and meeting site.
   When the <ORGANIZATION>National Football League</ORGANIZATION>'s owners awarded the <DATE>1993</DATE>
Super Bowl to the <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> area <DATE>March 13</DATE>, <PERSON>Norman Braman</PERSON>, head of the
site selection committee, said: ``If there is a smear on the <ORGANIZATION>Martin
Luther King Holiday</ORGANIZATION> of any kind, I will personally lead the effort
to rescind the Super Bowl. We wouldn't want to go there.''
   <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> and suburban <LOCATION>Tempe</LOCATION>, where the game would be played, have
their own King holiday.

As Americans remembered <PERSON>Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON> on his 60th birthday 
anniversary with a candlelight vigil and prayers, his widow, <PERSON>Coretta Scott 
King</PERSON>, gave her annual "State of the Dream" address <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, calling the civil 
rights gains her late husband inspired "fragile" and warning that "much remains 
to be done." 
</P>
<P>
At <ORGANIZATION>Boston University's School of Theology</ORGANIZATION>, where King received a doctorate 
degree in <DATE>1955</DATE>, students and teachers gathered for a <DATE>Sunday</DATE> night candlelight

<P>
President-elect <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, returning to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> from a three-day

<LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
King was killed by a sniper on <DATE>April 4, 1968</DATE>, while standing on a motel balcony

</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>Selma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>, three blacks will be sworn in as members of the <ORGANIZATION>Dallas County 
Commission</ORGANIZATION> today. It was there that King began the historic <DATE>1965</DATE> 
Selma-to-Montgomery march that resulted in passage of the Voting Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
The swearing-in of <PERSON>Erskine Minor</PERSON>, <PERSON>Perry Varner</PERSON> and <PERSON>D. L. Pope</PERSON> will end 112 
years of white county rule and 10 years of legal battles to keep the commission 
white in a place where <PERCENT>55%</PERCENT> of the residents are black. The three new 
commissioners were elected in special balloting last month. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON>, speaking at the packed <ORGANIZATION>Ebenezer Baptist Church</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, where 
<PERSON>King</PERSON> and his father shared the pulpit, said the ceremony was to honor "a 
courageous young dreamer who picked up the torch of freedom and carried it from 
<LOCATION>Montgomery</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION> with an unshakable faith in the promise of the American 
dream. Martin passed that torch to us to continue the pursuit of the dream. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . Although the 'white only' signs of the <DATE>1950s</DATE> and <DATE>1960s</DATE> are gone," she 
said, "segregated neighborhoods and schools remain a pervasive fact of American 
life."

</P>
<P>
The city of <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> was hosting a ceremony and a tribute to King, including a 
performance today of a play written by students titled "Dreams." The play's 
title was taken from <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s moving <DATE>1963</DATE> "I Have a Dream" speech in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
An interfaith service was held in the nation's capital at the <ORGANIZATION>Washington Hebrew 
Congregation</ORGANIZATION> to commemorate <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s birthday, and the civil rights leader was 
remembered in religious services throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
In Salt <LOCATION>Lake City</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Mormon Church</ORGANIZATION> said it is closing its offices today to 
allow church employees to observe the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Boston University</ORGANIZATION> was holding religious services to commemorate <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s birthday 
and to mark today's holiday. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON>, in a sermon <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at a church in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s 
poverty-stricken <LOCATION>Harlem</LOCATION> section, lashed out at those who set back <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s 
efforts by "self-destruction" through drugs and violence. "<PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON> was our 
gift from God. <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON> did not fight and die for your right to use 
cocaine, crack and heroin," said <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>, who marched for civil rights with 
King. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson will be in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> today to deliver a sermon and help lead a parade. 
Tonight in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, he will receive the <ORGANIZATION>SCLC Martin Luther King Award</ORGANIZATION>.

L.A. CELEBRATES KING'S CAUSE AT PARADES, RALLIES 
</P>

They marched <DATE>Monday</DATE> -- through the streets of <LOCATION>South Los Angeles</LOCATION>, down the 
boulevards of <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>, even to a small church in <LOCATION>Inglewood</LOCATION> -- to protest 
apartheid, to celebrate civil rights and, above all, to honor the memory of <ORGANIZATION>Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
It would have been <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s <DATE>61st birthday</DATE>, and Southern Californians celebrated 
the work of the slain civil rights activist by parading down the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> 
thoroughfare that bears his name, protesting the racism that still exists in 
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> and abroad, and effectively shutting down an institution that did not 
close for the federal holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Gray skies hinted of rain, but police estimated that 70,000 people braved the 
chill air to watch the fifth annual King Birthday Parade, which began at the 
<ORGANIZATION>Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza</ORGANIZATION>, wound down <LOCATION>King Boulevard</LOCATION> and ended, 3.2 miles 
away, at the county <ORGANIZATION>Museum of Natural History</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Exposition Park</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"Those words 'we shall overcome' go a long way. They're even saying it in 
<LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>," said a smiling <PERSON>Ivan Jones</PERSON>, 73, as he watched his granddaughters march 
in the parade, which attracted a crowd more than three times the size of last 
year's. "It comes from <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King</ORGANIZATION>. Just keep it in your mind that we 
can do it, that we can overcome it." 
</P>
<P>
"Now we have a black governor, and it has nothing to do with the pigmentation 
of his skin," said <PERSON>Keith Strong</PERSON>, 36, referring to <PERSON>Lawrence Douglas Wilder</PERSON>, the 
newly inaugurated governor of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>. "It has to do with his ability. That's 
what <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON> was talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Amid the sounds of marching bands and high school drill teams were many somber 
and poignant declarations of African-American pride. A woman sold "Do the Right 
Thing" buttons and carried a sign that read "I Love Being Black." Another stood 
in the cool air with a sweat shirt that declared, "I Have Come This Far by 
Faith," and a family baked a special birthday cake for <PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON> and sold pieces 
of it, and other food items, from their front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
"I do this for his birthday," said <PERSON>Margie Manyweather</PERSON>, who spent a week 
planning and cooking the sweet potato pies, German chocolate cake and barbecued 
chicken her family sold. "What little money I make, I donate to the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
The image of another civil rights hero, one who has no holiday, also dotted the 
crowd. <PERSON>Gina Temple</PERSON>, 24, kept herself warm in a sweat shirt bearing a likeness 
of Malcolm X, while a vendor nearby sold T-shirts that showed Malcolm X and 
King shaking hands, over the words "Unity Is Strength." 
</P>
<P>
"I think, eventually, it should not be only <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s birthday (that we 
celebrate)," said <PERSON>Donyielle Holley</PERSON>, 24. "It should be a day where we celebrate 
all black leaders." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, while Mayor <PERSON>Tom Bradley</PERSON> rang the <ORGANIZATION>City Hall</ORGANIZATION> bell as part of a 
nationwide, simultaneous bell-ringing ceremony in honor of King, about 120 
activists gathered in front of <ORGANIZATION>Security Pacific National Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s downtown 
headquarters to protest a corporate decision to open more than 550 of its 
offices, despite the federal holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"When we realized that <ORGANIZATION>Security Pacific</ORGANIZATION> stood alone among banks, we thought 
they should be the focus of a protest," said <PERSON>Susan Anderson</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference of Greater Los Angeles</ORGANIZATION>. "We are worried that 
the message many businesses and individuals will get because of <ORGANIZATION>Security 
Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s example is that the holiday is an optional one." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Deborah Lewis</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Security Pacific</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said that "the sole purpose of 
the decision is to benefit our customers." She added that 20 branches did not 
open <DATE>Monday</DATE>, or later decided to close for the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
After the downtown protest ended, some of the participants drove to <LOCATION>Beverly 
Hills</LOCATION> to join more than 2,000 students and adult activists demonstrating in 
front of the former <ORGANIZATION>South African Consulate</ORGANIZATION> offices on <LOCATION>Wilshire Boulevard</LOCATION>. The 
group then marched along <LOCATION>Wilshire</LOCATION> to the current consulate on <LOCATION>La Cienega 
Boulevard</LOCATION>, where they staged a three-hour rally. 
</P>
<P>
Speakers criticized apartheid in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> as well as the racism and 
inequities that they say still exist in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Actress <PERSON>Alfre Woodard</PERSON>, directing her words at South African President <PERSON>Frederik 
W. de Klerk</PERSON>, said, "You are dressing up that tired old whore, apartheid, and 
squiring her out to the ball . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"And the shame is that some people in their drunken revelry are willing to 
dance with her, <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON>, how dare you qualify freedom by the color of the people who seek 
it?" <PERSON>Woodard</PERSON> said to the audience that had crowded the steps. She was alluding 
to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> support for the social revolution taking place in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION> while 
ignoring similar struggles in <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION>. "That is the dirty secret of our 
foreign policy." 
</P>
<P>
A group representing the <ORGANIZATION>Nation of Islam</ORGANIZATION> used the holiday to protest alleged 
<LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> police harassment of blacks during a <DATE>Jan. 3</DATE> fight between 24 
officers and 13 Muslims in the <ORGANIZATION>Crenshaw District</ORGANIZATION>. The incident began after a 
traffic stop and resulted in injuries to several members of each group and the 
arrests of all 13 Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
"We must come together in peace," <PERSON>Malik Muhammad</PERSON>, a member of the Brotherhood 
of the Black Man, told a crowd of about 100 at the rally in <LOCATION>Leimert Park</LOCATION>. "We 
don't have anything against the law. . . . They just didn't approach us in the 
right way, that's all. 
</P>
<P>
Muslim leaders have accused police of provoking the disturbance by 
unnecessarily trying to force blacks to lie down on the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a meeting with police to discuss the concerns, the 13 arrestees -- all 
members of the brotherhood -- face possible felony charges, according to 
police. 
</P>
<P>
Other holiday events <DATE>Monday</DATE> included a march in <LOCATION>Inglewood</LOCATION> that ended with a 
service at the <ORGANIZATION>First Church of God</ORGANIZATION>.

Pulitzer Prize-winning author <PERSON>Toni Morrison</PERSON> gave the keynote speech at the

   Worshippers filling the Rev. <PERSON>Martin Luther King
Jr.</PERSON>'s church were admonished today to remember the slain civil
rights leader's birthday by rededicating themselves to his work.
   ``It is our hope and our desire ... that we will realize it is an
unending quest,'' said the Rev. <PERSON>Joseph Roberts</PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION>Ebenezer
Baptist Church</ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON>King</PERSON> and his father preached.
   Roberts opened the annual ecumenical service that attracted
local, state and federal officials to mark the national holiday
honoring King. Among those gathered on the podium were members of
<PERSON>King</PERSON>'s family, the Rev. <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON>Dick
Thornburgh</PERSON>, actress <PERSON>Jane Fonda</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Joe Frank Harris</PERSON> and
the state's senators and congressmen.
   Thornburgh called King ``a martyr slain in his prime while trying
to make <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> and the world a place where justice, freedom and
peace could flourish.''
   President-elect <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> sent a letter to be read at the
service, in which he pledged that his administration ``will work
tirelessly for the strict enforcement of civil rights as well as for
absolute equality for all Americans.''
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> commemorated the holiday with a glowing
tribute to King in a speech to about 300 prominent blacks.
   ``He lived a hero's life. He dreamed a hero's dreams. He left a
hero's indelible mark on the mind and imagination of a great
nation,'' <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> told members of the <ORGANIZATION>Inaugural Afro-American Committee</ORGANIZATION>.
   Looking ahead to his inauguration on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said: ``What
becomes of <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON>'s dreams is up to us. We must not fail
him. We must not fail ourselves.''
   In <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Ambassador <PERSON>Edward Perkins</PERSON> marked the
holiday by unveiling a bronze bust of King on a bushy plot of land
in <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION> where the new <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> embassy is to stand.
   In <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON> invoked <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s
memory when he announced an executive order that will bar the state
from buying goods and services from companies that have dealings
with the South African government.
   In <LOCATION>Groton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, 51 demonstrators were arrested on charges of
disorderly conduct at the <ORGANIZATION>Electric</ORGANIZATION> Boat shipyard as they protested
the construction of Trident nuclear submarines. The demonstrators,
many carrying pictures of King and citing his belief in non-violent
protest, said the demonstration was held in observance of his
birthday.
   Elsewhere around the nation, planned observances of the King
holiday included the swearing-in of the first blacks on the <LOCATION>Dallas
County</LOCATION> (<LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>) Commission in more than a century. The ceremony was
scheduled for <LOCATION>Selma</LOCATION>, where King began the <DATE>1965</DATE> Selma-to-Montgomery
march that resulted in passage of the Voting Rights Act.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Liberty Bell</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> was to be symbolically tapped
today and church and school bells were being rung in <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>.
Golfers were to tee off in a suburban <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> tournament
benefiting King's <ORGANIZATION>Southern Christian Leadership Conference</ORGANIZATION>.
   The observance at <ORGANIZATION>Ebenezer Baptist Church</ORGANIZATION> capped a week of
remembrance in <LOCATION>King</LOCATION>'s hometown. At the church <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s widow
urged <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to hold true to his call for ``a kinder, gentler nation''
and to impose strict sanctions against <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   In addition, <PERSON>Coretta Scott King</PERSON> said in her annual ``State of the
Dream'' speech, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> must do more by ``providing
education and economic assistance directly to black <LOCATION>South Africans</LOCATION>
who bear the brunt of suffering in that troubled land.''
   ``I think we ought to take the president-elect at his word and
hold him to his call for a kinder, gentler nation where peace and
justice are in fact a reality,'' she said. ``But a kinder, gentler
nation will require kinder, gentler leaders.''
   <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON> spoke before an estimated 1,200 people at the church
where <PERSON>King</PERSON> and his father were co-pastors. It may have been her
final ``State of the Dream'' address as president of <ORGANIZATION>The King
Center</ORGANIZATION>, a memorial and policy center in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>.
   On <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, she announced that her 27-year-old son, <PERSON>Dexter Scott
King</PERSON>, would assume the presidency <DATE>April 4</DATE> _ the 21st anniversary of
<PERSON>King</PERSON>'s assassination at a <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, motel in <DATE>1968</DATE>.
   Today is the fourth year for the King national holiday. In <DATE>1983</DATE>,
after considerable debate, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> named the third <DATE>Monday</DATE> in
<DATE>January</DATE> as a national holiday honoring King, whose actual birthday
was <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   Most states also observe <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Day as a state
holiday. Among the few that don't is <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, where rallies were
planned in <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION> and where prospects are uncertain for
a measure that lawmakers plan to introduce this year.

<TEXT>
   Thousands marched and prayed and church bells rang on the
birthday of slain civil rights leader <PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON>, while
protesters demonstrated against states, schools and businesses not
observing the federal holiday.
   Three <PERSON>Ku Klux Klansmen</PERSON> handed out leaflets in <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>,
fights broke out between blacks and whites in <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South
Carolina</LOCATION> and racist graffiti was sprayed on signs on a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
highway named after King.
   King's survivors and others remembering him in services around
the nation said they harbored no illusions that his work was
finished.
   ``It's great that we celebrate his birthday but this day should
be a day where we recommit ourselves to finishing his dream,''
<PERSON>King</PERSON>'s son, <PERSON>Martin Luther King 3rd</PERSON>, who was 10 when his father died
in <DATE>1968</DATE>, told 500 people at a <ORGANIZATION>DePaul University</ORGANIZATION> church after
leading a candlelight march <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   King's widow, <PERSON>Coretta Scott King</PERSON>, spoke in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> at an annual
ecumenical service at <LOCATION>Ebenezer Baptist Church</LOCATION>, where her husband
delivered some of his most stirring orations.
   ``Now is the time to organize a global non-violent movement
based on <PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON>'s teachings, to put an end to the scourges of
poverty, hunger, racism and bigotry, war and militarism,'' she said.
   Security for the service was heavy following recent racially
motivated mail bombings in the Southeast. Bomb-sniffing dogs
inspected the church beforehand; visitors were required for the
first time to pass through metal detectors, and police took up
posts throughout the church during the service.
   Security also was heavy for a <DATE>March</DATE> of Celebration held later in
downtown <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>. Police estimated 400,000 people watched.
   A former top King lieutenant, the Rev. <PERSON>Hosea Williams</PERSON>,
complained that the parade trivialized the day and wasted money
better spent on the poor. ``This has been prostituted more than any
other holiday except Jesus Christ's birthday,'' he said outside an
<LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> housing project.
   About 25,000 people lined <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>' streets for the fifth
annual King Birthday Celebration Parade down a boulevard named for
him, and 2,500 turned out for an annual breakfast in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>. In
<LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, about 300 people gathered at The <PERSON>Lorraine Motel</PERSON>,
where King was assassinated on <DATE>April 4, 1968</DATE>.
   ``We didn't want the children to think that <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON>'s
birthday was just another day for watching television,'' said
<PERSON>Mardest Van Hooks</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION> teacher who helped bring a group of
youngsters to The <PERSON>Lorraine</PERSON>.
   The Washington-based <ORGANIZATION>Federal Holiday Commission</ORGANIZATION> said bells
chimed at <TIME>12:30 p.m.</TIME> EST in all 50 states and 144 countries. The
<ORGANIZATION>Liberty Bell</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> was tapped three times. The <ORGANIZATION>New York
Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> paused for a moment at noon.
   The holiday, first celebrated in <DATE>1986</DATE>, fell on <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s actual
birthday for the first time.
   In <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>, one of four states without any form of King
holiday, students at high schools in <LOCATION>Concord</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Milford</LOCATION>, Merrimack
and <LOCATION>Wolfeboro</LOCATION> staged protest rallies.
   ``<PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON> wasn't just for black people. He changed
everything for everyone, not just black people,'' <ORGANIZATION>Merrimack Valley
High</ORGANIZATION> senior <PERSON>John Morin</PERSON>, who is white, told fellow students.
   In <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, where the King holiday has long been a bitter
controversy, a <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> crowd estimated at nearly 15,000 heard
lawmakers and community leaders at the Capitol urge them to vote in
a referendum this <DATE>fall</DATE> over whether to let a King Day observance
become law.
   A bill to make the day a holiday was introduced <DATE>Monday</DATE> in the
<ORGANIZATION>Idaho Senate</ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> also has no form of King Holiday, while some
other states keep workers on the job but mark the day in other ways.
   About 200 people protested outside a bank in <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, that
stayed open. <PERSON>Norman Eenith</PERSON>, 35, held an outstretched dollar bill
and said, ``This is what it's all about.''
   In <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>, following a parade in King's honor attended by
tens of thousands, two whites were arrested after a fight in which
a black man was hit with nail-studded boards, officials said.
   At <ORGANIZATION>Garrett High School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, one of several area
schools that canceled the day off to make up for days lost during
Hurricane Hugo, about five black students angry at having to attend
school on the holiday assaulted two white students, Principal <PERSON>Rex
Whitcomb</PERSON> said. Police helped restore order.
   In <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, two signs on 10-mile stretch of highway named for
King were painted with swastikas and the letters ``SWP,'' thought
to stand for ``Supreme White Power,'' police said.
   In <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, a county commissioner said he received numerous
telephone threats after he protested a newspaper advertisement
depicting <PERSON>King</PERSON>, a birthday cake and a garbage truck. The ad said
trash would be picked up as usual <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   ``All of a sudden I recognized that I felt a particular fear
that as a young white man, fairly protected growing up, I had never
felt before _ what so many people in this group must have felt,''
<PERSON>Yordon</PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Bill Providing King Holiday Passes in Idaho</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Idaho House</ORGANIZATION> approved legislation
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to make <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> the 47th state with a holiday honoring
slain civil rights leader <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> voted 53-27 for the bill previously passed by the
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>. Later, the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> accepted a <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> amendment that made the
holiday's complete name ``Martin Luther King Jr.-Idaho Human Rights
Day.''
   Final approval by the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> was expected <DATE>Thursday</DATE> before the
bill goes to Gov. <PERSON>Cecil Andrus</PERSON>, who proposed the holiday.
   The bill was the subject of tortuous arguments in the
legislature last week. Opponents said their constituents didn't
care about <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We're told this isn't a black holiday, but yet we're also told
we can't change the name,'' said Rep. <PERSON>Stan Hawkins</PERSON>, a Republican.
``If you really have a guilt trip in mind by passing this, you're
making a mistake.''
   Rep. <PERSON>L. Ed Brown</PERSON>, also a Republican and one of the bill's
sponsors, said the decision on the bill would ``say more about
<LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> than .. about <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON>.''
   ``<LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> is not the state in the <LOCATION>Union</LOCATION> that's going to determine
<PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON>'s greatness,'' <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> said. ``Forty-six states
and the federal government have already done that.''
   <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> said adopting a King holiday would ``send a very special
message to future generations about how Idahoans feel about
minorities.''
   Besides <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, only <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> have not
adopted state holidays corresponding with the federal holiday
honoring King on the third <DATE>Monday</DATE> in <DATE>January</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Idaho Legislature</ORGANIZATION> created a state commemorative day in <DATE>1987</DATE>,
and a bill creating a state holiday died in a <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> committee last
year despite arguments its failure would only reinforce the
perception some have of <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> as a haven for racists.
   Opponents said they objected to another day off for government
employees. Proponents said <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>'s economy would suffer through
lost tourism and convention business if it failed to establish the
holiday.

<LEADPARA>  Remembering Martin Luther King Jr. and his commitment to peace was high on the
agenda of "Freedom Train" riders waiting at the Southern Pacific station in
San Jose this morning.;    "I'm coming to honor what Martin Luther King
represented," said Neil Cossman, 48, of San Jose, as he waited for the train
to leave for San Francisco and the annual celebration of King's life and
legacy. "I want to make a statement against the war, and I think this

<TEXT>     "Until you end war, you won't end poverty, and until you end poverty, you
won't end racism," <PERSON>Cossman</PERSON> said. "They are all tied together. The things he
represented are being set back by war in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>.";    He added, "Every time a
plane goes down, the money spent on that plane represents I don't know how
many other lives lost to poverty, in addition to the tragedy of the loss of
the pilot's life.";    <PERSON>Dr. Amos Brown</PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION>Third Baptist Church</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and chairman for that city's program today, was in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> to
ride the train.;    <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> saw definite parallels between <PERSON>King</PERSON> and the war in
the <LOCATION>Middle East.</LOCATION>;    "King was a non-violent prophet-philosopher who took a
stand calling for the end of the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War, even when it was unpopular to do
so," <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> recalled. "I often heard him say it would have been morally
inconsistent for him to talk about freedom and justice for blacks and not be
concerned about lives in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>.";    He believes the slain civil rights
leader "would have said we should have gone to the conference table to
negotiate a settlement. He would have raised some serious questions regarding
the fairness and justice of 25 to <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> of the men and women in the
<LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> being black or other minorities. He would have seen this as a
fallout of racism and injustice in our nation.";    In <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> <DATE>today</DATE>,
several hundred people gathered in a poor neighborhood in a march to
commemorate <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s birthday.;    Participants carried placards that read
"There has got to be a way to connect the human race," and other slogans
reminiscent of the slain civil rights leader's non-violent philosophy.;    "We
have come to Bayview-Hunters Point to affirm peace in our society and to deal
with our domestic problems -- drugs and violence," said the Rev. <PERSON>Cecil
Williams</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Glide Memorial United Methodist Church.</ORGANIZATION>;    "This is an
affirmation of what <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON> preached -- pro-peace, not anti-war,"
he said. "We want to live peace. We want to stop the war.";    In <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> on
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON>Coretta Scott King</PERSON> and others observing the civil rights
leader's birthday remembered him as an advocate of non-violence and urged an
immediate halt to the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> war.;    "Our most urgent short-term
priority at the international level is a cease-fire in the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION>,"
<PERSON>Coretta King</PERSON> said in her annual State of the Dream speech <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at <LOCATION>Ebenezer
Baptist Church.</LOCATION>;    In <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, Girl Scouts in a <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> parade honoring King on
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> carried a 10-foot-long banner saying, "King's dream did not include
war.";    Today's holiday winds up 10 days of celebrations marking <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s
birthday. Assassinated in <DATE>1968</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>King</ORGANIZATION> would have turned 62 on <DATE>Jan. 15</DATE>. The

Afro-Americans.";    <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> noted that a large percentage of blacks are

   Worshipers at <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr.</ORGANIZATION>'s church
were urged today on the slain civil rights leader's birthday to
keep alive his memory and his philosophy of non-violence.
   ``This is a man who is a deep current in our memory,'' said the
Rev. <PERSON>Cecil Williams</PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION>Glide Memorial United Methodist
Church</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. ``Let us live then not only his dream, but
let us live the practice of non-violence and unconditional love.''
   Williams spoke at the annual ecumenical service at <ORGANIZATION>Ebenezer
Baptist Church</ORGANIZATION>.
   Church services, parades, and other celebrations were held
nationwide during the weekend before the federal holiday, which for
the first time falls on the slain civil-rights leader's actual
birthday.
   He would have been 61 today.
   Also planned today in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> was a ``March of Celebration''
parade, being televised nationally for the first time.
   A former King lieutenant, the Rev. <PERSON>Hosea Williams</PERSON>, stood in
front of an <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> housing project to criticize the day's
activities for making a travesty of <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s dream of equality and
justice.
   Williams, <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s field organizer in the civil rights movement,
complained that people were starving in the city while thousands of
dollars were being spent on the parade. ``I am really upset with
all this gaiety,'' he said.
   This year's holiday follows a series of bombings and threats,
apparently racially motivated, in the Southeast, and a flareup of
racial tensions in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> after an apparent hoax in which a white
man had claimed a black mugger fatally shot his pregnant wife.
   It also comes at a time of gains for blacks _ the election of
<PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON>, first black mayor of <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>, and the nation's
first elected black governor, <PERSON>L. Douglas Wilder</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>.
   ``Today, the sound of libery is being heard all around the
world,'' said <PERSON>James Farmer</PERSON>, founder of the <ORGANIZATION>Congress for Racial
Equality</ORGANIZATION>, as he pounded three times with his fist on the <ORGANIZATION>Liberty
Bell</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>. ``Those who have been denied liberty love it
most. Dr. King loved liberty and he fought and died for it.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> held a moment of silence at noon.
   In <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>, one of just four states without some form of
King holiday, about 200 <ORGANIZATION>Merrimack Valley High School</ORGANIZATION> pupils walked
out of morning classes today in <LOCATION>Concord</LOCATION> to recognize <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther
King Day</ORGANIZATION>, which the school does not observe.
   ``This is our own personal way of remembering him,'' said senior
<PERSON>Mike Krumenacker</PERSON>, one of three pupils who organized the impromptu
gathering of about a third of the school's pupils.
   And in another of the four states, <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, thousands marched in
<LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION> today to honor King. A racially mixed crowd
carried black balloons along a four-mile stretch of downtown
<LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> as they headed for a rally at the state Capitol.
   King, the son of an <LOCATION>Atlanta Baptist</LOCATION> minister, led non-violent
marches in the South in the <DATE>1950s</DATE> and <DATE>1960s</DATE> in a quest to end
discrimination against blacks and other minorities. He was
assassinated on <DATE>April 4, 1968</DATE>, in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn</LOCATION>.
   On <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <PERSON>Coretta Scott King</PERSON> delivered her annual ``state of
the dream'' address at <ORGANIZATION>Ebenezer Baptist Church</ORGANIZATION>.
   King's widow applauded pro-democracy shifts worldwide and said
the civil rights movement would not be deterred by the recent wave
of bombings and threats against blacks. A federal judge and a black
<LOCATION>Savannah</LOCATION> lawyer were killed in two bombings.
   ``In the <DATE>last year</DATE>, we've seen hundreds of thousands of people
marching through the streets of <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Budapest</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Prague</LOCATION>, all singing `We Shall
Overcome' in a host of languages,'' she said.
   ``We're not going to be turned around by letter bombs or threats
or any kind of violence,'' she said. ``Instead, we're going
forward, with unity and courage and commitment.''
   Also in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, more than 500 students and teachers at <ORGANIZATION>Booker
T. Washington High School</ORGANIZATION> joined civil rights leader <PERSON>Rosa Parks</PERSON> to
paint a mural dedicated to King. The mural displayed, ``Let Freedom
Ring.''
   In <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, where blacks have complained about aggressive police
tactics in their search for the killer of a pregnant white woman in
<DATE>October</DATE>, about 25 activists planned to demonstrate at a King
memorial breakfast today to protest the presence of Mayor <PERSON>Raymond
Flynn</PERSON>.
   Tensions have been heightened after revelations that <PERSON>Charles
Stuart</PERSON> himself probably killed his wife. He committed suicide this
month.
   ``We don't feel Mayor <PERSON>Flynn</PERSON> should have a seat of honor at this
occasion,'' said <PERSON>Sadiki Kambon</PERSON>, director of a group called the
<ORGANIZATION>Community for Human Rights</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The mayor came on the scene that (<DATE>October</DATE>) <TIME>night</TIME> and was told
by police that an African male killed a white female,'' <PERSON>Kambon</PERSON>
said. ``The mandate was `Get me someone,' and the police proceeded
to roust black males in <LOCATION>Mission Hill</LOCATION> and the entire city.''
   In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> told about 400 people at <ORGANIZATION>Judson Memorial
Church</ORGANIZATION> that ``<PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON> took us to the dawn of a new era. It is up
to us to push on into the bright light of day.''
   Wilder, sworn in <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, said on ABC-TV's ``This Week With
<PERSON>David Brinkley</PERSON>'' on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> that a black could occupy the <ORGANIZATION>White
House</ORGANIZATION> ``in our time.''
   In <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>, the Rev. <PERSON>Joseph Lowery</PERSON>, president and co-founder of
the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Christian Leadership Conference</ORGANIZATION>, addressed 900 people
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   ``Don't let them make a pious dreamer out of him,'' <PERSON>Lowery</PERSON> said.
``He was a non-violent revolutionary. ... The spirit of <ORGANIZATION>Martin
Luther King</ORGANIZATION> demands that we be activists.''
   Federal offices were closed today, and most states gave the day
off to their workers as well. The four without any form of King
holiday are <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>, but some
other states kept workers on the job but marked the day in some
other way.

   Church bells across the country tolled the loss of <PERSON>Martin Luther
King Jr.</PERSON> on his birthday <DATE>Monday</DATE>, a ringing reminder of the racial
conflicts the slain civil rights leader struggled to overcome but
which still haunt the nation.
   ``With each ring we are called to an accountability, an
accountability of the soul and of the heart's conscience that asks,
`What have you done to let freedom ring?''' asked <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> Gov.
<PERSON>Robert P. Casey</PERSON> during a ceremony at the <ORGANIZATION>Liberty Bell</ORGANIZATION>.
   A moment of silence was called to reflect on <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s lessons of
non-violence in his pursuit of racial equality. The
Washington-based <ORGANIZATION>Federal Holiday Commission</ORGANIZATION> said bells chimed at
<TIME>12:30 p.m.</TIME> EST in all 50 states and 144 countries. The <ORGANIZATION>New York
Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> paused for a moment at noon.
   ``Today, the sound of liberty is being heard all around the
world,'' said <PERSON>James Farmer</PERSON>, founder of the <ORGANIZATION>Congress for Racial
Equality</ORGANIZATION>, who pounded the <ORGANIZATION>Liberty Bell</ORGANIZATION> three times with his fist.
``Those who have been denied liberty love it most. Dr. King loved
liberty and he fought and died for it.''
   Most of the celebrations were peaceful, but the memory of <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s
espousal of nonviolent resistance didn't prevent fights from
breaking out in <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION> following a parade in his honor
attended by tens of thousands of people.
   Two whites were arrested after a fight in which a black man was
hit with nail-studded boards. A teen-ager was fatally stabbed and a
young black man was critically wounded by a stray bullet in
separate fights between groups of black teens, officials said.
   In <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, racist graffitti was sprayed on signs on a freeway
named for him,and demonstrations protesting non-observance of the
holiday took place in <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> and elsewhere.
   The observances followed church services, parades, and other
celebrations held during the weekend before the federal holiday,
which for the first time falls on King's actual birthday. He would
have been 61.
   Much of <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s focus was on <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, where <PERSON>King</PERSON> grew up as the
son of a Baptist minister.
   ``Now is the time to organize a global non-violent movement
based on <PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON>'s teachings, to put an end to the scourges of
poverty, hunger, racism and bigotry, war and militarism,'' said his
widow, <PERSON>Coretta Scott King</PERSON>, at an annual ecumenical service at
<LOCATION>Ebenezer Baptist Church</LOCATION>, where her husband delivered some of his
most stirring orations.
   A ``March of Celebration'' also was held, despite bitter
objections from one of <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s top lieutenants in the civil rights
movement who charged the parade trivialized the day and wasted
money that could serve the poor.
   ``This has been prostituted more than any other holiday except
Jesus Christ's birthday,'' the Rev. <PERSON>Hosea Williams</PERSON> said at a news
conference in front of an <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> housing project.
   About 25,000 people lined <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>' streets for the fifth
annual King Birthday Celebration Parade down a boulevard named for
him, and 2,500 turned out for an annual breakfast in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>.
   During his lifetime, <PERSON>King</PERSON> led non-violent marches and protests
in the South in the <DATE>1950s</DATE> and <DATE>1960s</DATE> in a quest to end
discrimination against blacks and other minorities.
   His first blow against racism came when he led a year long
bocott of segregated buses in <LOCATION>Montgomery</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ala</LOCATION>. From there he
established the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Christian Leadership Conference</ORGANIZATION> to set the
pace of working peacefully for equal rights for blacks. In <DATE>1964</DATE>, he
received the <ORGANIZATION>Nobel Peace Prize</ORGANIZATION>.
   He was shot and killed on <DATE>April 4, 1968</DATE>, in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn</LOCATION>.
   But racial inequities and clashes still tear at <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s
consciousness today.
   In the Southeast, there have been a series of bombings and
threats, apparently racially motivated, and in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> race
relations were strained after an apparent hoax in which a white man
claimed a black mugger fatally shot his pregnant wife and wounded
him.
   Boston residents on <DATE>Monday</DATE> spoke of the racial implications of
<PERSON>Charles Stuart</PERSON>'s grisly fraud.
   ``The <PERSON>Stuart</PERSON> case has shown how fragile race relations are in
this country,'' said state Rep. <PERSON>Byron Rushing</PERSON>. ``And it's become a
kind of metaphor for healing.''
   The day, however, came at a moment of gains for blacks, the
first day on the job for the nation's first elected black governor
in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> and the start of a new administion for <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>'s
first black mayor.
   L. <PERSON>Douglas Wilder</PERSON>'s victory in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> inspires, some said.
   ``Is it not poetic justice that the first day of <PERSON>Doug Wilder</PERSON>'s
stay in office takes place on the birthday of <PERSON>Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr.</PERSON>?'' the Rev. <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON> asked at a prayer breakfast in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>
   In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, about 120 people who walked across the <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION>
Bridge to <ORGANIZATION>City Hall</ORGANIZATION> in the 10th annual march were greeted by Mayor
<PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON>.
   In addition to the gala celebrations, <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s birthday was marked
with protests.
   Several took place in <LOCATION>Concord</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.H</LOCATION>. About 150 <ORGANIZATION>Merrimack Valley
High School</ORGANIZATION> students walked out of morning classes to recognize
<ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Day, which their school did not observe.
   A school custodian hoisted the American flag half-staff as the
students recited the <ORGANIZATION>Pledge of Allegiance</ORGANIZATION> during the half-hour
ceremony.
   <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> is one of four states without any form of King
holiday. The others are <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>. Some other
states keep workers on the job, but mark the day in other ways.
   Several hundred students and faculty members at <ORGANIZATION>St. Paul's
School</ORGANIZATION>, which announced <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> that it would observe the
holiday, marched from the private school's <LOCATION>Concord</LOCATION> campus to the
<LOCATION>Statehouse</LOCATION>.
   More than 200 students in <LOCATION>Milford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.H.</LOCATION>, staged a sit-in at the
high school library, and 125 in <LOCATION>Wolfeboro</LOCATION> staged a lunchtime
demonstration that kept them out of classes for two hours.
   In another <LOCATION>Concord</LOCATION> demonstration, about 150 members of the
anti-nuclear <ORGANIZATION>Clamshell Alliance</ORGANIZATION> marched from the Federal Building
to the <LOCATION>Statehouse</LOCATION> plaza to protest the <PERSON>Seabrook</PERSON> nuclear plant.
   They sang songs against the plant and such civil rights hymns as
``We Shall Overcome.'' Thirty-seven people who stayed inside the
<ORGANIZATION>Statehouse</ORGANIZATION> after closing time were arrested on criminal trespass
charges.
   In <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, where the King holiday has long been a bitter
controversy, a <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> crowd estimated by police at nearly 15,000
heard lawmakers and community leaders at the capitol urge them to
register and vote in a referendum this <DATE>fall</DATE> over whether to let a
King Day observance become law. Another 2,000 people marched in
<LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION>.
   A bill to make the day a holiday was introduced in the <ORGANIZATION>Idaho
Senate</ORGANIZATION>, but an effort to win immediate consideration for a similar
bill was defeated in the <ORGANIZATION>South Dakota House</ORGANIZATION>.
   In <LOCATION>Columbia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mo.</LOCATION>, about 200 students sat down inside the
<ORGANIZATION>University of Missouri</ORGANIZATION>'s administration building to protest the
school's decision not to cancel classes for the day.
   About 100 people in <LOCATION>Monroe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>La.</LOCATION>, demonstrated outside the
<ORGANIZATION>Ouachita Parish School Board</ORGANIZATION> to protest its refusal to observe the
holiday.
   In <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, two signs on 10-mile stretch of highway named for
King were painted overnight with swastikas and the letters ``SWP,''
thought to stand for ``Supreme White Power,'' said police Lt. <PERSON>John
Gregory</PERSON>.

<HEAD>Coretta Scott King Seeks Federal Funds for Holiday Commission</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coretta <PERSON>Scott King</PERSON> says <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> must provide
``the means and encouragement'' for the federal commission that
coordinates observances of the holiday honoring her late husband,
the <ORGANIZATION>Rev. Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> placed an enormous responsibility upon the
commission, but it gave no funds,'' <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON>, who chairs the
<ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Federal Holiday Commission</ORGANIZATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>
panel <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   ``I ask the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> which gave birth to the national holiday to
help us continue our work _ to give us the means and encouragement
to complete the job we have just started.''
   The King commission was created on a temporary basis in <DATE>1984</DATE> as
part of a bill to make the civil rights leader's birthday a
national holiday. Because of opposition to the bill from some
conservative members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, led by <PERSON>Sen. Jesse Helms</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-N.C.</LOCATION>,
funding plans for the commission were dropped in order to get the
bill passed.
   The commission's congressional mandate expires in <DATE>April 1989</DATE>,
and a bill sponsored by Rep. <PERSON>John Conyers</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Mich.</LOCATION>, now before the
census and population subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION>House Post Office and
Civil Service Committee</ORGANIZATION>, would provide <MONEY>$300,000</MONEY> in annual funding.
   <PERSON>Sen. Lowell Weicker</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Conn.</LOCATION>, a supporter of the <PERSON>Conyers</PERSON> bill,
said requests to the commission now outstrip what the group is able
to accomplish.
   ``The commission has more work than the meager resources it has
been able to raise from the private sector can begin to support,''
<PERSON>Weicker</PERSON> said.
   Rep. <PERSON>Mervyn Dymally</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Calif.</LOCATION>, who chairs the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> panel,
agreed and pledged to add an amendment to the legislation that
would increase funding to at least <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> per year.
   The commission processed more than 5,000 information requests
and helped 135 state and local governments plan holiday events in
<DATE>1987</DATE>, according to commission records.
   The Atlanta-based commission collected <MONEY>$183,552</MONEY> in private
contributions in <DATE>1987</DATE>, and has no paid employees, the records
showed.
   Nearly all money received went to producing newsletters and
pamphlets on <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s life, said <PERSON>Lloyd Davis</PERSON>, the commission's
executive director. Staff assistance comes from federal employees
``loaned out'' from their agencies on a temporary basis, he said.
   By contrast, the <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION> on the Bicentennial of the <ORGANIZATION>United
States Constitution</ORGANIZATION> will receive <MONEY>$21 million</MONEY> in federal money this
year, while the <ORGANIZATION>United States Holocaust Memorial Council</ORGANIZATION> will
receive just over <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY>.
   ``We're talking about a desperate situation,'' <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said. ``We
simply can't do it without some federal help.''
   <PERSON>Dymally</PERSON> said the bill should reach the full <ORGANIZATION>Post Office and
Civil Service Committee</ORGANIZATION> next week, and be considered on the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>
floor in <DATE>September</DATE>.
   The holiday is officially celebrated on the third <DATE>Monday</DATE> in
<DATE>January</DATE>, which falls close to <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s <DATE>Jan. 15 birthday</DATE>. The only
states that do not observe the date are <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>.
   Besides King, only <PERSON>George Washington</PERSON> and <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON> have
their birthdays marked by national holidays.
   Meanwhile, <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON> revealed some of the plans for a second
<DATE>March</DATE> on <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, to be held in commemoration of the historic
``I Have a Dream'' speech her husband delivered 25 years ago before
more than 200,000 civil rights activists in front of the <LOCATION>Lincoln
Memorial</LOCATION>.
   The celebration, scheduled for <DATE>Aug. 27</DATE>, will focus on
employment, housing and civil rights issues, she said.

   The Rev. <PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON> was remembered from the pulpit by
fellow clergymen <DATE>Sunday</DATE> as a man whose ``spiritual genius'' and
Christian faith inspired a rebirth of freedom.
   The official national holiday in his honor isn't until <DATE>Monday</DATE>,
but King was hailed in sermons and speeches <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, the day the
murdered civil rights leader would have turned 60.
   ``It's not just a one-day remembrance, but we need to remember
every day what he stood for and what he died for,'' the Rev. <PERSON>Clay
Evans</PERSON>, who worked with <PERSON>King</PERSON>, told worshipers at <ORGANIZATION>Fellowship Baptist
Church</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. ``I think we have to make it not just a dream,
and not just make it a hollow day ... but a holy day.''
   King's widow, <PERSON>Coretta Scott King</PERSON>, delivered her annual ``State of
the Dream'' speech to 1,200 people crammed into <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>'s historic
<LOCATION>Ebenezer Baptist Church</LOCATION>, where <PERSON>King</PERSON> and his father were co-pastors.
   She urged President-elect <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> to hold true to his call
for ``a kinder, gentler nation'' by imposing strict sanctions
against <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and providing direct financial support to
``black <LOCATION>South Africans</LOCATION> who bear the brunt of suffering in that
troubled land.''
   <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON> urged <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to ``put behind the politics of the past''
by addressing several issues during his term of office: affordable
housing, a stepped-up war on drugs and racial violence and the
appointment of federal judges ``who are as tough on discrimination
as they are on street crimes.''
   King, born <DATE>Jan. 15, 1929</DATE>, was assassinated <DATE>April 4, 1968</DATE>, at age
39 on the balcony of a motel in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn</LOCATION>. His killer, <PERSON>James
Earl Ray</PERSON>, is in prison.
   In <DATE>1983</DATE>, after considerable debate, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> approved creation of
a holiday to honor King on the third <DATE>Monday</DATE> in <DATE>January</DATE>. It was the
first holiday honoring a black American. The first official national
celebration was held in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Day is a state holiday as well as a
federal holiday in all but a handful of states.
   Many cities and states planned their main celebration for <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> planned to attend an ecumenical prayer breakfast organized by
the <ORGANIZATION>Inaugural Afro-American Committee</ORGANIZATION>.
   King's birthday was to be observed at a number of other
celebrations in the capital, including a benefit and fashion show.
   In <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, a state senator was selected to ring the state's
<ORGANIZATION>Liberty Bell</ORGANIZATION> at the Capitol at <TIME>12:30 p.m. EST</TIME> <DATE>Monday</DATE>. At the same
moment, bells at churches, schools and colleges throughout <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>
will ring in memory of <LOCATION>King</LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>Liberty Bell</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, which
can no longer be rung, will be struck symbolically.
   In <LOCATION>Selma</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE>, the first blacks on the <ORGANIZATION>Dallas County
Commission</ORGANIZATION> in more than a century will take the oath of office. It
was there that King began the historic <DATE>1965</DATE> Selma-to-Montgomery
march that resulted in passage of the Voting Rights Act.
   But <DATE>Sunday</DATE> was a day in particular to remember <PERSON>King</PERSON>, who drew his
inspiration, his rhetoric and his philosophy from his Christian
faith, in churches.
   ``King was (a) man who was concerned about people regardless of
color and ethnic background,'' said the Rev. <PERSON>J. Allen Nimmo</PERSON> of the
<ORGANIZATION>Tenth Street Baptist Church</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Camden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>
   ``<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> should remember that <PERSON>Martin Luther</PERSON> gave his life that
we might live together,'' said <PERSON>Nimmo</PERSON>, who knew <PERSON>King</PERSON> and his family.
``The dream has not yet come true, but I think we are going to get
there. But we are going to have to struggle together.''
   Some who stopped to remember <DATE>King this weekend</DATE> had more personal
memories.
   ``He was a man who enjoyed a good laugh, missed his wife and
children when he was away, who got sad sometimes, who could be a
perfect friend,'' said <PERSON>Helen Maybell Anglin</PERSON>, who runs a restaurant
in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. Another soul food restaurant of hers, the now-defunct
H&amp;H Cafe, which was one of <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s favorite <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> eateries.
   Even as supporters of King celebrated his spirit, some warned
that the civil rights movement has grown lethargic. Others said that
racial bias is on the rise.
   ``There is a clear and present danger that the dream of <PERSON>Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON> is at risk of being derailed,'' the Rev.
<PERSON>Wyatt Tee Walker</PERSON>, chief of staff for King in the early <DATE>1960s</DATE>.
   ``The establishment of a federal national holiday has seduced us
into becoming comfortable with <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON>,'' <PERSON>Walker</PERSON> told
worshipers at <ORGANIZATION>Riverside Church</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>. He compared King to
Jesus and said <PERSON>King</PERSON> was ``the only authentic spiritual genius that
Western religion has produced.''
   <PERSON>Hazel Dukes</PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> state conference of
branches of the <ORGANIZATION>NAACP</ORGANIZATION>, said King ``would be very disappointed with
us.''
   ``He would be saddened to see how we have lost the fervor of us
coming together, the races of people, Jews and gentiles, white and
black,'' she said.
   In a speech at a <LOCATION>Harlem</LOCATION> church to about 1,500 people, the Rev.
<PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON> said that too many young blacks have a misconceived
notion of what their civil rights are. He chastised youngsters who
think it is their constitutional right to take illegal drugs.
   ``That is a civil wrong. <PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON> did not die for your right to
sniff cocaine and crack and heroin. Stay the dream. Don't betray the
dream,'' <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> said.

<LEADPARA>  An exhibit of historical photos and papers celebrating the accomplishments of
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and the American civil rights movement will
make its debut in Gilroy starting Monday -- the day before what would have
been the slain civil rights leader's 62 birthday.;    Titled "Martin Luther
King Jr. and the Modern Black Freedom Struggle," the exhibit is a traveling
version of a similar permanent collection at Stanford University.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  GAVILAN EXHIBIT TO CELEBRATE KING'S WORKS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     It is on loan to <ORGANIZATION>Gavilan College</ORGANIZATION> from the university's <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King
Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Papers Project and marks the first time it will appear publicly outside
Stanford.;    <PERSON>Leah Halper</PERSON>, a writer and journalism professor at <LOCATION>Gavilan</LOCATION>,
arranged for the exhibit to celebrate both <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s birthday and <ORGANIZATION>Black History
Month</ORGANIZATION> in February.;    "Too often Black History Month goes unmarked," she
said. "It's important to acknowledge the contributions to society that
different groups have made.";    <PERSON>Halper</PERSON> learned of the traveling exhibit
through <PERSON>Stewart Burns</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>'s associate editor of the King project, and
wanted to make it the focus of what might be <PERSON>Gavilan</PERSON>'s first formal
celebration of Black History Month.;    "It's very important that everything
that has been gained in civil rights has been fought for and we need to
remember the people that did that," she said.;    "I think it's well worth the
drive up to <LOCATION>Gavilan</LOCATION>. I hope the people from the greater <PERSON>Gilroy</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Hill</ORGANIZATION>
and <PERSON>Hollister</PERSON> areas come to see it.";    Using photographs, magazine articles
from the <DATE>1960s</DATE> and documents from the permanent collection of King papers, the
traveling exhibit "tries to tell the story of the black freedom movement and
King," <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> said.;    Since this is perhaps <PERSON>Gavilan</PERSON>'s first formal exhibit
for <ORGANIZATION>Black History Month</ORGANIZATION>, he said, "It's fitting they would have a really high
quality exhibit.";    He also said that the exhibit's title accurately
reflects the experience of African-Americans and others during <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s era.;   
"We use 'black freedom movement or black freedom struggle,' " he said,
"because 'civil rights movement' doesn't do justice to the depth and
significance of the movement. It really was a movement for freedom.";    Plans
call for the exhibit to be available to <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION> public and private schools,
from elementary through college levels. Public schools will be given top
priority, <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> said.;    Meanwhile, the project's main task, producing
volumes of <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s speeches, sermons, writings, correspondence and other
papers, continues at Stanford.;    Initial volumes, <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> said, are scheduled
for publication by the <ORGANIZATION>University of California Press</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1992.</DATE>; IF YOU'RE
INTERESTEDThe exhibit will be shown through <DATE>Feb. 15</DATE> in the <LOCATION>Gavilan</LOCATION> library and
may be viewed from <TIME>8 a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>8 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Monday-Thursday</DATE> and <TIME>8 a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>5 p.m.</TIME>
<DATE>Fridays</DATE>. For more information, contact the college at (408) 847-1400.  </TEXT>

<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation declaring the third <DATE>Monday</DATE> in
<DATE>January</DATE> an official state holiday honoring <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr.</ORGANIZATION>
won final legislative approval today.
   Senate passage of the bill establishing the <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King
Jr.-Idaho Human Rights Day</ORGANIZATION> removed <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> from the dwindling list of
states still refusing to honor the slain civil rights leader with
an official holiday.
   The bill, clearing the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> on a 28-11 vote, now goes to Gov.
<PERSON>Cecil Andrus</PERSON>, who called for its passage in his State of the <ORGANIZATION>State</ORGANIZATION>
address to open the session last <DATE>January</DATE>.
   ``We've come a long way down the road,'' said <PERSON>Sen. Mary Lou
Reed</PERSON>, a Democrat, citing the past four years since the state
designated the third <DATE>Monday</DATE> in <DATE>January</DATE> as a commemorative day for
King.
   Only three other states are now without King holidays _ <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>.
   The <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> measure, however, faced a somewhat rocky road in a
Legislature that has passed some of the toughest anti-racism laws
in the nation, including a criminal malicious harassment law and
mandatory hate-crime reporting.
   After winning initial <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> passage, it was sidetracked in the
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> until a compromise was agreed to on the formal name. The
agreement added <ORGANIZATION>Idaho Human Rights Day</ORGANIZATION> to the designation.
   The holiday was pushed by lawmakers and the governor in part to
offset the negative image the state has developed because of the
presence of white supremacists at the <ORGANIZATION>Aryan Nations</ORGANIZATION> compound of
<PERSON>Richard Butler</PERSON> in northern <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>.
   But now with the new holiday and the laws enacted in past
sessions, <PERSON>Mrs. Reed</PERSON> said, ``We have the finest package of human
rights legislation in the nation.
   ``<PERSON>Richard Butler</PERSON> and his small band is just a pitiful bunch,''
she said. ``The Aryan Nations people are now moving into the states
of <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>.''
   The major opposition focused on the potential cost of another
day off for government workers, estimated anywhere between <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY>
and <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY> depending on whether payroll is considered, and
<PERSON>King</PERSON>'s radical political background.
   <PERSON>Andrus</PERSON> said, however, that ``more than a holiday to honor one
man, it will be a day to honor all like him, who believe that no
person can truly be free when even one other person is denied
liberty.''

CITY CELEBRATES KING'S BIRTHDAY, ITS DIVERSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The spirit of <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr.</ORGANIZATION> descended on Parcher Plaza -- the heart of 
civic <LOCATION>Glendale</LOCATION> -- for the first time <DATE>Monday</DATE>, as about 80 city officials and 
employees celebrated the 61st birthday of the slain civil rights leader with an 
outdoor party. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. <PERSON>David Scott</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>North Glendale United Methodist Church</ORGANIZATION> delivered a 
speech, calling for continued progress toward racial unity and citing <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s 
famous "I Have a Dream" address. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Glendale High School Chamber Choir</ORGANIZATION> opened the festivities with a soulful 
rendition of the national anthem and entertained the crowd after the speech. 
Volunteers served free turkey and ham sandwiches and potato and macaroni salad, 
and Mayor <PERSON>Jerold Milner</PERSON> read a proclamation. 
</P>
<P>
In many respects, the celebration mirrored hundreds of King festivities around 
the country. But for at least one <LOCATION>Glendale</LOCATION> minority employee, it was a special 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years ago it was uncomfortable for minorities to come into this city at 
any time, particularly in the evenings," said <ORGANIZATION>Glendale Community Relations</ORGANIZATION> 
Coordinator <PERSON>Rick Reyes</PERSON>, who has worked for the city for 29 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Even today there are pockets of resistance, but the attitudes are slowly 
changing." 
</P>
<P>
As recently as three years ago, a black delicatessen owner left town after 
attacks by vandals who repeatedly smeared her store with racist graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
In past years, the city quietly recognized <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s day with a proclamation and a 
lunchtime movie in the basement of city hall.

A HOLIDAY FOR ALL TO SHARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This year, five years after <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> created a national holiday on <DATE>Jan. 15</DATE> to 
commemorate <PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON>'s birthday, only four of 29 Orange County 
cities -- and the county itself -- have officially recognized the day and its 
meaning. At the rate additional cities join in, it will be well into the 21st 
Century before the holiday is given its just due. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> made the birthday of the slain civil rights leader a holiday because 
he stood for justice and equality for all races. Those who lived through the 
days when King led nonviolent demonstrations to force the white society to come 
face to face with its own racism will never forget the role this eloquent and 
peaceful man played in national change. But, while the most virulent forms of 
racism have disappeared, there are still gains to be made for blacks in 
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION>. As an indication of the non-acceptance of blacks 
here, their numbers have remained virtually stagnant for a decade, still 
numbering less than 30,000 of a population of more than <MONEY>2 million</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Day</ORGANIZATION> is not just for blacks. It also represents 
the struggle for equality of all people who come to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> in search of 
freedom. In <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION>, this includes large communities of Vietnamese 
refugees and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, <ORGANIZATION>Seal Beach</ORGANIZATION> added <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Day</ORGANIZATION> to its list of employee 
holidays. The year before, <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION> joined the cities of <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Huntington 
Beach</LOCATION>, as well as <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION>, to celebrate the symbolic day. During this 
coming year, other cities should join with them so that, well before the turn 
of the century, it is a holiday observed by all in <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr.</ORGANIZATION> was remembered in church services
nationwide <DATE>Sunday</DATE> on the eve of what would have been his <DATE>61st
birthday</DATE>, and the slain civil rights leader's widow called on
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to help unify <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>.
   Coretta <PERSON>Scott King</PERSON> delivered her annual ``state of the dream''
address at <ORGANIZATION>Ebenezer Baptist Church</ORGANIZATION>, where her husband was pastor,
before about 1,000 people, including such civil rights leaders as
the Revs. <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Joseph Lowery</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON> reflected on the dramatic social changes of <DATE>1989</DATE> in
other parts of the world and her husband's philosophy of civil
disobedience.
   ``The cataclysmic changes we have seen in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>, in
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> since last year have deep roots in this
very pulpit,'' she said.
   <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON>, noting that <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> is to deliver his State of the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION>
address in a few days, recalled a State of the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> speech in the
<DATE>1960s</DATE> by then-President <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>.
   Johnson ``captured the imagination of the American people just
by saying three little words, `We shall overcome,''' <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON> said.
   ``A quarter of a century later, President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has the same
opportunity,'' she said. ``He can help unify <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> if he will
break with the past by ending the arms race and working for
programs to provide jobs and educational opportunities for all
Americans.
   ``If he will avoid the kind of military entanglements that
destroyed (<ORGANIZATION>Johnson</ORGANIZATION>'s) war on poverty, he can unify <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> and lead
the world to a higher destiny,'' <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Jack Kemp</PERSON>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> secretary of housing and urban development,
presented <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON> with a large photograph of a Chinese student
standing in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Tiananmen Square</LOCATION> holding a sign reading, ``We
Shall Overcome.''
   ``The dream lives on not only here, but throughout the world,''
<PERSON>Kemp</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON> called on <ORGANIZATION>King</ORGANIZATION> supporters to carry on her husband's
dream.
   ``Let's be clear that the future depends on us and our
determination to do God's will,'' she said. ``If you take nothing
else away from here today, let it be a conviction that you can make
a difference.''
   Earlier, <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>, a former Democratic presidential contender and
former King aide, spoke to textile workers in <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>central
Georgia</LOCATION> from the steps of the <ORGANIZATION>Jefferson County Courthouse</ORGANIZATION> within
sight of an old slave auction block.
   He urged all workers to stand up against their bosses for a
living wage and decent working conditions.
   ``As long as the plug is pulled and the lights are out, we're
all the same in the dark,'' <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> said. ``Regardless of color,
hunger hurts.''
   In <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON>, the first black to hold
that office, told about 400 people at <ORGANIZATION>Judson Memorial Church</ORGANIZATION> about
<PERSON>King</PERSON>'s struggle for equality and the need to continue.
   ``<PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON> took us to the dawn of a new era,'' <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> said.
``It is up to us to push on into the bright light of day.
   ``<PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON> dreamed of an inclusive society, where people would
be judged by their good will and their good deeds,'' he said.
``That is my dream for our city.''
   In <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Roman Catholic Bishop Anthony M. Pilla</PERSON> presided at
an afternoon prayer service at <ORGANIZATION>St. John's Cathedral</ORGANIZATION>.
   The Rev. <PERSON>Howard Moody</PERSON>, senior minister at <ORGANIZATION>Judson Memorial</ORGANIZATION>,
expressed concern at <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s service that <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s dream had not
been fulfilled.
   Racial strife shows that the ``dream has been deferred and we
haven't lived up to the promise,'' said <PERSON>Moody</PERSON>, who is white.
   ``Racism and prejudice is still alive and well in this country
despite everything he did,'' <ORGANIZATION>Moody</ORGANIZATION> said. ``I don't think white
people have lived up to what he hoped we would. He was betting
everything on us. He bet his life, finally, that we would change.''
   King, the son of an <LOCATION>Atlanta Baptist</LOCATION> minister, led non-violent
marches in the South in the <DATE>1950s</DATE> and <DATE>1960s</DATE> in a quest to end
discrimination against blacks and other minorities. He was
assassinated on <DATE>April 4, 1968</DATE>, in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn</LOCATION>.
   King's teachings were honored <DATE>Sunday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> as about 100 to
150 Haitian exiles staged a peaceful demonstration for democracy in
their <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> island nation. Demonstrators called for a halt in
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> aid to Gen. <PERSON>Prosper Avril</PERSON>'s government and that <PERSON>Avril</PERSON>, on a
trade mission to <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>, be kept from returning home.
   For the first time, the holiday falls this year on <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s actual
birthday, <DATE>Jan. 15</DATE>. There were plans in all 50 states and 144 other
countries for bells to ring and for a moment of silence in honor of
King at <TIME>12:30 p.m. EST</TIME>. The <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> also planned to
pause, and the <ORGANIZATION>Liberty Bell</ORGANIZATION> was to ring in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, hundreds of volunteers, including
Mayor <PERSON>Tom Bradley</PERSON>, planted nearly 400 <ORGANIZATION>Canary Island Pine</ORGANIZATION> trees
along a seven-mile stretch of <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Boulevard</ORGANIZATION>.
   At a banquet in <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s honor at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Kansas</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Lawrence</LOCATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, <PERSON>Martin Luther King III</PERSON> said his father's
dream is a long way from reality.
   ``The reality is that time has not arrived,'' <PERSON>King</PERSON> said. ``We
still have a long way to go ... to try to achieve his unfinished
work, to create a world where freedom, justice and equality becomes
reality to all mankind.''
   King said black enrollment in colleges has been declining, and
that black people are still denied advancement in business.
   King's birthday became the 10th national holiday in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   Forty-six states and the federal government mark the holiday.
The four states that do not recognize the federal holiday are
<LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>. Wyoming is observing the
holiday this year only.
   <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>'s holiday is on hold, and the state faces more months of
debate before voters settle the controversy in <DATE>November</DATE>. It began
when former Democratic Gov. <PERSON>Bruce Babbitt</PERSON> declared a King holiday
by executive order in <DATE>1986</DATE> only to have it rescinded by his
successor, Republican <PERSON>Evan Mecham</PERSON>.
   According to a poll published by the <ORGANIZATION>Arizona Republic</ORGANIZATION> newspaper
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <PERCENT>71 percent</PERCENT> of those surveyed would vote to repeal a law
passed by the Legislature that would set a holiday for <ORGANIZATION>King</ORGANIZATION> and do
away with <ORGANIZATION>Columbus Day</ORGANIZATION>.
   But when <ORGANIZATION>Columbus Day</ORGANIZATION> was eliminated as an issue, <PERCENT>49 percent</PERCENT> of
the 808 respondents said they supported a King holiday in
principle, <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> opposed it and <PERCENT>11 percent</PERCENT> said they did not
know.
   In <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, a supporter of the <ORGANIZATION>King</ORGANIZATION> holiday there said
efforts to stop the referendum went against what King stood for.
   ``You have to remember <PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON>'s part of his movement was to
get people the right to vote so now that the `people' have said
`put it on the ballot' to circumvent them from voting would almost
go against some of the principles,'' said the Rev. <PERSON>Warren Stewart
Sr.</PERSON> ``So what we have to do is the more difficult task, and educate
people on why <PERSON>Martin King</PERSON> ought to have a holiday in <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>.''

<PERSON>Dennis Ulysees</PERSON>, 31, a stonemason from <LOCATION>Tacoma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>, stood in front of <ORGANIZATION>Martin 
Luther King Jr.</ORGANIZATION>'s resting place, his right arm wrapped around his daughter, 
<PERSON>Casandra</PERSON>, 10. Neither spoke for several minutes. Both just stood there gazing 
at the tomb. 
</P>
<P>
As they left, Ulysees explained he had brought his daughter to the <ORGANIZATION>Martin 
Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. National Historic Site so she could learn more about the slain 
civil rights leader. "I want her to know him, to know how important he was for 
black people like us," <PERSON>Ulysees</PERSON> said. "I want her to live her life with his life 
as a model." 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, <PERSON>Charlene Mitchell Rogers</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> television newscaster, 
appeared with her son, <PERSON>Jonathan</PERSON>, 8. "I came to <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> especially to visit the 
site," <PERSON>Rogers</PERSON> said. "I brought my son along because I believe it is essential 
he come here. 
</P>
<P>
"He has never known segregation," continued <PERSON>Rogers</PERSON>, 39. "He has grown up in a 
privileged environment. I want to make certain he knows who he is and where he 
came from, that this man was responsible for the freedoms he has. I don't want 
him ever to forget." 
</P>
<P>
Every day people gather here in the heart of <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>'s Sweet Auburn district to 
pay homage to <PERSON>King</PERSON>, who died <DATE>April 4, 1968</DATE>, in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, the victim of an 
assassin's bullet. But on this day, which would have been <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s <DATE>60th birthday</DATE>, 
thousands are expected to gather at the site's reflecting pool where his tomb 
is mounted on a pedestal. Inscribed on his crypt are <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s words: "Free at 
last. Free at last. Thank God Almighty I'm free at last." 
</P>
<P>
The two-block-long national historic site was set aside by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE> and 
has been administered since by the <ORGANIZATION>National Park Service</ORGANIZATION>. Its purpose is to 
protect and interpret for the benefit, inspiration and education of present and 
future generations the place where <PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON> was born, lived, 
worked and worshiped. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year 840,000 visitors came here, half black, half white," explained 
<PERSON>Randolph Scott</PERSON>, 58, a former <LOCATION>Norfolk</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, high school history teacher who has 
been the site's superintendent for the <DATE>last four years</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Among the site's points of interest: the home at 501 <LOCATION>Auburn Ave.</LOCATION> where <PERSON>King</PERSON> was 
born; his tomb a block away at the <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Center for 
<ORGANIZATION>Non-Violent Social Change</ORGANIZATION>, founded in <DATE>1968</DATE> and headed by his wife, <PERSON>Coretta 
Scott King</PERSON>; and <ORGANIZATION>Ebenezer Baptist Church</ORGANIZATION>, located two blocks from his 
birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Like Father, Grandfather 
</P>
<P>
His father, <PERSON>Martin Luther King Sr.</PERSON>, was pastor of the church from <DATE>1931</DATE> to <DATE>1975</DATE>; 
his grandfather, <PERSON>A. D. Williams</PERSON>, presided from <DATE>1894</DATE> to <DATE>1931</DATE>. <PERSON>Martin Luther King 
Jr.</PERSON> preached his first sermon at <ORGANIZATION>Ebenezer Baptist Church</ORGANIZATION> when he was 17 and 
served as co-pastor with his father from <DATE>1960</DATE> to <DATE>1968</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
It was there that his body lay in state and also where his mother, <PERSON>Alberta 
Williams King</PERSON>, was slain <DATE>six years later</DATE> as she played the organ during a 
religious service. 
</P>
<P>
At the two-story, 14-room Queen <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> clapboard home where King was born and 
lived until <DATE>1941</DATE>, visitors are taken on a tour by ranger <PERSON>Shelly Lewis</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people say they can feel <PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON>'s spirit, feel his presence in this 
house," said <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION>Bolton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Miss.</LOCATION> "Many visitors get quite emotional. 
They break down and cry." 
</P>
<P>
Also born there were his brother, <PERSON>A. D.</PERSON>, who drowned in a swimming pool 
accident in <DATE>1969</DATE>, and his sister, <PERSON>Christine King Farris</PERSON>, a professor at 
<LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Spelman College</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family Belongings 
</P>
<P>
The home contains the family's original furniture, including the piano King 
played as a boy, his baseball glove, Monopoly game, family icebox and washing 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
"Sweet <PERSON>Auburn</PERSON> was a mecca of <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>'s leading black business and commercial 
enterprises and a middle-class black residential area when <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON> 
lived here," site superintendent <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION>Park Service</ORGANIZATION> now owns 13 
turn-of-the-century homes and buildings in 21.5-acre site and plans to acquire 
27 more, he said. Seven have already been restored to their original state. 
</P>
<P>
Among the area's buildings is <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>'s famed <ORGANIZATION>Royal Peacock Club</ORGANIZATION> where <PERSON>Duke 
Ellington</PERSON>, <PERSON>Billy Eckstein</PERSON>, <PERSON>Louis Armstrong</PERSON> and other well-known black 
entertainers performed. <PERSON>John Wesley Dobbs</PERSON>, grandfather of former <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> Mayor 
<PERSON>Maynard H. Jackson</PERSON>, is credited with giving the area its nickname, Sweet 
Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
At the <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Center for <ORGANIZATION>Non-Violent Social Change</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Park 
Service</ORGANIZATION> operates a museum filled with memorabilia and photographs highlighting 
the life of the civil rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
On display are the Nobel Peace Prize he received as well as the Medal of 
Freedom, his clothing, clerical robes and favorite neckties. Behind glass is 
the key to Room 307 at the <LOCATION>Lorraine Hotel</LOCATION> where King was killed, the wallet he 
was carrying when shot, his handwritten sermons and well-worn Bible. 
</P>
<P>
"What is important to my mother, my brother and my two sisters is the 
ever-growing interest in my father and what he worked for in his lifetime," 
said <PERSON>Martin Luther King III</PERSON>, 31, a <LOCATION>Fulton County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, commissioner. "I hope

SOME WORKERS MUST MARK THE HOLIDAY ON THEIR OWN TIME 
</P>

Early <DATE>Monday</DATE> morning <PERSON>Zack Harmon</PERSON> called his workplace to say he would be out 
sick. Hours later, though, <PERSON>Harmon</PERSON> appeared to be in suspiciously good health. 
He stood with his 2-year-old son perched upon his shoulder and watched the 
<ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Day parade flow down <LOCATION>King Boulevard</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>South Los 
Angeles</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Like <PERSON>Harmon</PERSON>, many <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> workers and students were forced to feign illness 
or expend vacation days or accumulated time off <DATE>Monday</DATE> in order to participate 
in the observance of what would have been the civil rights leader's 61st 
birthday. Though the third <DATE>Monday</DATE> in <DATE>January</DATE> was designated a federal holiday 
honoring King in <DATE>1986</DATE>, many offices and some private schools still remained 
open. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon echoed the sentiments of other absentees who could be found along the 
parade route when he explained his decision not to report to work. It is 
important, he said, to commemorate a man and a movement that "changed the face 
of the whole nation. That's why I'm here and that's why he's here," he said, 
indicating his son, <PERSON>Michael</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Harmon</PERSON>, a financial analyst, said calling in sick was the only way he could get 
the day off, and that his employers were aware of the ruse and accepted it. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them I was sick, but they know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Others said their bosses are less benign. They described personal battles to 
persuade school officials and employees to recognize the day. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>M. Jeremy McCauley</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell Douglas</ORGANIZATION>, said he was was appalled 
when he read the latest company newsletter. Across the top ran a line in bold 
print informing employees that <DATE>Jan. 15</DATE> was to be "a regular working day." 
</P>
<P>
"I was burned up by that," he said. "The inference is that it is not as 
deserving as any other holiday . . . enough so that they put it in the 
newsletter." 
</P>
<P>
To observe the day, <PERSON>McCauley</PERSON> would have had to use a vacation day, a sick day 
or a personal day. He decided to report to work. 
</P>
<P>
"Here it's no big deal. It's no special day and I don't understand that. It 
shows little respect or concern for <PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON>." 
</P>
<P>
Incensed, <PERSON>McCauley</PERSON> already has begun writing a letter to the company newspaper 
detailing his feelings. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Don Hanson</PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell Douglas</ORGANIZATION>, said company holidays are 
negotiated with the union. 
</P>
<P>
"The company has 13 holidays a year and <ORGANIZATION>King Day</ORGANIZATION> is not one of those that they 
chose to put in, at least not so far," he said. Hanson also noted that many 
company holidays have been consolidated so employees have a week off from 
<LOCATION>Christmas</LOCATION> through New Year's. 
</P>
<P>
Other companies have given employees the option of using a floating holiday to 
observe the day. <PERSON>Barbara Hughes</PERSON>, an employee at <ORGANIZATION>Warner Brothers</ORGANIZATION>, used a 
floating holiday to observe King Day. But <PERSON>Hughes</PERSON> feels that is a way of 
sidestepping the issue. Going to the parade was her way of "making a 
statement." 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to maybe show management that we as employees at <ORGANIZATION>Warner Brothers</ORGANIZATION> should 
have (King Day) as a holiday," she said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Rob Friedman</PERSON>, company spokesman, said <PERSON>King</PERSON> Day was not a union holiday, so the 
studios were open. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Evelyn Brummell</PERSON>, a sales clerk at <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION>, used a personal day off she had saved. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave his life, so I can at least take one day," she said. 
</P>
<P>
To <PERSON>Elimu Kiongozi</PERSON>, an aerospace employee who could be found at work <DATE>Monday</DATE>, the 
sanctioning of the holiday by schools and officials is less important than 
African-Americans acknowledging the day. 
</P>
<P>
"We should just take the day off whether The Man is going to let us or not . . 
. even if it costs us," said <PERSON>Kiongozi</PERSON>, adding that other leaders like <PERSON>Malcolm</PERSON> X 
and <PERSON>Marcus Garvey</PERSON> should have days of commemoration in the African-American 
community as well. 
</P>
<P>
While the holiday was observed by public schools and universities, some 
students of private schools found themselves engaged in the controversy over 
observing the day. 
</P>
<P>
For example, at <ORGANIZATION>Occidental College</ORGANIZATION>, classes were held <DATE>Monday</DATE>, but many of the 
school's students chose to attend an anti-apartheid rally at the <ORGANIZATION>South African 
Consulate</ORGANIZATION> as a way of observing <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s birthday. 
</P>
<P>
A candlelight vigil was held <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> as the students' first organized 
attempt to convince the administration that the day should be a school holiday. 
<PERSON>Frances Hill</PERSON>, the school's news director, said <ORGANIZATION>Occidental</ORGANIZATION> is on the quarter 
system and does not observe other holidays such as President's Day. The 
school's administration is sympathetic to the request of students to observe 
the day, she added.

ECHOES OF STRIFE HAUNT U.S. ON KING'S BIRTHDAY

<P>
Church bells across the country tolled the loss of <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr.</ORGANIZATION> today 
as echoes of the racial conflicts the slain civil rights leader struggled to 
overcome continued to haunt the nation. 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, worshipers at <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s church were urged on the slain civil rights 
leader's birthday to keep alive his memory and his philosophy of nonviolence. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a man who is a deep current in our memory," said the Rev. <PERSON>Cecil 
Williams</PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION>Glide Memorial United Methodist Church</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. 
"Let us live then not only his dream, but let us live the practice of 
nonviolence and unconditional love." 
</P>
<P>
Williams spoke at the annual ecumenical service at <ORGANIZATION>Ebenezer Baptist Church</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Church services, parades and other celebrations were held nationwide during the 
weekend before the federal holiday, which for the first time falls on the slain 
civil-rights leader's actual birthday. 
</P>
<P>
He would have been 61 today. 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON>Tom Bradley</PERSON> observed the holiday today by ringing the 
<ORGANIZATION>City Hall</ORGANIZATION> bell three times. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Southern Christian Leadership Conference</ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, demonstrated at the 
downtown headquarters of <ORGANIZATION>Security Pacific Bank</ORGANIZATION> to protest the bank's decision 
to stay open on the federal holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Also planned today in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> was a "March of Celebration" parade, being 
televised nationally for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
This year's holiday follows a series of bombings and threats, apparently 
racially motivated, in the Southeast, and a flare-up of racial tensions in 
<LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> after an apparent hoax in which a white man had claimed that a black 
mugger fatally shot his pregnant wife. 
</P>
<P>
It also comes at a time of gains for blacks -- the election of <PERSON>David N. 
Dinkins</PERSON>, first black mayor of <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>, and the nation's first elected 
black governor, <PERSON>L. Douglas Wilder</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, the sound of liberty is being heard all around the world," said <PERSON>James 
Farmer</PERSON>, founder of the <ORGANIZATION>Congress for Racial Equality</ORGANIZATION>, as he pounded three times 
with his fist on the <ORGANIZATION>Liberty Bell</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>. "Those who have been denied 
liberty love it most. Dr. King loved liberty and he fought and died for it." 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> held a moment of silence at noon. 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, one of just four states without some form of King holiday, 
thousands marched in <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION> today to honor King. A racially mixed 
crowd carried black balloons along a four-mile stretch of downtown <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> as 
they headed for a rally at the <ORGANIZATION>Capitol</ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON>, a day away from his party's
presidential nomination, invoked the memory of <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King
Jr</ORGANIZATION>. <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> and pledged to work to ``inspire and uplift this
country.''
   The <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> Democrat and his designated running mate,
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> <PERSON>Sen. Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON>, received a tour of the <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King
Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Center from the civil rights leader's widow, <PERSON>Coretta Scott King</PERSON>.
   Earlier, <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON>Kitty</PERSON>, and adviser <PERSON>Paul Brountas</PERSON> had
breakfast in the candidate's hotel suite with <ORGANIZATION>AFL-CIO</ORGANIZATION> president
<PERSON>Lane Kirkland</PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON>Irena</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>' aides, sensitive to accusations that labor wields too
much influence in the Democratic Party, did not list the breakfast
session on his schedule.
   An <ORGANIZATION>AFL-CIO</ORGANIZATION> spokesman called the breakfast ``routine.''
   ``I'm sure what they talked about was how to win in <DATE>November</DATE>,''
said federation spokesman <PERSON>Rex Hardesty</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> was spending most of the day in his suite working with
speechwriter <PERSON>Bill Woodward</PERSON> on the address he will deliver <DATE>Thursday</DATE>
when he accepts the presidential nomination.
   He met for nearly an hour with the Democrats' Hispanic members
of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, a meeting they said <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> asked for. Rep. <PERSON>Albert
Bustamante</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> said they talked about involving Hispanics in
the campaign and in the transition team, if <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> is elected.
   ``He wanted to establish a dialogue with the leadership of the
Hispanic community in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON>Bustamante</PERSON>. ``We were real
pleased.''
   While the convention wound up its debate on the platform,
<PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> attended a closed fund-raiser in a downtown office
building. Accompanying the <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> governor was his cousin,
Academy Award-winning actress <PERSON>Olympia Dukakis</PERSON>.
   The last threat to convention unity was resolved earlier in the
day with announcement that aides to <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON> had
reached agreement on most platform differences.
   With <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON> leading the way, <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> and their
wives looked at exhibits at the <ORGANIZATION>King Center</ORGANIZATION>.
   The first one they stopped at contained mementos of the passage
of legislation establishing a national holiday commemorating <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s
birthday, <DATE>Jan. 15</DATE>.
   One of the exhibits was a photograph of President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> signing
the legislation. It included an inscription, ``To Coretta King.
With respect and high esteem on a very special day.'' It was
signed, ``<PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>.''
   The Republican vice president is <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>' certain opponent in
the fall election.
   Other exhibits included the key to Room 307 at the <PERSON>Lorraine
Motel</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn</LOCATION>. King was standing on the balcony outside
that room when he was shot and killed in <DATE>1968</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Nobel Peace Prize</ORGANIZATION>, awarded to King, as well as the
Presidential Medal of Freedom, awarded him posthumously, also were
displayed.
   The final stop on the tour was <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s tomb, inscribed, ``Rev.
<PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON> <DATE>1929</DATE> - <DATE>1968</DATE>. Free at last, Free at last,
<ORGANIZATION>Thank God</ORGANIZATION> almighty I'm free at last.''
   In a brief speech that included several quotations from <LOCATION>King</LOCATION>,
<PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> described the slain civil rights leader as ``a man of
action, he was a man of inspiration.''
   <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> was nearby, and <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> said that if elected he and his
vice president ``are going to do our very best, with your support,
to inspire and uplift this country.''
   Dukakis praised the convention keynote speech by <ORGANIZATION>Texas State</ORGANIZATION>
Treasurer <PERSON>Ann Richards</PERSON> and noted that neither he nor <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> ``have
ever won any blue ribbons for great oratory.''
   Then he added, ``And after <PERSON>Jesse</PERSON> gets through tonight, none of
us will meet the standard <PERSON>Ann Richards</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON> set for
this convention.''
   <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> was the featured convention speaker <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.

   <PERSON>James Meredith</PERSON>, whose enrollment as
the first black at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Mississippi</ORGANIZATION> sparked rioting in
<DATE>1962</DATE>, now is fighting white liberals instead of white supremacists.
   ``I was engaged in a war and the only thing that has changed is
the enemy,'' <PERSON>Meredith</PERSON> told reporters <DATE>Sunday</DATE> on the eve of the
national holiday honoring slain civil rights leader <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther
King Jr</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``When we went to <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> my enemy was the white
supremacists. My enemy now is the white liberal.''
   His enrollment at <LOCATION>Ole Miss</LOCATION> resulted in riots that were
suppressed by federal troops. But he since has called integration
``the biggest con job ever pulled on anybody.''
   Meredith said he never considered himself a part of the
civil-rights movement.
   ``That's always been an insult to me,'' he said.
   Meredith blamed many of society's ills on a ``liberal elite,''
which he said wants to keep blacks in a second-class position under
the pretext of helping them.
   Meredith surprised civil-rights activists in <DATE>September</DATE> when he
went to work as an adviser to arch-conservative <PERSON>Sen. Jesse Helms</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>R-N.C.</LOCATION>,
   Since <PERSON>Helms</PERSON>' election to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1972</DATE>, he has vigorously
opposed civil-rights legislation and other domestic programs
favored by many blacks.
   Meredith, speaking to reporters before an address at <ORGANIZATION>Mount
Holyoke College</ORGANIZATION>, had little to say about King or <PERSON>Helms</PERSON>' opposition
to creating of the <ORGANIZATION>King</ORGANIZATION> holiday.
   ``The issue is not about <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON>'s birthday being a
national holiday,'' he said. ``The issue is about the <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther
King</ORGANIZATION> holiday commission.''
   Helms has opposed funding for the federal commission <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>
set up to promote the holiday. He says establishing such a
commission for one individual sets a bad precedent.

<TEXT>
   The youngest son of slain civil rights leader
<ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr.</ORGANIZATION> has resigned as president of the center that
carries his father's name amid talk of a rift among the leadership
over the center's direction.
   <PERSON>Dexter King</PERSON>'s resignation was announced <DATE>Thursday</DATE> by the <ORGANIZATION>Martin
Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Center for <ORGANIZATION>Nonviolent Social Change</ORGANIZATION>, but no reason
was given.
   Civil rights leaders in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> said <PERSON>King</PERSON> stepped down because
of conflicts over fiscal and personnel concerns, and there were
reports of a rift between <PERSON>King</PERSON> and his mother, <PERSON>Coretta Scott King</PERSON>.
   <LOCATION>Atlanta City</LOCATION> Councilman <PERSON>Hosea Williams</PERSON> said the center was
encroaching on the leadership position in the civil rights movement
of the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Christian Leadership Conference</ORGANIZATION>, which the elder
King founded.
   ``The center's purpose was to perpetuate the legacy of <PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON>,
but not to carry on the whole movement,'' said <PERSON>Williams</PERSON>, a former
lieutenant of the elder King. ``When they started talking about
leading the movement, freeing black folk, they started competing,
and both got hurt.''
   Mayor <PERSON>Andrew Young</PERSON>, who was an aide to the elder King in the
'60s, was quoted by <ORGANIZATION>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</ORGANIZATION> as saying the
resignation was part of a family dispute fueled by a generation gap.
   A King Center official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON> might return to the presidency she relinquished to
her son.
   The <ORGANIZATION>King Center</ORGANIZATION> is a non-profit organization devoted to
education about <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s teachings and philosophy. It also urges
action on international racial issues, especially apartheid in
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, and is host to the annual <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr.</ORGANIZATION>
birthday week celebration.
   The <ORGANIZATION>SCLC</ORGANIZATION> has taken an activist approach to the problems of
poverty and racism since it was founded in <DATE>1957</DATE> by King and the
Revs. <PERSON>Joseph Lowery</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ralph Abernathy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Fred Shuttlesworth</PERSON>.
   ``We are the activist arm of the movement,'' <PERSON>Lowery</PERSON> has said.
``When you do that, you step on toes and you don't become the most
popular kid on the block.''
   The Rev. <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON>, a follower of King in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> and a
former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, said
in a telephone interview from <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> that the two groups are
complementary rather than competitive.
   ``The fact that <PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON> remains a frame of reference for
justice is mainly that his work has been institutionalized,''
<PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> said, referring to the center.
   ``The <ORGANIZATION>SCLC</ORGANIZATION>'s legacy (is) direct action, challenging the racism,
challenging anti-semitism,'' he added.
   <PERSON>Dexter King</PERSON>, 28, was elected in <DATE>January</DATE> to take over from his
mother, who remained as chief executive officer. He said he wanted
to cut the center's dependency on donations and put it on a solid
financial base so it could ``market and disseminate'' non-violent
teachings.
   King could not be reached at the office of his business,
<ORGANIZATION>Visionary Development Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
   In a statement from the <ORGANIZATION>King Center</ORGANIZATION>, board Chairman <PERSON>Jesse Hill
Jr.</PERSON> did not address the reasons for <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s decision.
   ``It must be borne in mind that the changing circumstances,
staff and management changes and tragic assassinations have not
changed this eternal commitment to social change through creative
love and revolutionary non-violence,'' Hill wrote.
   The King Center, on <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>'s historic <LOCATION>Auburn Avenue</LOCATION>, contains a
museum and <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr.</ORGANIZATION>'s tomb.

   The ouster of <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Evan Mecham</PERSON>, who
canceled a state holiday honoring civil rights crusader <PERSON>Martin
Luther King Jr.</PERSON>, was cheered by hundreds at a banquet commemorating
<PERSON>King</PERSON>'s assassination 20 years ago.
   <ORGANIZATION>Southern Christian Leadership Conference</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Joseph Lowery</PERSON>
announced <PERSON>Mecham</PERSON>'s conviction by the <ORGANIZATION>Arizona Senate</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Monday</DATE> at the
awards dinner that night.
   About 750 people cheered and applauded as the civil rights
anthem, ``We Shall Overcome,'' played softly in the background.
   ``I hate to rejoice,'' <PERSON>Lowery</PERSON> said, ``but I feel good about this
... We did overcome. Justice has been served.''
   Mecham was removed from office 20 years to the day that <PERSON>King</PERSON>,
who founded the <ORGANIZATION>SCLC</ORGANIZATION>, was shot to death in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn</LOCATION>.
   Mayor <PERSON>Andrew Young</PERSON>, an aide to King and an ordained
Congregationalist minister, reacted to the news with a Bible verse:
``Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.''
   In <LOCATION>Altamont</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, meanwhile, where <PERSON>Mecham</PERSON> grew up, his removal
from office was lamented by relatives and some old acquaintances.
   ``It's just a dirty deal and Mafia-headed. He has just been
blackballed. I think it's disgusting,'' said his cousin <ORGANIZATION>Ona</ORGANIZATION> Rust of
<LOCATION>Altamont</LOCATION>. ``I'm very disappointed in the people of <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>.''
   Mecham graduated from <ORGANIZATION>Altamont High School</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1942</DATE> and moved
away after joining the service in <DATE>1943</DATE>. He is scheduled to address
the high school's commencement ceremony <DATE>May 27</DATE>.
   A former classmate, <LOCATION>Beverly Fieldsted</LOCATION>, who was one year behind
<PERSON>Mecham</PERSON> in high school, said <PERSON>Mecham</PERSON>'s removal must stem from a
misunderstanding and the former governor is innocent.
   Mecham canceled a King holiday for state workers on <DATE>Jan. 12,
1987</DATE>, angering civil rights leaders and triggering a boycott by
some organizations that had planned conventions and by some rock
groups.
   He went on to anger blacks, Jews, women and homosexuals with
official actions or offhand remarks.
   Among other things, he defended the use of the word
``pickaninny'' for black children.
   ``I think Gov. <PERSON>Mecham</PERSON> exhibited insensitivity, a corruption of
spirit,'' <PERSON>Lowery</PERSON> said in an interview. ``I think it had to be a
corruption of spirit in order to insult <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King</ORGANIZATION> and the
birthday holiday which the nation wanted to honor.''
   King's widow, <PERSON>Coretta Scott King</PERSON>, stood thoughtfully after being
told of <PERSON>Mecham</PERSON>'s impeachment, and declined to comment.
   The <ORGANIZATION>SCLC</ORGANIZATION> dinner was held to present the group's annual <ORGANIZATION>Martin
Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Memorial Drum Major for <ORGANIZATION>Justice Awards</ORGANIZATION>.

RACE RELATIONS: PAST SNUBS OF MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. HAVE MADE AMERICA'S FINEST

Less than two weeks ago, the best way to define the Yiddish word chutzpah was 
to tell the story about the child who did away with his parents, then appealed 
for leniency because he was an orphan. 
</P>
<P>
But on <DATE>Nov. 7</DATE>, the kid was outdone by <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>Maureen O'Connor</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>San 
Diego Chargers</ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON>Alex Spanos</PERSON> and the entire <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Super Bowl Task 
Force</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
When the <ORGANIZATION>National Football League</ORGANIZATION> moved to shift the <DATE>1993</DATE> Super Bowl out of 
<LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> after <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> voters rejected a referendum establishing a state holiday 
on <PERSON>Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON>'s birthday, <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> leaders, ignoring our 
city's shameful behavior concerning the slain civil rights leader, appealed to 
the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> to award the big game to <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Now, that's chutzpah. 
</P>
<P>
Let's examine the track record of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Finest City</LOCATION> over the <DATE>last several 
years</DATE>, beginning in <DATE>1986</DATE> when the <LOCATION>San Diego City Council</LOCATION>, in a highly 
controversial move, changed the name of Market Street to <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King 
Way</ORGANIZATION>. Almost immediately, a coalition arose to reverse the decision. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>November, 1987</DATE>, <LOCATION>San Diegans</LOCATION> voted overwhelmingly to strip <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s name off 
the downtown thoroughfare and return the original name. 
</P>
<P>
The council then revived the issue by announcing that it was looking for 
another way to honor King. It voted to name the city's new waterfront 
convention center for him and called on the <ORGANIZATION>Port Commission</ORGANIZATION> to agree. 
</P>
<P>
The move seemed assured because the city's three appointees to the commission, 
plus <ORGANIZATION>National City</ORGANIZATION>'s representative, said publicly that they would comply. 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Dan Larsen</PERSON>, one of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>'s three appointees, changed his mind and 
switched his vote, scuttling another tribute to King. 
</P>
<P>
The bitter feelings about the whole ugly incident had subsided until <DATE>two days 
before Election Day</DATE>, when a television sportscaster told the world that Super 
Bowl XXVII might be moved to another site unless Arizonans voted in favor of 
the King holiday referendum. 
</P>
<P>
The threat revived the possibility that <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, a loser in the bidding for 
the <DATE>1993</DATE> Super Bowl, might get another shot at the game and affected the 
<LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> election, some believe. 
</P>
<P>
"Until that moment," said <PERSON>Bill Shover</PERSON>, a leading supporter of the King measure, 
"we had a <PERCENT>14%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>18%</PERCENT> lead. But then came that <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> report and people here felt 
threatened. There's a lot of <PERSON>Barry Goldwater</PERSON> attitude in this state. 
Independence. Frontier independence." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Terry Hudgins</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Better America Committee</ORGANIZATION>, 
added, "I think <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s report held a gun to the collective head of the 
<LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> electorate, which turned around and told them what to do with the Super 
Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
The day after the polls closed and the "nays" won by less than <PERCENT>1%</PERCENT> of the 1.1 
million votes cast, the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> appeal, in the form of a letter from 
<PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON>, was sent to <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> commissioner <PERSON>Paul Tagliabue</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> isn't alone. The Rose Bowl, another runner-up to <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> in the 
competition for Super Bowl XXVII, also wants to host the game. But as far as I 
know, <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> hasn't insulted <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s memory the way <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> has. 
</P>
<P>
So far, there's no telling how this will end or where the <DATE>January, 1993</DATE>, game 
will eventually be played. 
</P>
<P>
What does matter is that <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> was hypocritical enough to even suggest that 
this particular game be moved here. 
</P>
<P>
I'm a loyal <LOCATION>San Diegan</LOCATION> and Charger fan. The money and national exposure that 
the game would bring -- Super Bowl XXII generated <MONEY>$125 million</MONEY> here in <DATE>1988</DATE> -- 
would be good for the city. I would love nothing more than to see another Super 
Bowl game played here. 
</P>
<P>
But not this game. <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> doesn't deserve The Chutzpah Bowl any more than 
the newly orphaned child deserved leniency. 
</P>
<P>
Like <PERSON>Tagliabue</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gene Upshaw</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>NFL Players Assn.</ORGANIZATION>, I 
don't believe that the Super Bowl should be played in a state that has formally 
rejected naming a holiday for King. 
</P>
<P>
And in much the same way, football would be making a horrible mistake if it 
awards the <DATE>1993</DATE> game to a city that has consistently bent over backward not to 
honor this man who sought to achieve full civil rights for all.

<HEAD>Idaho Legislature Approves King Holiday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A holiday honoring <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr.</ORGANIZATION>
won final approval in the Legislature on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, making <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> the
47th state agreeing to adopt the federal holiday.
   Senate passage of the measure on a 28-11 vote assured it of
becoming law with Gov. <PERSON>Cecil Andrus</PERSON>' promised approval.
   The vote was one of the <ORGANIZATION>Legislature</ORGANIZATION>'s last acts before
adjourning for the year, and came four years after the state
designated the third <DATE>Monday</DATE> in <DATE>January</DATE> as a commemorative day but
not an official holiday for <ORGANIZATION>King</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> also have refused to
designate a holiday.
   ``We've come a long way down the road,'' <PERSON>Sen. Mary Lou Reed</PERSON>
said. ``We have the finest package of human rights legislation in
the nation.''
   The Legislature has passed some of the toughest laws in the
nation against racial harassment and discrimination. But the King
holiday, after winning initial <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> passage, was sidetracked in
the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>.
   Final passage came when the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> agreed to a <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> amendment
to call the holiday <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr.-Idaho Human Rights Day</ORGANIZATION>.
   A black community leader, the Rev. <PERSON>Ellis Robinson</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>St. Paul
Baptist Church</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Boise</LOCATION>, said the action extended the holiday
beyond King to ``anyone who's ever struggled and worked for the
rights of others.''
   ``We're not looking at this as a victory for black people,''
<PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> said. ``We're looking at it as a victory for all people.''
   The King holiday was pushed by lawmakers and the governor in
part to offset the negative image the state has developed because
of the presence of white supremacists at the <ORGANIZATION>Aryan Nations</ORGANIZATION> compound
of <PERSON>Richard Butler</PERSON> in the state's panhandle.
   The major opposition focused on the potential cost of another
day off for government workers, estimated anywhere between <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY>
and <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY>, depending on whether payroll is considered.

<TEXT>     <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON>Gerald McCarthy</PERSON> said late <DATE>Monday</DATE> that police had
no suspects in the slaying. Although three young men were taken into custody
at the scene, <PERSON>McCarthy</PERSON> said they were released after questioning.;    <PERSON>McCarthy</PERSON>
said an argument between two groups of young men apparently preceded the <TIME>2:15
p.m.</TIME> killing. But he said it was unclear whether <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> was part of the
argument. Miller, he said, was shot once in the chest.;    Later in the day,
<LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> police delayed the departure of two southbound trains while
searching the <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Day Freedom Train</ORGANIZATION> for youths who had robbed
another youth of his coat at gunpoint.;    <PERSON>McCarthy</PERSON> said the robbery report
was not linked to the shooting at the Civic Auditorium.;    Capt. <PERSON>Michael
Yarov</PERSON> and a team of at least 10 officers escorted three young men into custody
just before <TIME>5 p.m.</TIME> at the CalTrain station at Fourth and <PERSON>Townsend</PERSON> streets.;   
According to police, the robbery victim, who was not injured, got off the
train in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and told officials that a group of youths held him at
gunpoint and took his coat.;    The violence came on a day when people at the
rally repeatedly expressed the wish for peace so often echoed by King.;    At
the day's start, at the <ORGANIZATION>Cahill Station</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, the air was charged with
enthusiasm and anticipation as thousands gathered to board the sixth annual
Freedom Train bound for <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and a celebration of <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s birthday.;  
 "I'm here because this is one way I can find out about my culture," said
<PERSON>Malinda West</PERSON>, a senior at <ORGANIZATION>St. Andrew High.</ORGANIZATION>;    Among the estimated 5,000
aboard the train was 11-year-old <PERSON>Jimmy Cates</PERSON>, a sixth-grader from <PERSON>Bret Harte</PERSON>
Junior High School in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> who had recently written a biography on the
civil rights leader.;    "I want to hear people talk about <PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON>," he
said.;    It was the fifth Freedom Train ride for 81-year-old <PERSON>Veronica Jesse</PERSON>
of <LOCATION>San Jose.</LOCATION>;    "It's like a little vacation for me," said the petite senior
citizen who leans slightly and walks with a cane.;    <PERSON>Jesse</PERSON> and the other
riders were greeted by the Rev. <PERSON>Martin Grizzel</PERSON> at the Civic Auditorium.;   
"Brother <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> is shining down on us right now, and he is applauding us from
another land right now," he said to the 5,000 people who packed the
auditorium. About 1,000 others stayed outside the auditorium.;    Most of
those at the celebration had taken part in an orderly march through city
streets, and many marchers carried signs calling for an end to war in the
<LOCATION>Persian Gulf.</LOCATION>;    <PERSON>Jesse</PERSON> was accompanied by 11-year-old <PERSON>Nicole King</PERSON> and her
mother, <PERSON>Pam Burrell</PERSON>. Both were part of a community group called PACE, designed
to aid the elderly, and had been assigned to help <PERSON>Jesse</PERSON> along the trip. "I
like taking care of people," said <PERSON>Nicole</PERSON>, as she sipped a lemon-lime soda.;   
Only the news that the teen had been shot during the celebration seemed to
dampen her enthusiasm as she shook her head slowly.;    "It's too bad. It's a
pity," said <PERSON>Burrell</PERSON>. She said they heard nothing of the commotion that took
place upstairs where the shooting had occurred.;    The turnout at <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION>'s sixth annual official observance of <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s birthday was one of the
largest in the country. In <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, more than 500 people took part in a march
and rally.;    The <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> march began in the predominantly black Bay
View-Hunters Point area, with about 2,000 participants. Marchers walked four
miles to the railroad station to meet the Freedom Train riders, then headed
six blocks on Market Street to the auditorium.;    Organizers said the <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION> march was primarily dedicated to <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s life, but others broadened
the focus to include statements against the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> war.;    In contrast
to last week's spirited anti-war demonstrations during which participants
occasionally clashed violently with police, the march proceeded peacefully
with about a dozen officers on motorcycles and four or five squad cars
escorting the crowd.  </TEXT>

CALIFORNIA 94 RENAMED TO HONOR MARTIN LUTHER KING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 10-mile stretch of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 94, from downtown <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> to its interchange 
with <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 125 in <LOCATION>La Mesa</LOCATION>, was formally christened <DATE>Monday</DATE> as the <ORGANIZATION>Martin 
Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Four green-and-white signs, each 14 feet long by 3 1/2 feet wide, along the 
state route were unveiled <DATE>Monday</DATE> at a press conference officially acknowledging 
the name change, <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>'s latest effort to find a permanent memorial for the 
slain civil-rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
For two years, the memorial issue has thrust the city in a racially and 
politically divisive debate. The renaming of the freeway has been one of the 
least favorite choices of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>'s black community. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. <PERSON>George Stevens</PERSON>, a black community leader who has fought to have the 
<ORGANIZATION>San Diego Convention Center</ORGANIZATION> named for King, said at the unveiling that, 
although he supports renaming the freeway, he isn't satisfied, and that <LOCATION>San 
Diego</LOCATION> must still deal with what he called racism and oppression. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>April, 1986</DATE>, the <LOCATION>San Diego City Council</LOCATION> decided against seeking a name 
change for <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 94 and instead voted to designate Market Street as <ORGANIZATION>Martin 
Luther King Way</ORGANIZATION>. But, a year later, <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> voters rescinded that decision by 
overwhelmingly approving a referendum that restored Market Street. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath, a private group, led by members of the <ORGANIZATION>Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION>, 
worked with black leaders to find another replacement, settling on a 
scholarship fund and King statue to be built in <LOCATION>Balboa Park</LOCATION>. Fund raising for 
the <MONEY>$750,000</MONEY> goal has stalled at about <MONEY>$150,000</MONEY>, civic leaders said recently. 
</P>
<P>
Also attempting to move ahead was the <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION>, which called on the <ORGANIZATION>Board 
of Port Commissioners</ORGANIZATION> to name the new convention center in <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s honor, a 
recommendation pushed by the <ORGANIZATION>King Tribute Advisory Board</ORGANIZATION>. The group held a 
series of eight poorly attended public hearings before voting on its 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
By <DATE>last July</DATE>, the port board decided by a 4-3 vote to keep <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s name off the 
center, which opens to the public <DATE>Friday</DATE> as the <ORGANIZATION>San Diego Convention Center</ORGANIZATION>. A 
Stevens-led group has promised to protest and picket the opening ceremonies. 
</P>

<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Arizona House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> has approved
a state holiday honoring the slain civil rights leader <PERSON>Martin Luther
King Jr.</PERSON>, leaving legislators to focus their efforts on the state
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.
   The bill, which would designate the third <DATE>Monday</DATE> of each <DATE>January</DATE>
as ``Martin Luther King Civil Rights Day,'' passed the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> in a
35-24 vote <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   Democrat <PERSON>Carolyn Walker</PERSON>, the chief <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> sponsor, said there may
be as many as 17 votes for the bill, which needs 16 to pass.
   ``I have a, shall we say, gut feeling that this may be the
year,'' she said.
   Democratic Gov. <PERSON>Rose Mofford</PERSON>, who supports the King holiday,
issued a statement congratulating the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``I now appeal to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> for similar, non-divisive passage of
the King legislation so that I may sign it and together we can move
<LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> forward,'' she said.
   Former Republican Gov. <PERSON>Evan Mecham</PERSON>, who was impeached last <DATE>spring</DATE>
for attempting to thwart a death-threat investigation and misusing
funds, drew fire in <DATE>1987</DATE> for rescinding a holiday honoring King, a
move that prompted a boycott of the state by some organizations that
had planned to hold conventions in <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>.

   <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr.</ORGANIZATION> ``would be marching
hand-in-hand in the war against drugs'' if he were living,
Secretary of the Interior <PERSON>Manuel Lujan</PERSON> said <DATE>today</DATE> at an observance
of the slain civil rights leader's birthday.
   ``There are no opportunities for people addicted to drugs. There
is no dream,'' <PERSON>Lujan</PERSON> told an overflow crowd in the 850-seat
auditorium of the <ORGANIZATION>Interior Department</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``There is only the nightmare of the fatal consequences of drug
use,'' he said. ``<PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON> would not stand for drug use
and neither should we.''
   ``Part of our commitment to educating young Americans must
include programs to discourage them from the deadly scourge of
drugs,'' <PERSON>Lujan</PERSON> told the audience.
   ``If <PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON> were alive today, he would be marching
hand-in-hand in the war against drugs, fighting to stop the next
generation from destroying itself,'' he said.
   <PERSON>C.T. Vivian</PERSON>, a former member of <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s staff who now heads the
<ORGANIZATION>Black Action Strategies and Information Center</ORGANIZATION>, told the crowd in
which black people were in a slight preponderance, ``We would not
be meeting in this room right now if it were not for <ORGANIZATION>Martin King</ORGANIZATION>.''
   ``We knew the central prophet of our time,'' said <PERSON>Vivian</PERSON>. ``He
created the atmosphere in which we grew.''
   Later, a slightly smaller crowd gathered for a wreath-laying
ceremony outside the <LOCATION>Lincoln Memorial</LOCATION>, where King delivered his
celebrated ``I have a dream'' speech in the climax of a civil
rights march in <DATE>1963</DATE>.
   <PERSON>James M. Ridenour</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Park Service</ORGANIZATION>, told
the group, ``The sound of <PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON>'s words still rings in our ears.
As we stand here again in the place where he stood, we can feel his
presence.''
   King, leader of the black civil rights movement in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, was
shot to death <DATE>April 4, 1968</DATE>, in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>. <PERSON>James Earl Ray</PERSON> is serving
a life sentence for the slaying. King's birthday is being observed
<DATE>Monday</DATE> as a federal holiday. He was born <DATE>Jan. 15, 1929</DATE>.

CAN WE FINALLY HONOR DR. KING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the <DATE>60th birthday</DATE> of the Rev. <PERSON>Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON> draws near, the <LOCATION>San 
Diego City Council</LOCATION> has the opportunity to give the slain civil rights leader an 
early birthday present by voting <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to name the city's new convention 
center for him. 
</P>
<P>
If the <LOCATION>San Diego Unified Port District</LOCATION>, which is building the convention 
center, also approves the name, <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> will have gone a long way toward 
clearing the debris of the citizen initiative that stripped <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s name from a 
major downtown street. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the city's checkered history in trying to establish a public tribute to 
King, there will still be those who try to persuade the council and the port 
commissioners that the convention center is not the answer. 
</P>
<P>
The council and the commission should ignore those voices. 
</P>
<P>
Pleasing everyone is not the point. There is no building or street that would 
not generate criticism. 
</P>
<P>
What is important is that the country's seventh-largest city has no major 
public tribute to the man who probably did more for civil rights than anyone 
since <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Now is the time for <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>'s leaders to show some of the conviction of the 
man they are trying to honor. 
</P>
<P>
Already, too much time has passed; King was slain in <DATE>1968</DATE>. Already, the city 
has earned an embarrassing reputation for racism. Two attempts to name streets 
here for King have failed; first, when the council rejected a proposal to 
rename part of Euclid Avenue and 54th Street, and again when the voters 
reversed the council's decision to rename Market Street. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation to name the convention center for King was made by a 
council-appointed citizens committee that worked for almost a year, holding 
hearings throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
The council and the <ORGANIZATION>Port District</ORGANIZATION> should wholeheartedly endorse the committee's 
recommendation -- and not dilute it by using only <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s last name, as 
Councilman <PERSON>Wes Pratt</PERSON> suggested in an attempt to fend off opposition. 
</P>
<P>
We also urge the council to approve a <ORGANIZATION>Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION> proposal to establish 
a memorial to King in <LOCATION>Balboa Park</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the memorials would make a strong statement that the city recognizes 
<PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON>'s profound and courageous contribution to this and every 
community.

<HEAD>World to Celebrate King Day Amid Democracy Triumphs, Bomb Violence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pro-democracy demonstrations around the world and
fear gripping the Southeast after recent mail bombings are adding
meaning to this year's celebrations honoring <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>.
   Bells in 144 countries and the 50 <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> will ring out
simultaneously and Wall Street will pause for a moment of silence
<DATE>Monday</DATE> on what would have been the slain civil-rights leader's 61st
birthday.
   For the first time, <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s birthday will be celebrated on a
large scale in white-ruled <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. A weeklong celebration
will climax <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE>, when about 10,000 people are expected at a
<LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION> event honoring black leaders including Archbishop
Desmond Tutu and the Rev. <PERSON>Allan Boesak</PERSON>.
   In this country, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> have not
recognized the day as a state holiday. But organizers said bells
will ring in those states, and in the 47 states with King holidays,
at <TIME>12:30 p.m. EST</TIME>, when the <ORGANIZATION>Liberty Bell</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> is tapped.
   In <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s hometown of <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, the center of King Week
celebrations, the <DATE>1990</DATE> holiday comes amid death threats that
followed last month's mail bombings of civil rights and judicial
targets in three <LOCATION>Southeastern</LOCATION> states.
   ``With the Klan and the mail bombs, this year it has a more
special meaning for everybody,'' said state <PERSON>Sen. Arthur Langford</PERSON>,
who portrays King in a yearly production of <ORGANIZATION>Langford</ORGANIZATION>'s play ``Life
of a King.''
   ``People must understand that, in the words of <PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON>, we must
learn to live together as brothers and sisters or we will perish
together as fools.''
   King's widow, <PERSON>Coretta Scott King</PERSON>, said she will try to deflect
attention from the racial violence.
   ``To talk about this only invites people to do more of this kind
of violence,'' she said last week in announcing the week's events.
``It needs to be dealt with, but it needs to be dealt with in the
proper manner.''
   <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON> said she instead would emphasize pro-democracy
movements in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>.
   ``The same philosophy, strategy and tactics of non-violence that
we used to break down the walls of segregation are now being used
to tear down the <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> Wall and the Iron Curtain,'' she said.
   King Week <DATE>1990</DATE>, sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION>King Center for Nonviolent
Social Change</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>King Federal Holiday Commission</ORGANIZATION>, culminates
<DATE>Monday</DATE>, the first time the holiday has fallen on <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s actual
birthday.
   King led a non-violent movement for racial equality in the <DATE>1950s</DATE>
and <DATE>1960s</DATE> that led to passage of federal legislation ending
official discrimination and segregation. He was assassinated in
<LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1968</DATE>.
   In addition to the three states without King holidays, an
official <ORGANIZATION>King Day</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> is on hold. Wyoming's will be
celebrated for the first time, but only this year.
   In <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, Gov. <PERSON>Rose Mofford</PERSON> last fall signed into law a bill
to create a paid state holiday. But opponents filed petitions
calling for a referendum, keeping the law from becoming effective
until the vote. A King Day breakfast in <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, however, is
expected to draw 1,500.
   Wyoming's Democratic Gov. <PERSON>Mike Sullivan</PERSON> bucked the wishes of the
Republican-controlled Legislature and issued an executive order
calling for the holiday. However, the order only applies this year.
   Events scheduled in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> this year include the unveiling of a
sculpture at the King memorial center and a speech by the Rev.
<PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON>.
   A parade along <ORGANIZATION>Peachtree Street</ORGANIZATION> will conclude <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s events
and will be nationally televised for the first time.
   <PERSON>Stoney Johnson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>King Center</ORGANIZATION> media director, said security will
not be increased during any of the center's King Week activities
despite the mail bombs.
   ``It's so intense anyway that we don't need any more,'' he said.
   But <PERSON>Danny Levitan</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Center for
Democratic Renewal</ORGANIZATION>, which tracks hate group activity, warned that
violence may erupt in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> just after <DATE>King Day</DATE> and the rest of
the nation ``should expect some attempts to disrupt events or
commit acts of violence'' <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   On <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE>, <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> white supremacist <PERSON>Richard Barrett</PERSON> plans
a protest on <ORGANIZATION>National Park Service</ORGANIZATION> property across from <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s
crypt in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>. Park <ORGANIZATION>Service</ORGANIZATION> lawyers are reviewing the plan but
are expected to grant <PERSON>Barrett</PERSON> a permit, agency spokesman <PERSON>Paul
Winegar</PERSON> said.

   Communities planned celebrations and other events <DATE>Monday</DATE> to honor
slain civil rights leader <PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON>, including a
candlelight peace march in suburban <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> and an anti-apartheid
demonstration in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.
   King's birthday will be observed as a federal holiday <DATE>Monday</DATE> in
all but six states, including <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, where it will be business as
usual at state offices.
   In <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>, a mural painted by high school students
depicting non-violence was unveiled <DATE>Friday</DATE>, and Mayor <PERSON>Edward Koch</PERSON>
mayor spoke of the ``grace and glory'' King brought to the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, the celebrations ``help us keep <PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON>'s dream
alive and provide opportunities for all people to renew their
commitment to work for a society in which there is one standard of
equality and human rights,'' said state <PERSON>Sen. Jackie Vaughn</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>John Roy Castillo</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Michigan Civil Rights
Commission</ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s legacy has helped advance racial equality.
   ``Tremendous progress has been made over the <DATE>last 20</DATE> to 25
years,'' he said <DATE>Friday</DATE>. ``There are more minorities who are elected
officials, there are more minority businesses, more professionals.''
   But he noted the high poverty and school dropout rate among
minorities.
   A symposium was planned <DATE>Sunday</DATE> and <DATE>Monday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>University of
Michigan</ORGANIZATION> to honor <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s work. <PERSON>Willie L. Brown</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jr.</PERSON>, speaker of the
<LOCATION>California Assembly</LOCATION>, was to give the keynote address <DATE>Sunday</DATE> and
<LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>Andrew Young</PERSON>, a close associate of <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s, was
scheduled to speak <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   The end of King day will be marked by a candlelight peace march
at <ORGANIZATION>Roeper City and Country School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Bloomfield Hills</LOCATION>, a wealthy
northern suburb of <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, 26 teen-agers moved into the South
African consulate <DATE>Friday</DATE> for a weekend anti-apartheid protest to
mark <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s birthday.
   The students, none of them black and ranging in age from 13 to
19, occupied a hallway outside the consulate's third-floor office,
singing songs such as ``We Shall Overcome'' and other protest
anthems. The crowd blocked at least one person from entering.
   They said they would camp in the hallway until <DATE>Monday</DATE>, when
fellow protesters planned a march at the building to commemorate
<PERSON>King</PERSON>'s birthday and to denounce <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s system of racial
segregation.
   The mural unveiled <DATE>Friday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>Bronx Regional High School</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> was inspired after a student at the school was killed
in <DATE>1987</DATE>. Ten students painted, kept journals and did research about
non-violence for the 10-month project.
   ``This is a world they'd like to change and make more peaceful,''
said <PERSON>Mark Weiss</PERSON>, the school principal.
   The mural depicts Indian peace leader <PERSON>Mohandas Gandhi</PERSON>, <PERSON>King</PERSON>, a
sign saying ``end segregation in public schools'' and two hands
shaking, one black, one white.
   In <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, federal and city offices will be closed <DATE>Monday</DATE> but
all state offices will remain open.
   King's birthday was a state holiday in <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> for a brief time.
   Former Gov. <PERSON>Bruce Babbitt</PERSON>, a Democrat, created the holiday by
executive order in <DATE>1986</DATE> after the Legislature refused to act. But,
as one of his first official acts as governor, <PERSON>Evan Mecham</PERSON> rescinded
the order before the first holiday could be celebrated. The action
touched off the first major controversy of his short-lived
administration.
   <PERSON>Mecham</PERSON> said he acted because Attorney General <PERSON>Bob Corbin</PERSON>, a
fellow Republican, had said that <PERSON>Babbitt</PERSON>'s order was illegal because
a holiday requires legislative approval as well.
   Democratic Gov. <PERSON>Rose Mofford</PERSON>, who succeeded <PERSON>Mecham</PERSON> following his
impeachment and removal from office last year, is on record in favor
of a King holiday, although she has not followed <PERSON>Babbitt</PERSON> in creating
one by executive order.

VANDALS MARK HOLIDAY BY DEFACING SIGNS BEARING DR. KING'S NAME ON 94 FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the day honoring the Rev. <PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON>, vandals spray-painted a 
swastika and racial graffiti <DATE>Monday</DATE> on <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 94 freeway signs carrying the 
slain civil rights leader's name. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the signs have been defaced since they were unveiled 
two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Within two weeks after the 10-mile stretch of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 94 was christened in 
King's honor <DATE>Nov. 20</DATE>, the letters <ORGANIZATION>KKK</ORGANIZATION> were painted across one of the signs on 
the westbound side of the freeway near the <LOCATION>Lemon Grove</LOCATION> exit in <LOCATION>La Mesa</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
On <DATE>Monday</DATE>, two signs were painted with the letters <ORGANIZATION>SWP</ORGANIZATION>, which police believe 
stand for <ORGANIZATION>Supreme White Power</ORGANIZATION>, and with swastikas. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> police said one of the defaced signs was discovered at about <TIME>9 a.m.</TIME> 
on the east side of the freeway near <LOCATION>Interstate 805</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"We are treating this as a hate crime," Sgt. <PERSON>Fred England</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The second vandalized sign was on the west side of the highway, near the Spring 
Street exit in <LOCATION>La Mesa</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. <PERSON>George Walker Smith</PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION>Christ United Presbyterian Church</ORGANIZATION> 
and a black community leader, said he was not surprised by the defacing. "You 
can expect this from a racist community," he said. A memorial to <PERSON>King</PERSON> has been 
a sore point for <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>'s black community. 
</P>
<P>
Last <DATE>July</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Port Commissioners</ORGANIZATION>, in a 4-3 vote, rejected the <ORGANIZATION>City 
Council</ORGANIZATION>'s request to name the convention center after King. The <ORGANIZATION>San Diego 
Convention Center</ORGANIZATION> opened to the public four days after the unveiling of four 
new signs on <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 94. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. <PERSON>George Stevens</PERSON>, who led the convention center fight, denounced the 
latest incident. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate that this happened," he said. "But it's disgraceful that the 
elected leadership in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> has not taken a position on this. The 
leadership is perpetuating (racism) by not speaking out against it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The good people who are white should be embarrassed by this. . . . They should 
come out and condemn this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop <PERSON>George McKinney</PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION>St. Stephen's Church of God</ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION>Imperial 
Avenue</LOCATION>, was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Freeway Committee</ORGANIZATION>, which was 
formed to raise funds for the signs. He could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The naming of the freeway after <PERSON>King</PERSON> is the last of several official attempts 
to find a place to honor him. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>April, 1986</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> voted against naming <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 94 for King 
and voted instead to rename Market Street for him. But, in a referendum a year 
later, voters rejected <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Way</ORGANIZATION> and restored Market Street. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of that battle, members of the <ORGANIZATION>Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION> worked with 
black leaders to establish a scholarship fund and a statue of King in <LOCATION>Balboa 
Park</LOCATION>, which hasn't been erected. 
</P>
<P>
Last <DATE>September</DATE>, following the <ORGANIZATION>Port District</ORGANIZATION>'s decision on the convention 
center, the <ORGANIZATION>Legislature</ORGANIZATION> approved renaming <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 94 at the urging of 
Assemblyman <PERSON>Pete Chacon</PERSON> (D-San Diego) and state <PERSON>Sen. Wadie P. Deddeh</PERSON> (D-Chula 
Vista). But the <ORGANIZATION>Legislature</ORGANIZATION> stipulated that private donations be used to pay 
for the new signs.

   <PERSON>James Earl Ray</PERSON>, who pleaded guilty to
assassinating the Rev. <PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON>, says he was framed to
cover up an <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> plot to kill the civil rights leader and wants the

   Ray, 60, was sentenced to serve 99 years for <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s murder in
<LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, on <DATE>April 4, 1968</DATE>. The <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> parole board has
scheduled a <DATE>January</DATE> parole hearing for him, but <PERSON>Ray</PERSON> says he is not
hopeful.
   ``I doubt very much they'll give me a parole,'' he said. ``I
think the only way I'll get out of here is through a jury. If they
wouldn't grant me a trial I don't see how they'll grant me a
parole.''
   Ray pleaded guilty on the day his trial was to begin on <DATE>March 9,
1969</DATE>, but recanted three days later and has not received a complete
trial to prove his innocence.
   He alleges the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> threatened to jail his father and brother if
he didn't sign a confession. Ray's father was a fugitive from prison
and his brother spent several years in jail.
   In an interview at <ORGANIZATION>Brushy State Prison</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>East Tennessee</LOCATION> with
talk show host <PERSON>Morton Downey Jr.</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ray</PERSON> claimed he was set up in a
plot to kill King, whose calls for economic justice for minorities
and effective use of non-violent protest drew the wrath of then-FBI
Director <PERSON>J. Edgar Hoover</PERSON>.
   He said the government has refused his requests to review the
evidence against him, has never conducted ballistics tests on the
alleged murder weapon and has suppressed witnesses and
investigations that could have cleared him.
   ``Since they won't, they must be hiding something,'' <PERSON>Ray</PERSON> said of
the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION>. The show is scheduled to be aired <DATE>Nov. 28</DATE>.
   King was in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION> the day of his assassination to support a
strike by city sanitation workers seeking higher pay. Ray was
identified from fingerprints on a rifle found near the <PERSON>Lorraine
Motel</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION> where King was killed as he stood on a balcony.
   <PERSON>Hosea Williams</PERSON>, an aide to King present when he was shot, said
during taping <DATE>Monday</DATE> of ``The <PERSON>Morton Downey Jr</PERSON>. Show '' that ``I've
never believed Ray killed <PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON>.''
   <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> said <PERSON>King</PERSON> was convinced that <PERSON>Hoover</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> was plotting
his death. He also said he was surprised to find days after the
assassination that ``Ray had no political philosophy. He was just a
two-bit redneck hustler.''
   Many blacks have expressed anger that the <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> board has
scheduled a <DATE>January</DATE> parole hearing for Ray. Under a <DATE>1985</DATE> law
providing parole hearings for inmates held for 20 years, <PERSON>Ray</PERSON> became
eligible for parole consideration this month.
   The law was designed to allow the state to relieve prison
overcrowding.
   <PERSON>James M. Brown</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Tennessee Voters Council</ORGANIZATION> and a
member of the <ORGANIZATION>Dr. Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>State Holiday Committee</ORGANIZATION>,
called <PERSON>Ray</PERSON>'s parole hearing ``cruel, dangerous and shameful,'' and
said he would ask Gov. <PERSON>Ned McWherter</PERSON> to call it off. He noted the
hearing in <DATE>January</DATE> would coincide with the <DATE>Jan. 16 holiday</DATE> honoring
<PERSON>King</PERSON>'s birthday.
   But <PERSON>McWherter</PERSON> told reporters <DATE>Monday</DATE> that he will not interfere
with the decision of the board, which by law is an independent state
agency.
