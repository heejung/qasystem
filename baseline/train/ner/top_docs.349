   Despite the recession, Santa Claus's bag will be heavy
this year.
   While retailers in general report little holiday cheer,
many booksellers are ringing up sales that are comfortably
ahead of last year's. Pricey coffee-table books have suffered
in the recession and book buyers are choosy, but they aren't
leaving stores empty-handed.

<TEXT>
   "The combination of my instinct and the pattern so far
tells me Christmas is going to be very good for books," says
<PERSON>Edward Morrow</PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION>Northshire Bookstore</ORGANIZATION> in
<ORGANIZATION>Manchester Center</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Vt.</LOCATION>, and former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>American
Booksellers Association</ORGANIZATION>. "Sales of nonbook items like records
and toys are down in my store, but books are up. It tells me
that people look upon books as items of substance worth
having in times of stress."
   Besides the search by financially stressed consumers for
reasonably priced gifts, booksellers cite an unusually broad
selection of high-quality and popular titles in many
categories. "We're a product-driven business, and the product
is wonderful right now," says <PERSON>Jeff Rogart</PERSON>, vice president of
merchandising for <ORGANIZATION>Waldenbooks</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Kmart Corp.</ORGANIZATION> "I've
been in this business 20 years, and this is the best season
for books I can remember. Almost every major novelist has a
book out; then you throw in `<PERSON>Scarlett</PERSON>' and <PERSON>Katharine
Hepburn</PERSON>'s memoirs, and there is even a new <PERSON>Betty Crocker</PERSON>
cookbook."
   Booksellers say there isn't a single "must-have" title
this year, like the <MONEY>$50</MONEY> "Civil War" book that sold more than
half a million copies last year. While "Scarlett" continues
to rack up impressive sales, a wide range of novels by
popular favorites like <PERSON>Tom Clancy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Stephen King</PERSON> are
selling briskly, as are practical, basic nonfiction books
like cookbooks and home-improvement guides. "The Best
Treatment," a home reference guide on treatments for various
ailments, is a major how-to hit since <PERSON>Ann Landers</PERSON> plugged it
in a column recently.
   Price is clearly a factor in consumers' book shopping.
"There isn't a lot of impulse buying," says <PERSON>Brian Weese</PERSON>,
general manager of Encore Books, a chain of 83 stores in the
mid-Atlantic region. "There isn't one book selling in what I
call floor-stack quantities, where we stack it on the floor
in waist-high piles and the stacks just melt."
   "We definitely feel the effects of the recession in the
high-ticket coffee-table books," says <PERSON>Robert Teicher</PERSON>, a book
buyer for <ORGANIZATION>Book Inventory Systems Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which supplies books
for several dozen extra-large, upscale bookstores. A photo
collection by <PERSON>Annie Leibovitz</PERSON>, at <MONEY>$60</MONEY>, is a top seller in its
category, he adds, though not doing as well as expected. And
in areas like cookbooks, old standbys are selling faster than
newer models: the revised 40th anniversary edition of <PERSON>Betty
Crocker</PERSON>'s cookbook "is a classic and also a great buy at
<MONEY>$22</MONEY>," <PERSON>Mr. Teicher</PERSON> says.
   <PERSON>Shanna Hamilton</PERSON>, manager of a <PERSON>B. Dalton</PERSON> bookstore in
<LOCATION>Dearborn</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, says, "People will ask for something cheaper
in the same category, or they'll buy something off the
bargain table. A lot of people balk at paying <MONEY>$25</MONEY> for a
hardcover novel, so even for gifts they'll ask `What do you
have by that author in paperback?'"
   Catering to consumers' interest in bargain basics, <PERSON>B.
Dalton</PERSON> is running a tie-in program called "Master Value,"
which gives a <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> discount on 20 popular titles to anybody
charging at least <MONEY>$55</MONEY> on their <ORGANIZATION>MasterCard</ORGANIZATION>. This has given an
extra boost to such favorites as "The Joy of Cooking" and
<PERSON>Shel Silverstein</PERSON>'s "A Light in the Attic." Also courtesy of
the special deal, "Civil War" has shot back to No. 1 on <PERSON>B.
Dalton</PERSON>'s list of best-selling coffee-table books.
   The sticker shock caused by full-size hardcover books is
one of the factors boosting sales of small, cleverly packaged
gift books ranging from the silly to the inspirational. One
of the sleeper hits of <DATE>last Christmas</DATE> was a palm-sized <MONEY>$8.95</MONEY>
paperback called "Meditations for Women Who Do Too Much."
This year there are dozens of tempting little tomes under
<MONEY>$10</MONEY>, but nothing has sold like "French For Cats," a tiny
hardcover featuring a cartoon cat wearing a beret.
   So far, more than 170,000 copies of the book are in print,
and it's selling big at both chain stores and independent
bookstores. At the classy <ORGANIZATION>Brentano</ORGANIZATION>'s chain, "French For Cats"
is outselling "Scarlett." <ORGANIZATION>Henry Beard</ORGANIZATION>, the book's author, did
well previously with "Miss <ORGANIZATION>Piggy</ORGANIZATION>'s Guide to Life" and "Latin
for All Occasions," but the cat book is his biggest hit to
date.
   This silly book purports to portray a cat's thoughts, with
English expressions like "I think I'm going to cough up a fur
ball" translated into French. It has captivated book buyers,
and its publisher, <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Villard Books</ORGANIZATION> division,
says it was all by design.
   "We knew people were resisting high book prices, and we
noticed that small books were selling, selling, selling,"
says <PERSON>Diane Reverand</PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION>Villard</ORGANIZATION>. "I think the cute
packaging is a big selling point, and it's a level of whimsy
people need at the moment, with things so bleak. You can't
even say the title aloud without smiling." At this rate, a
sequel seems likely. Perhaps "Italian for Dogs," says <PERSON>Ms.
Reverand</PERSON>.
   Children's books, meanwhile, continue to boom, almost
regardless of price. At <ORGANIZATION>Books &amp; Books</ORGANIZATION>, a bookstore in <LOCATION>Coral
Gables</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, the most popular children's book is "Pish Posh
Said <PERSON>Hieronymus Bosch</PERSON>," an illustrated book selling for
<MONEY>$18.95</MONEY>. The favorite children's book nationwide seems to be
"The Jolly Christmas Postman," a <MONEY>$16.95</MONEY> picturebook with
letters and postcards that can be removed and read. It's the
sequel to "The Jolly Postman," also by <PERSON>Janet</PERSON> and <PERSON>Allan
Ahlberg</PERSON>.
   Books in every price range tied to <ORGANIZATION>Walt Disney</ORGANIZATION>'s new movie
"Beauty and the <LOCATION>Beast</LOCATION>" are also big sellers. And sales have
been strong for many titles by the recently deceased <PERSON>Dr.
Seuss</PERSON>. Publisher <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> combined six <PERSON>Seuss</PERSON> favorites in
a <MONEY>$25</MONEY> hardcover book that is a big gift item.
   Even in tough times, there are still enough big spenders
out there to make a success of <ORGANIZATION>Alfred A. Knopf</ORGANIZATION>'s two-volume
set on "The Sistine Chapel," priced at <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY>. Produced with
<ORGANIZATION>Nippon Television Network Association</ORGANIZATION>, which funded the
chapel's restoration, the set's lavish 740 pages feature 600
color photographs.
   "We published a limited edition of 2,500, and only 500 are
still in the warehouse; I expect those to be gone by
Christmas," says <PERSON>Bruce Harris</PERSON>, an executive vice president of
<ORGANIZATION>Knopf parent Random House Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "About <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> have sold to
institutions like libraries and museums, but the rest are
being bought by individuals. Many bookstores have said to us,
`I'll take two or three, and I know exactly who I'm going to
sell them to.'"

<LEADPARA>  ASK James Mason why the anthology "When I Am an Old Woman I Shall Wear Purple"
has sold 200,000 copies, an astounding number for a book from a small
publisher, and he'll tell you it's certainly not because Watsonville-based
Papier-Mache Press has a large advertising budget.;    "Firstly, it taps a
very much neglected and increasingly vast senior citizen market," says Mason,
marketing manager for Papier-Mache Press, which three years ago published the
anthology of stories, poems and photographs about growing old. "And the
combination of simple, evocative language and photographs has given the book
an astonishing word-of-mouth promotion."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Professional word-of-mouth promotion, when booksellers recommend their
favorites to customers, is known in the industry as "hand selling," and over
time it often can turn a little-known book such as "When I Am an Old Woman I
Shall Wear Purple" into something of a best seller.;    It's that kind of
word-of-mouth promotion the <ORGANIZATION>American Booksellers Association</ORGANIZATION> wants to
encourage with its first-ever ABBY award, announced early this month. The
<MONEY>$5,000</MONEY> award, voted on by ABA-member bookstores, will be presented at the
association's <DATE>June</DATE> meeting in <LOCATION>New York.</LOCATION>;    "When I Am An Old Woman I Shall
Wear Purple" was named one of three runners-up in the competition. Another
steady seller that seemed unlikely to make the leap to best seller, "The
Education of Little Tree," got top honors as the American Booksellers Book of
the Year.;    "The Education of Little Tree" is Forrest <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>'s
autobiographical account of his <DATE>1930s</DATE> boyhood spent with his Cherokee
grandparents in the <LOCATION>Appalachian Mountains</LOCATION> of Tennessee.;    <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>, who died
in <DATE>1979</DATE> at the age of 53, also wrote the novel "Gone to <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>," which was made
into the <PERSON>Clint Eastwood</PERSON> film "The Outlaw Josey Wales." Still, his name was
hardly a household word on a par with <PERSON>Sidney Sheldon</PERSON> or <PERSON>Louis L'Amour</PERSON> when
"The Education of Little Tree" was published by Delacorte in <DATE>1976.</DATE>;    The
book was warmly if not widely reviewed. The <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> noted that, "Some of it
is sad, some of it is hilarious, some of it is unbelievable and all of it is
charming.";    A paperback edition was published by <ORGANIZATION>Dell/Laurel Leaf</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE>.
Word spread and, over the years, "The Education of Little Tree" became a cult
classic, even though the book went out of print.;    Five years ago, though,
the <ORGANIZATION>University of New Mexico Press</ORGANIZATION> brought out a <MONEY>$10.95</MONEY> trade paperback
edition that has sold almost a quarter of a million copies. It has been the
press's best-selling book for two straight years and sales show no sign of
abating; more than 25,000 copies were shipped out in <DATE>January</DATE> and February.;   
Similarly, Papier-Mache Press plans to publish a hardcover edition of "When I
Am an Old Woman I Shall Wear Purple" in <DATE>July</DATE>. The hardcover book, which will
sell for <MONEY>$16</MONEY>, will be issued simultaneously with an updated paperback version
priced at <MONEY>$10.</MONEY>;    Other runners-up for the ABBY award were the best-selling
"The Civil War," by <PERSON>Geoffrey Ward</PERSON> with <PERSON>Ric Burns</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ken Burns</PERSON>, the companion
volume to the popular PBS series; "The Shell Seekers," a novel by <PERSON>Rosamunde
Pilcher</PERSON> that also made best-seller lists; and "Cold Sassy Tree," the late
Olive <PERSON>Ann Burns</PERSON>' novel about family relationships in a small <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> town.;   
The awards process began in <DATE>January</DATE>, when booksellers nominated the five books
they most enjoyed hand selling in <DATE>1990</DATE>. Any book in print, fiction or
non-fiction, was eligible. In <DATE>February</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>ABA</ORGANIZATION> announced the 10 ABBY
finalists as culled from the 2,000 nominations made by more than 400
booksellers. Final voting took place in <LOCATION>March.</LOCATION>;    In the weekly <ORGANIZATION>ABA</ORGANIZATION>
newsletter, executive director <PERSON>Bernie Rath</PERSON> noted that one of the intentions of
the ABBY award program was to generate a list for bookstores of titles that
sell steadily over time, the so-called midlist books.;    The other five
finalists for the ABBY were <PERSON>Barbara Kingsolver</PERSON>'s novels "Animal Dreams" and
"The Bean Trees"; <ORGANIZATION>Fannie Flagg</ORGANIZATION>'s funny novel "Fried Green Tomatoes at the
Whistle Stop Cafe"; <PERSON>Kazuo Ishiguro</PERSON>'s critically acclaimed novel "The Remains
of the Day"; and <PERSON>Jill K. Conway</PERSON>'s memoir of her Australian girlhood, "Road
from Coorain."  </TEXT>

   Doubleday Pulls Out All the Stops
   For Reissue of Stephen King Novel

   NEW YORK -- In 1978, "The Stand" was Stephen King's first
best seller, selling fewer than 100,000 copies in hardcover.
A new, longer version of the novel is now for sale at nearly
double the price, and publisher Doubleday has printed one
million copies.
   The original "Stand" hit the New York Times best seller
list at 15th place and climbed no farther than No. 13: The
new version of the novel will start on the New York Times
list Sunday, in first place. A signed, limited edition of
1,250 copies in black leather stamped with gold is sold out
at $325 each; book collectors have offered the publisher as
much as $1,200 for a copy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Reflected in this episode are the vast changes in the
market for hardcover books over the past decade, but the
principal factor is the singular phenomenon of <PERSON>Mr. King</PERSON>'s
popularity. Also, <ORGANIZATION>Doubleday</ORGANIZATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION>Bertelsmann AG</ORGANIZATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, has
pulled out all promotional stops to incite the fans.
   In addition to the deluxe edition, Doubleday got
bookstores across the country to take "reservations" for the
book (which sometimes resulted in a discount) and set up a
special "Stand Hotline" with the details of what's included
in the book. About 200 people a day still call the hotline,
though the book has arrived at most stores in recent weeks.
   When <PERSON>Mr. King</PERSON> approached Doubleday in the mid-80s about
re-issuing the novel, the publisher was skeptical, despite
<PERSON>Mr. King</PERSON>'s record for the most best sellers of the past
decade. Doubleday had originally cut about 400 pages from the
book because production costs would have mandated a hardcover
price of <MONEY>$12.95</MONEY>, which seemed too high in <DATE>1978</DATE> for a
non-best-selling author. "You had an already monstrous book
(823 pages)," says <PERSON>Peter Schneider</PERSON>, <PERSON>Doubleday</PERSON>'s director of
marketing. "It's a tremendous story, but would people buy it
again?"
   Bookstore managers say they'll be surprised if Doubleday
can move one million copies of "The Stand: The Complete and
Uncut Edition" in hardcover. But they do expect it to sell
many times better than the original version, which is
extremely rare. In the odd instance when an updated version
of a book is issued, it generally sells far fewer copies, as
when <PERSON>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</PERSON>'s book "<DATE>August 1914</DATE>" was
re-issued 17 years later with <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> new material. (Exact sales
figures aren't available.)
   "So far, it isn't doing quite as well as a new <PERSON>Stephen
King</PERSON>, but it's awfully close," says <PERSON>Tom Simon</PERSON>, vice president
of merchandising for the Waldenbooks subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>K mart
Corp.</ORGANIZATION> "The big question is the staying power: Is this just a
flurry, or will it stay No. 1 for several months, like most
of his books?"
   One reason for <ORGANIZATION>Doubleday</ORGANIZATION>'s optimistic print run is the
basic change in the hardcover market: While only the hottest
best sellers sold above 75,000 copies in the '70s, best
sellers now routinely sell above 300,000 in hardcover. The
rapid growth in the bookstore chains, along with the more
recent growth in warehouse stores and discount clubs, has
spread books into hundreds of new outlets, most of which
offer substantial discounts to the cover price. The
perception of hardcover books as a splurge has moderated:
Retail price for "The Stand" is <MONEY>$24.95</MONEY>, high even for a major
author, but buyers can find it discounted up to <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT>.
   Booksellers say that if this ploy works, <PERSON>Mr. King</PERSON> deserves
the credit. "<PERSON>Danielle Steel</PERSON>, for one, has a huge following,
but I don't think you could re-release one of her back
titles," says <PERSON>Gary DelVecchio</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Doubleday Book
Shops</ORGANIZATION> (no relation to the book's publisher). "<PERSON>Stephen King</PERSON> is
in a class by himself. He's got almost a cult following."
   Not only are his first editions the most prized of
contemporary authors' to collectors, but <PERSON>Mr. King</PERSON> himself is
the subject of more books than he's written, says <PERSON>George
Beahm</PERSON>, author of "The Stephen King Companion." And "The
Stand," with a complicated, fantasy plot about good and evil
and the end of the world, is considered his best book by
fans. "It's ironic," says <PERSON>Mr. Beahm</PERSON>, "that what was once
considered this book's weak point, its length, is now touted
as its strong point."

   Reporter's Notebook --
   Booksellers Pass the Word at Convention:
   The Trend Is Big Stores, Broad Selection

   LAS VEGAS, Nev. -- For book lovers -- those who prefer
bookstores that sell more books than video games and party
favors -- there is good news from the American Booksellers
Association's annual convention.
   Bookstore owners attending the convention, which runs
through tomorrow, say the overriding trend in bookstores
today is bigger stores that carry a broad selection of
titles, including previous titles by authors and books by
emerging writers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The trend is breadth: The public is interested in
everything," says <PERSON>Edward A. Morrow Jr.</PERSON>, president of the
<ORGANIZATION>American Booksellers</ORGANIZATION> and owner of the <ORGANIZATION>Northshire Bookstore</ORGANIZATION> in
<ORGANIZATION>Manchester Center</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Vt</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Morrow</PERSON> says that the vast
expansion in bookstores in the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, coupled with the
demographic growth of book-buying, well-educated yuppies, has
led to an increase in book sales in many areas, from computer
and self-help books to literary fiction.
   <PERSON>Mr. Morrow</PERSON> says that he added non-book items to his own
stock in years past "for defensive reasons, because margins
were better. But now, it's so important to have depth to be
competitive that we're looking to cut back in stationery and
maybe games, so we'll have more room for books."
   Not only are independent bookstore owners re-emphasizing a
broad, thoughtful selection of books, but the big bookstore
chains are also adding titles. The two biggest chains, <PERSON>B.
Dalton</PERSON>, a unit of closely held <ORGANIZATION>BDB Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, and the <LOCATION>Waldenbooks</LOCATION>
unit of <ORGANIZATION>K mart Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, are adding titles in their mall stores
and expanding smaller chains, such as <ORGANIZATION>Brentano</ORGANIZATION>'s, which is
owned by Waldenbooks, that have more books, a classy image
and lots of service.
   The most extreme shift is that of <ORGANIZATION>Crown Books Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a
discount chain based in <LOCATION>Landover</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, which has grown to 260
stores by selling a limited selection of mostly best sellers
for discounts as high as <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT>.
   Crown is just starting to build a series of Super Crown
stores, which have three times as many titles as the old
stores, or about 30,000, says President <PERSON>Robert Haft</PERSON>. Two
Super Crown stores that opened within the past three weeks
near <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> offer discounts even on specially ordered
books. The ambiance of the stores, with piped in classical
music and benches that encourage browsing, isn't what Crown
is known for.
   <PERSON>Mr. Haft</PERSON>, who says people tend to spend about one-third
more money at the new, bigger stores, says: "We just listened
to our customers. They said they loved our prices but there
were more books they wanted to read. I think it's a trend
reflected in all kinds of retailing. People don't just want
low prices, but also service and selection." <PERSON>Mr. Haft</PERSON> says he
has signed leases for four more Super Crown bookstores, and
if they do well, more will follow.
   Among the hundreds of exhibitors' booths here, there are
plenty of non-book products vying for booksellers'
attentions. There are half a dozen booths offering fancy
bookmarks alone, plus others selling videotapes, games,
stuffed animals, rubber stamps, post cards and
answering-machine audiotapes featuring impersonations of
movie stars. There is even a patented invention by housewife
<PERSON>Patty Sremba</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Anaheim Hills</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, called a Sunbuddy, a
little paper device retailing for <MONEY>$1.99</MONEY> that pops up to shade
a paperback book from the sun.
   Even while the staffs of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> publishing houses moan
about the tackiness of <LOCATION>Vegas</LOCATION>, there seems to be a consensus
among the bookish crowd that this <ORGANIZATION>ABA</ORGANIZATION> convention has been
more respectful about books than some in years past. "It
seems like there was more frivolity at earlier conventions;
lots of fitness celebrities and people dressed as cartoon
characters," says novelist <PERSON>Mark Childress</PERSON>. "This year, it
seems like everybody is running around trying to get galleys
{uncorrected, pre-publication copies of books} before they
run out. The focus is on the books."
   ---
   Proof of the mass popularity of bookstores comes from a
new national poll, released by the <ORGANIZATION>ABA</ORGANIZATION> at the convention.
   <PERSON>Bernard Rath</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Booksellers
Association</ORGANIZATION>, says that 93 million Americans visit a bookstore
at least once a month, according to a national telephone
survey conducted by <ORGANIZATION>Wirthlin Group</ORGANIZATION>. Of those who visit a
bookstore at least once a month, says <PERSON>Mr. Rath</PERSON>, about <PERCENT>54%</PERCENT> are
women; and <PERCENT>62%</PERCENT> of the visitors are between the ages of 18 and
44. <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> region stand out for their
share of bookstore traffic.
   Since the <ORGANIZATION>ABA</ORGANIZATION> hasn't conducted such a survey before, it
isn't clear whether people are visiting bookstores more or
less often than in the past, but bookstore sales have been
climbing rapidly, says <PERSON>Mr. Rath</PERSON>. A recent <ORGANIZATION>ABA/Commerce
Department</ORGANIZATION> report showed an increase in retail bookstore
sales to <MONEY>$5.1 billion</MONEY> in <DATE>1987</DATE>, from <MONEY>$3.1 billion</MONEY> in <DATE>1982</DATE>.
Sales are expected to reach <MONEY>$7.2 billion</MONEY> in <DATE>1990</DATE>. st
   ---
   Amid the optimism, <PERSON>Mr. Rath</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>ABA</ORGANIZATION> executive director,
sees several discouraging trends. The survey on bookstore
visits showed that only half the 93 million Americans that
enter a bookstore monthly actually buy a book. <PERSON>Mr. Rath</PERSON>
believes that publishers and booksellers have to band
together to aggressively promote reading.
   One possible tool for promoting books and reading is a new
weekly television series, "First Edition," conceived by a
group of public television producers. At a meeting in the
convention center <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr. Rath</PERSON> presented the idea to a
small group of influential bookstore owners, hoping to get
them to help commit some funding that could then be added to
anticipated corporate and foundation support.
   The new show would be produced by <ORGANIZATION>KQED</ORGANIZATION>, a public
television station in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. The producers emphasize
that this wouldn't be another talking-heads show with
professorial writers blathering on. <PERSON>Marjorie Poore</PERSON>, vice
president for national production at <ORGANIZATION>KQED</ORGANIZATION>, says the show is
modeled more on the syndicated "Entertainment Tonight" than
news shows on public television. It would feature visits to
authors at their homes; reports on industry trends, gossip
and best sellers and reviews, says <PERSON>Ms. Poore</PERSON>.
   Booksellers and publishing executives in the room wondered
if publishers would have enough money in their promotional
budgets for such a venture. Even if funding is found, <PERSON>Ms.
Poore</PERSON> says, "First Edition" probably won't get on the air
before <DATE>fall of 1991</DATE>.
   ---
   There is little doubt among convention-goers about what
will be THE big book this fall: "The Plains of Passage" by
<PERSON>Jean Auel</PERSON>.
   It certainly isn't because <PERSON>Ms. Auel</PERSON>'s publisher, the <ORGANIZATION>Crown
Publishing</ORGANIZATION> unit of <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION>, threw a party for 1,000
people on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, complete with wild-animal sounds
and a ballroom-sized copy of the book's cover. (Actually, it
wasn't the cover but a movie backdrop from the film "The Old
Gringo.") This is <PERSON>Ms. Auel</PERSON>'s fourth book in a series about a
couple living in the Ice Age that started with "Clan of the
Cave Bear" in <DATE>1979</DATE>. Her last offering, "The Mammoth Hunters"
came out five years ago, and her fans have been eagerly
awaiting the next book.
   <PERSON>Tom Simon</PERSON>, a Waldenbooks vice president, says "People have
been asking for this book for years. Thousands of people have
called Waldenbooks to reserve a copy of this, and it won't be
out for months."
   In general, booksellers take for granted that new novels
by all the big guns, such as <PERSON>John Updike</PERSON> ("Rabbit at Rest" is
out this <DATE>fall</DATE> from Knopf) and <PERSON>Jackie Collins</PERSON> will
automatically be published in huge quantities, heavily
advertised and sought out by fans. Thus, they are pretty sure
to be best sellers. Betting gets much trickier when it comes
to books, however promising, by little-known authors.
   But one author who may make the leap to bestsellerdom this
year is <PERSON>Mr. Childress</PERSON>, whose third novel, "Tender," is
getting special treatment from Harmony, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Random
House</ORGANIZATION>'s Crown Publishing. <PERSON>Bruce Harris</PERSON>, an executive vice
president of <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION>, says the novel, about an Elvis
Presley-like rock star, "just got everybody excited at <LOCATION>Crown</LOCATION>
when they read it." When a copy was sent to <PERSON>Stephen King</PERSON>, the
bestselling author contributed a blurb calling the book "the
best rock 'n' roll novel I ever read."
   <PERSON>Mr. Harris</PERSON> decided to promote the book heavily, including
a 15-city author tour this <DATE>fall</DATE>, plus a party at the <ORGANIZATION>ABA</ORGANIZATION>
convention. Trying to create a buzz about the book among
booksellers, "Tender" is the only book he's handing out in
galleys this year. <PERSON>Mr. Harris</PERSON> recalls that a decade ago, he
handed out galleys at the <ORGANIZATION>ABA</ORGANIZATION> convention of "Clan of the Cave
Bear;" he hopes "Tender" will be a "surprise" best seller,
too.

   NEW YORK -- The mood of many booksellers on the eve of
their annual convention is apprehensive, but the news for
consumers is mostly good.
   Despite disappointing Christmas sales and a slow spring,
booksellers are hopeful about the fall, when an unusually
dense crop of books by best-selling authors will be
published. Tom Clancy and Stephen King will both have new
books out, and booksellers have high hopes for Katharine
Hepburn's autobiography and the long-awaited sequel to "Gone
With the Wind." These and hundreds of other new fall titles
will be trumpeted by publishers as the annual convention of
the American Booksellers Association starts tomorrow.

<TEXT>
   Many booksellers complain about erratic sales, but the
<ORGANIZATION>ABA</ORGANIZATION>'s executive director, <PERSON>Bernard Rath</PERSON>, says that bookstores
are doing better than most other retailers. Book sales in the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> rose to <MONEY>$7.3 billion</MONEY> in <DATE>1990</DATE>, an increase of <PERCENT>12.3%</PERCENT> from
the year before. <PERSON>Mr. Rath</PERSON> says book sales should rise about
<PERCENT>8.2%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1991</DATE>.
   But booksellers argue that the sales rise can be
attributed partly to price increases. Furthermore, with the
rapid growth in bookstores in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, those sales are
spread more thinly. To keep their profits from diving, both
large chains and onestore owners are working harder to
attract and please consumers with everything from extra
discounts and service to a wider selection. Similarly,
hard-pressed publishers have begun cutting their lists and
paying more attention to marketing.
   "We keep looking for the light at the end of the tunnel,
but it just doesn't get any brighter," says <PERSON>William Rickman</PERSON>,
president of the <ORGANIZATION>Kroch's &amp; Brentano</ORGANIZATION>'s chain in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. "Our
store on glamorous <LOCATION>Michigan Avenue</LOCATION> still does fine, but the
mall stores are really struggling."
   To pursue buyers more aggressively, <PERSON>Mr. Rickman</PERSON> is
offering more in-store author readings. He is also actively
pursuing organizations around town that have scheduled
speeches by authors, promising to deliver tablefuls of books
beforehand.
   At <LOCATION>Bookland</LOCATION>, a chain of 15 bookstores in <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, store
managers are attending "salesmanship school" with a
consultant. "We want every customer to be greeted as they
enter the store," says <PERSON>Nan Knecht</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Bookland</ORGANIZATION>'s district
manager, "and they're training us to do more add-on sales:
You might say to a customer, `You like <PERSON>Stephen King</PERSON>? Have you
ever tried Dean <PERSON>Koontz</PERSON>?' They taught us that the first book
you sell to a person goes to overhead, and the second will
boost profits."
   The famous book lover's paradise in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>, the Tattered
Cover bookstore, is holding seminars for local elementary
school teachers to introduce them to new children's books.
"Bookstores have always been a community resource, but I
think we are all looking to do that to an even greater
degree," says <PERSON>Joyce Meskis</PERSON>, the store's owner and the
president of the booksellers' group.
   Some stores are thriving -- especially those that offer
service and ambiance along with discount prices. Book
<ORGANIZATION>Inventory Systems Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which runs about 13 elegant, lavishly
stocked Borders Book Shops around the country plus another 10
big stores for clients, says it has had "double-digit
increases" this year in existing stores. <PERSON>Robert Di Romualdo</PERSON>,
president of the company, says some of the gains may result
from a highly sophisticated computer-ordering system, but
espresso bars and <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT> discounts on best sellers help.
   Even big chains like Waldenbooks are working harder to
please. The chain's Preferred Reader program attracted four
million members in the first year. People pay <MONEY>$10</MONEY> to join,
then receive an extra <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> discount at Waldenbooks stores,
plus a <MONEY>$5</MONEY> gift certificate for every <MONEY>$100</MONEY> they spend.
Waldenbooks is also reducing non-book merchandise throughout
the chain and broadening the titles it carries.
   Many publishers are in a grim mood, too, under pressure by
their owners to keep profits up despite the recession. Books
are coming out now for which hefty advances were paid a year
or two ago, and modest sales wouldn't cover costs. Revered
literary publisher <ORGANIZATION>North Point Press</ORGANIZATION> closed its doors this
year, and others may follow, the doom sayers predict.
   But some of the consequences are positive for consumers.
Meeting resistance to prices above <MONEY>$20</MONEY> for hardcover books,
some publishers are pricing selected titles aggressively low.
Bantam's best-selling hardcover at the moment is "Heir to the
Empire," a novel based on the "Star Wars" movies. The <MONEY>$15</MONEY>
cover price has definitely helped fuel sales, says a
spokesman. A Bantam medical thriller, "Extreme Measures," at
<MONEY>$14.95</MONEY>, sports a banner across the jacket declaring "Special
Low Price]" <ORGANIZATION>HarperCollins Publishers</ORGANIZATION> is selling its novel
"Vengeance" for <MONEY>$14.95</MONEY> until <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Signet</ORGANIZATION> division of <ORGANIZATION>Penguin USA</ORGANIZATION> is offering a
money-back guarantee on a paperback thriller called "Sea
Lion." The guarantee is touted on the back cover and inside
the book -- a spokesman says nobody has asked for money back
yet -- along with a sweepstakes.
   One positive development is the movement among publishers
to publish more creatively. "Things are as bad as everybody
says, but the good news is fewer books are being published
and publishers think harder about how they publish them,"
says literary agent <PERSON>Andrew Wylie</PERSON>.
   Two examples of novels by unknown authors that became
best-sellers because of clever jackets, advance reading
copies for store buyers and follow-up advertising: "The
Firm," a thriller from <PERSON>Doubleday</PERSON>, and "How to Make an
American Quilt," a first novel published by <ORGANIZATION>Villard</ORGANIZATION>. "Other
publishers keep saying to me that this is the kind of book
that gives them hope," says <PERSON>Stephen Rubin</PERSON>, president of
<ORGANIZATION>Doubleday</ORGANIZATION>, about "The Firm." "We didn't overpay to start, and
then we nurtured it."

<HL> Waldenbooks to Cut Some Book Prices In Stages in Test of New Selling Tactic </HL>
<AUTHOR> Cynthia Crossen (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<CO> KM </CO>
<IN> RET PUB </IN>
<TEXT>
   In a departure from traditional book retailing practices, <LOCATION>Waldenbooks</LOCATION>, the country's largest bookseller, said it will gradually cut the prices on some books until the books are sold. 

   Unlike most retailers, booksellers enjoy the luxury of being able to return unsold merchandise for full credit. 
If a book isn't selling, there is no incentive for retailers to cut the price and accept a lower profit margin. 

   But some book sellers now believe the key to increasing retail sales is to encourage impulse buying. 
While best-sellers will bring customers into the bookstores, discounts may increase the number of books each customer buys. 

   In a six-month to 12-month test of that, <LOCATION>Waldenbooks</LOCATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>K mart Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, is initiating a program in which its retail stores will be able to order titles from a Waldenbooks catalog of some 100 to 125 "bargain books." 
The books, which may not be returned to the publishers, include some former bestsellers, like "Mammoth Hunters" by <PERSON>Jean Auel</PERSON>, "Eat to Succeed" by <PERSON>Robert Haas</PERSON> and "McMahon!" by <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Bears</ORGANIZATION> quarterback <PERSON>Jim McMahon</PERSON>; some children's books, like "The Wind in the Willows" and "Peter Rabbit"; and some art books. 
Walden has agreed with its vendors to pay less for the books since they aren't returnable. 

   The books will be discounted in three steps. 
When a book has been in the store for 60 days, the price will be reduced. 
After another 30 days, the price will be reduced again. 
Depending on the original price of the book, there will be a third reduction 120 days after the book entered the store. 
As prices are reduced, the books will be moved from one area of the store to another. 

   "The chains have done many different kinds of discounting, but this is the most pronounced and formalized," said <PERSON>Stuart Applebaum</PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Bantam Books Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
"I'm sure it will be very controversial in the publishing industry." 

   <PERSON>Dara Tyson</PERSON>, senior manager for public relations and promotions at <LOCATION>Stamford</LOCATION>, Conn.-based Waldenbooks, said the chain considers the program "very revolutionary. 
It represents value and spontaneous buying," she added. 

   Although the discounting will lower profit margins, it could greatly increase volume. 
Furthermore, since the books may turn over faster, the stores' inventory could change more rapidly. 
"What <PERSON>Walden</PERSON> is doing is acting like real retailers," said <PERSON>Allan Lang</PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION>International Book Marketing Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> "Instead of returning books, it will mark them down, giving customers the idea that they're getting greater value." 

   But some book sellers aren't convinced that consumers buy books the way they buy other merchandise. 
"It's an interesting gimmick, but it's just that," said <PERSON>Lawrence Abramoff</PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION>Tatnuck Bookseller &amp; Sons</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Worcester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>. 
"I don't think the public can be fooled, and if they don't want to buy a book, they won't, regardless of the price. 
If you don't want <PERSON>Sidney Sheldon</PERSON> at <MONEY>$17.95</MONEY>, you probably don't want it at <MONEY>$7.95</MONEY> either. 
You'd have to make it <MONEY>$2.50</MONEY> before the price would make any difference. 
And if you're going into <PERSON>Walden</PERSON> for the new Iacocca book, you don't want the old Iacocca book." 

   <PERSON>William Rickman</PERSON>, vice president of book merchandising at <ORGANIZATION>Kroch's &amp; Brentano's</ORGANIZATION>, a regional chain based in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, said the best impulse books are specialty books that are too expensive for many readers but could be very attractive at slightly lower prices. 
But <PERSON>Mr. Rickman</PERSON> said even big discounts won't necessarily move "leftover or would-be" best-sellers. 
"On some books, once they've had a period of selling, they aren't sellable at any price," he said.

   The best-selling hardcover book in the nation
last year was ``Cardinal of the <ORGANIZATION>Kremlin</ORGANIZATION>,'' a spy novel by <PERSON>Tom
Clancy</PERSON>, a newspaper survey shows.
   The book, about the race by a member of the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> to rescue an
American mole in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, was published in <DATE>July</DATE> and has
1,277,611 copies in print, The <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> said in today's
editions.
   Leading the nonfiction hardcover list was ``A Brief History of
Time,'' by <PERSON>Stephen W. Hawking</PERSON>, in which the author reviews efforts
to create a unified theory of quantum mechanics and general
relativity. Published in <DATE>April</DATE>, it has 825,000 copies in print.
   <PERSON>Scott Turow</PERSON>'s big-city murder tale, ``Presumed Innocent,'' was
<DATE>1988</DATE>'s best-selling paperback novel, the <ORGANIZATION>Times</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The top-selling nonfiction paperback was ``Love, Medicine &amp;
Miracles'' by <PERSON>Bernie S. Siegel</PERSON>, about the importance of the
patient's mind and emotions in the treatment of serious illness.
   The leader in the hardcover advice and miscellaneous category was
``The 8-Week Cholesterol Cure'' by <PERSON>Robert E. Kowalski</PERSON> _ which has
been on the Times' best-seller list for 82 weeks.
   <PERSON>Bill Watterson</PERSON>, creator of the <PERSON>Calvin</PERSON> and Hobbes cartoon
characters, dominated the paperback advice and miscellaneous
category, with three of his books occupying the top five slots. The
leader was his ``Something Under the Bed Is Drooling.''
   The survey was based on computer-processed sales figures from
3,000 bookstores and from representative wholesalers with more than
28,000 other retail outlets, including variety stores and
supermarkets. The figures are statistically adjusted to represent
sales in all such outlets across the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. Although several
of the books were published before last year, the sales figures used
were for <DATE>1988</DATE> only.

   The nation's largest bookseller, <LOCATION>Waldenbooks</LOCATION>, ordered ``The
Satanic Verses'' off store shelves for fear that threats of violence
against the book's author and publisher might extend to its
employees.
   But the book was missing from many bookstore shelves today for
another reason: Sales were booming.
   ``This is not a freedom of speech issue _ the sole reason is the
protection of our employees,'' <PERSON>Bonnie Predd</PERSON>, executive vice
president of Waldenbooks, said after the chain ordered its copies
removed from display <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   ``Waldenbooks has fought long and hard against censorship, but
when it comes to the safety of Waldenbooks employees and our
customers, we must act responsibly in their interests,'' said a
statement read today by <ORGANIZATION>Grace Castricone of Waldenbooks</ORGANIZATION>' marketing
department.
   Telephone calls by <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> to Waldenbooks stores
nationwide <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> found that the <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON> novel _
which provoked the Iranian leader, <PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini</PERSON>, to
call for the author's death _ was available for sale on request in a
few stores, but was not on display.
   Employees answering the telephone at most stores said they had
been instructed by corporate headquarters to say ``No comment'' to
any questions about the book.
   A woman in the president's office at <LOCATION>Stamford</LOCATION>, Conn.-based
<PERSON>Waldenbooks</PERSON> said <DATE>today</DATE> that the decision to pull the book from
public display was made <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> ``when our store managers
received some threats.''
   The woman said she wouldn't give her name, adding, ``Everybody
here is concerned about their safety.''
   In <LOCATION>Forestville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, a Waldenbooks store reported receiving a
telephone bomb threat from an unidentified man who wanted it to stop
selling the book, authorities said.
   The threat was made against the Waldenbooks at <ORGANIZATION>Landover Mall</ORGANIZATION> on
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>, said <PERSON>Prince George</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>County</LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON>Chuck Cook</PERSON>.
The store received the call from a man with a foreign accent who
said a bomb would be detonated later that day if the store didn't
pull the book from its shelves. But store officials said they never
had the novel in stock.
   Other bookstores said they couldn't keep up with demand for ``The
Satanic Verses,'' which was selling poorly before the death threat.
   ``We had a display of it for three weeks and it just sat there,''
said <PERSON>Carolyn Fenton</PERSON>, manager of Bookstop in <LOCATION>Alamo Heights</LOCATION>, a suburb
of <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. ``I can't remember selling one off it. Then,
like that, they were gone.''
   <PERSON>Brian Weese</PERSON>, general manager of Encore Books, a <LOCATION>Harrisburg</LOCATION>,
Pa.-based chain of 47 stores in the <LOCATION>Middle Atlantic States</LOCATION>, said
several of his outlets have sold out their allotment.
   ``The fist-shaking is happening elsewhere, thank God,'' <PERSON>Weese</PERSON>
said. ``The ironic thing is that it's working against what <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>
and others want to accomplish. It's piqued everyone's interest and
sparked the sales, rather than forcing people to remove it and not
sell it.''
   Seven people died this week in <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> during
riotous protests against the book, which some Moslems say blasphemes
the prophet Mohammed. The book has been banned in several countries
with mostly Moslem populations.
   Today was to be the start of an 11-city promotional tour of the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> by <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>, but the book's <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> publisher, <ORGANIZATION>Viking
Penguin Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, canceled the tour because of the threats. Rushdie, 41,
of <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION>, was reported to be in hiding.
   Viking Penguin executives were wearing bulletproof vests at the
office, the <ORGANIZATION>Daily News</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> reported today, citing
unidentified sources. And <DATE>Thursday</DATE> the company received its ninth
bomb threat since <DATE>December</DATE>. Workers were sent home and told to stay
there today, too.
   The novel, published in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in <DATE>September</DATE>, has been available
in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> for several weeks.
   About 10,000 copies of the book were distributed to Waldenbooks
stores in 660 cities nationwide, <PERSON>Predd</PERSON> said. A memorandum authorized
by <PERSON>Harry Hoffman</PERSON>, president of the company, was sent to all the
stores ordering the book off the shelves, she said.
   Viking Penguin began a second printing of the book <DATE>last week</DATE>,
according to a company spokesman. The first run was 50,000 copies.
   ``We're printing to meet demand,'' the spokesman said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
He asked that his name not be used, citing the bomb threats at the
company's <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> headquarters.
   He said the <MONEY>$19.95</MONEY> hardcover has hit four regional best-seller
lists _ in this week's <LOCATION>Chicago Tribune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>The Boston Globe</ORGANIZATION> and next
week's <LOCATION>San Francisco Chronicle</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>The Washington Post</ORGANIZATION>.
   A fast-selling book usually gets special treatment from retailers
_ window displays, a separate table or a prominent place on shelves.
Some booksellers said the uproar wouldn't deter them.
   ``No book should be banned from sale for the ideas it contains,''
said <PERSON>Michael Bills</PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION>The Harvard Book Store</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>. He said an unidentified group called him <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to urge that
an ``offensive'' <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> display be removed from the shop window,
but he refused.
   Of five large midtown <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> bookstores, only a <ORGANIZATION>Barnes &amp; Noble</ORGANIZATION>
outlet on <LOCATION>Fifth Avenue</LOCATION> had copies left <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   ``I don't have it in the window, but I have it prominently
displayed on both floors,'' said <PERSON>Alex Ostrowsky</PERSON>, the store's
assistant manager. ``There's some concern, but it's not stopping any
kind of merchandising.''
   <PERSON>Norma Carmona</PERSON>, manager of the Classic Book Shop a block away,
said she scrounged up 15 copies of the book <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> but
they were sold in hours.
   ``Everybody's talking about it, everyone wants to read it,'' she
said.

this week's <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> non-fiction best-seller list, five
notches ahead of the weightier <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> book.
   The light-hearted canine narrative held down the No. 5 spot on
the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post's best-seller list, while the former
president's 748-page memoir came in at No. 7.
   ``Millie's Book'' was brought out in <DATE>September</DATE> by <ORGANIZATION>William Morrow
&amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION> and has been perched on the best-seller charts for nine
weeks. ``An American Life'' by <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> was published just three
weeks ago.
   ``It's a bit of an unfair comparison,'' <PERSON>Jack McKeown</PERSON>, publisher
of <ORGANIZATION>Simon &amp; Schuster</ORGANIZATION>'s trade division, said <DATE>Monday</DATE>. ``We certainly
don't begrudge any success to `Millie's Book,' but they are
appealing to quite difference audiences.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Simon &amp; Schuster</ORGANIZATION> is the publisher of the <MONEY>$24.95</MONEY> Reagan
autobiography.
   ``Millie's Book'' lionizes the president's English springer
spaniel, wrapping a droll narrative of <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> life and lore
around scores of full-color pictures of <PERSON>Millie</PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION>Oval Office</ORGANIZATION>,
<PERSON>Millie</PERSON> in the <LOCATION>Lincoln Bedroom</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Millie</PERSON> mingling with celebrities,
<PERSON>George</PERSON>, <PERSON>Barbara</PERSON> and assorted grandchildren.
   All the royalties from the <MONEY>$17.95</MONEY> book are going to <PERSON>Barbara
Bush</PERSON>'s literacy foundation. <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON> penned a similar book about
an earlier pet dog, <PERSON>C. Fred Bush</PERSON>, to raise money for charity when
her husband was vice president.
   Sales of the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> book are accelerating at the major book
chains and ``all the vital signs'' point to big sales of ``An
American Life'' as a Christmas gift book, said <PERSON>McKeown</PERSON>.
   But ``Millie's Book'' is winning the race at the bookstore
nearest the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>, a Crown Books outlet on G Street, one
block away.
   ``Millie's the hottest item in the store,'' said assistant
manager <PERSON>Larry Hoffer</PERSON>. ``It's out the door. People come in and buy
10, 15 each - and then come back and buy more. It's a really cute
gift idea.''
   Some of the mega-purchases are by people with <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>
connections who can get the books ``signed'' by the first lady and
<PERSON>Millie</PERSON>, via a paw-print stamp.
   The <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> book, which has received lackluster reviews, is
selling well at Crown, ``but not as fast as <PERSON>Nancy Reagan</PERSON> did,''
said <PERSON>Hoffer</PERSON>.
   The former first lady hit the best-seller lists last year by
lashing back at critics and ungrateful children in her life story,
``My Turn.''

   B. Dalton Bookstore Chain Launches
   Program to Spur Sales of Serious Books

   NEW YORK -- The giant bookstore chains get a lot of grief
about selling books like junk food, filling up the windows
with Stephen King and Danielle Steel.
   But the B. Dalton chain has a new program designed to get
shoppers to buy more of such books as "Skywater" by Melinda
Worth Popham, a serious novel written from the point of view
of a pack of coyotes. A book like this -- without sex, drugs
or detectives, written by an unknown author and published by
a tiny, independent press -- doesn't normally have a chance
to attract wide readership. Obscure novelists who sell 5,000
copies consider themselves lucky.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Starting tomorrow, browsers at more than 250 of the 800 <PERSON>B.
Dalton</PERSON> stores across the country will find "Skywater"
displayed in a special section and recommended in a brochure
along with 28 other novels by unknown or little-known
authors. "Discover Great New Writers" is the name of the
program, and new selections will be made and promoted every
two months. Half a dozen of the titles will be chosen by the
local store manager, with the rest of the books picked by the
chain's buyers in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, after reviewing publishers'
recommendations.
   "We're certainly conscious of our image in the
marketplace," says <PERSON>Leonard Riggio</PERSON>, chief executive officer
and principal owner of <PERSON>B. Dalton</PERSON>. "We do a great job with the
cookbooks and the how-tos and the big-name authors, but we
know there is frustration on the part of authors that don't
sell. We're going to give them a shot, to express gratitude
and maybe to help discover the future's best sellers. These
shopping-center stores sell to a middle-American client and
we're trying to broaden their reading."
   As the chains, particularly <PERSON>B. Dalton</PERSON> and Waldenbooks,
expanded rapidly through the '80s until they came to
represent some <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales, publishers observed the
stores' power to make a book a best seller. Dire predictions
were uttered in publishing circles about the imminent
disappearance of serious books. Then, several years ago, a
series of very demanding fiction and non-fiction books became
surprise best sellers without the chains paying much
attention.
   It turned out that the recommendation of passionate,
book-loving, independent-bookstore owners across the country
had been the spark, and then the chains chimed in. One
example: "The Joy Luck Club," a first novel by unknown <PERSON>Amy
Tan</PERSON>, has sold more than 270,000 copies in hardcover since
<DATE>March 1989</DATE>.
   "The chains like <PERSON>B. Dalton</PERSON> are trying to pick up on what
has made some independents so successful," says <PERSON>Scott Walker</PERSON>,
founder and editorial director of <ORGANIZATION>Graywolf Press</ORGANIZATION>, which
published "Skywater," the coyote novel. "The chains are
starting to have a broader selection of titles and doing
things like more author signings and readings."
   For a small press like <PERSON>Graywolf</PERSON>, the Discover program is a
special blessing. "We don't have a big promotion budget --
almost nobody does for a first novel," says <PERSON>Mr. Walker</PERSON>. "For
some reason the word `literary' scares people, and we have to
start aggressively marketing to new audiences. I think this
program is one way to reach more readers with this type of
book."
   St. <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Minn.-based Graywolf</ORGANIZATION> publishes only about 14
titles a year, and though its promotion budget for "Skywater"
is one of its biggest, it totals just <MONEY>$7,000</MONEY>. Nationwide.
   The other titles on <PERSON>B. Dalton</PERSON>'s first "Discover" list
aren't all by small presses, though several others are
represented. But even when the book is the product of a
powerhouse publisher or is a murder mystery that might
automatically grab genre readers, its author is a virtual
unknown or first novelist. Some movie fans may know <PERSON>Hanif
Kureishi</PERSON> as the writer of such cult British movies as "My
Beautiful Laundrette," but <PERSON>Mr. Kureishi</PERSON> is hardly a household
name. "The Buddha of <LOCATION>Suburbia</LOCATION>" is his first novel.

THE FUROR OVER 'SATANIC VERSES' HAS REVIVED DEBATE ON BOOK PUBLISHING AND 
DISTRIBUTION.

<TEXT>
<P>
The decision last week by the nation's two biggest bookstore chains to pull 
<PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>'s "The Satanic Verses" from their shelves has brought a new 
outpouring of complaints about the chains' tremendous influence on how widely 
books are distributed and even which ones get published. 
</P>
<P>
On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>B. Dalton-Barnes &amp; Noble</ORGANIZATION> chain reversed its position not 
to sell the novel, and Waldenbooks has promised to resume selling the book from 
its stockroom when new copies arrive from the publisher. But all the same, many 
in the book world say the incident again demonstrates how much power the chains 
have acquired since their explosive growth began in the mid-1970s. When the 
chief executives of the two top chains yanked the book, they blocked sales in 
about 2,200 of the country's roughly 7,000 general-interest bookstores, critics 
say. 
</P>
<P>
The critics, who include writers, publishers and independent bookstore owners, 
say the chains' power is exerted quietly every day as they decide which books 
to carry. With the huge orders that they place with publishers, and with their 
enormous promotional budgets, the chains' decisions help assure that some works 
will be best sellers while others are consigned to obscurity. 
</P>
<P>
And as the chains offer their mass-market inventory at discount prices, they 
can also force out of business the independent stores that try to make their 
way selling a broader selection of less popular works, as well as blockbusters, 
the critics say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Amendment Defenders 
</P>
<P>
The chains, of course, have staunch defenders in the book industry, who see 
merit in their concern about their employees' safety and praise the big firms 
for bringing low-price works to neighborhoods that have never had book outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Since the furor over "The Satanic Verses" began last week, booksellers have 
confronted questions of whether they have an obligation to bring books -- even 
controversial ones -- before the public. Some say that they do and that the 
chains have not lived up to that obligation, as the independents have. 
</P>
<P>
"The chains are brilliant at marketing, and they've changed the face of the 
bookselling industry," said <PERSON>Mona Mangan</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Writers 
Guild of America East</ORGANIZATION>. "But they don't have that commitment to getting books 
before the public. It's the little neighborhood bookstore that's out there 
today defending the First Amendment." 
</P>
<P>
The president of the booksellers' trade group that includes the Waldenbooks and 
<ORGANIZATION>B. Dalton-Barnes &amp; Noble</ORGANIZATION> chains also said he found "some merit" in 
criticism of the chains' withdrawal of the book. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, this illustrates the Achilles' heel of centralizing the 
industry," said <PERSON>Edward Morrow</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>American Booksellers Assn.</ORGANIZATION> and 
owner of an independent store in <LOCATION>Manchester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Vt</LOCATION>. The chains' decisions meant 
that the book wouldn't be available at all in some communities, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
As the chains pulled the book, <PERSON>Morrow</PERSON> said, independent bookstores continued to 
take orders for it, including several that had received bomb threats. "I've 
talked to a lot of independent stores in the last couple of days, and I haven't 
talked to one that said it didn't want to sell the book," <PERSON>Morrow</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Remain in Stockroom 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Morrow</PERSON> and others in the book trade also saw the rationale behind the 
chains' decision. "They're extremely visible and extremely vulnerable because 
of their size and locations in so many shopping malls," <PERSON>Morrow</PERSON> said. "It's not 
as easy to ensure everybody's safety at these little outlets as it is if you 
just own one store." 
</P>
<P>
"This is not an example of the venal corporate mentality taking over the book 
business," added <PERSON>William Kramer</PERSON>, president of the two-store <PERSON>Sidney Kramer</PERSON> Books 
in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. "There are legitimate concerns at stake." 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>B. Dalton-Barnes &amp; Noble</ORGANIZATION> chain announced <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> that it 
would begin selling the book again in about 10 days, when it receives its next 
supply. The chain said it reversed the decision after a poll of employees found 
"overwhelming" support for selling the book. 
</P>
<P>
The Waldenbooks chain, which last week decided to take <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s novel off its 
shelves and sell it only on request, said it would resume selling the book when 
it comes back in stock. The chain also said it would continue "to use 
discretion in displaying the book." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, a spokesman for Waldenbooks denied that the chains have 
excessive influence on the bookselling business. "We account for only <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> of 
the books sold in this country," the spokesman said. "There are thousands of 
other places books can be sold." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<PERCENT>45%</PERCENT> Market Share 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>B. Dalton-Barnes &amp; Noble</ORGANIZATION> chain did not respond to repeated requests for 
comment, nor did Crown Books. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the comment of the Waldenbooks spokesman, the influence of the chains 
is enormous and growing, although at a slower rate than in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
If Waldenbooks accounts for only <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> of all book sales, <LOCATION>Waldenbooks</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>B. 
Dalton-Barnes &amp; Noble</ORGANIZATION> and Crown Books together account for nearly <PERCENT>45%</PERCENT> of 
the general-interest fiction and nonfiction works known as trade books, 
according to <PERSON>Jim Baker</PERSON>, editor of Publisher's Weekly. While exact figures are 
not available, the three leading chains' market share is believed to have risen 
from about <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE>, he said. 
</P>
<P>
B. <ORGANIZATION>Dalton-Barnes &amp; Noble</ORGANIZATION> has about 1,250 stores, while Waldenbooks, a unit 
of K mart, has about 1,200. Crown operates about 200 stores. 
</P>
<P>
The chains' influence has been felt in many ways by authors, publishers and 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
They have brought a new management expertise to the business, with slick 
promotion and marketing techniques, computerized inventory control and other 
features that make traditional booksellers look stodgy and outdated. With the 
chains' backing, a book's sales can quickly climb into the hundreds of 
thousands. 
</P>
<P>
But without the chains, publishers and authors lose their access to huge chunks 
of the American audience. And this often makes them desperate to get their 
books onto the chains' shelves. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blockbuster Syndrome 
</P>
<P>
Without a large chain order, "you have to consider whether you can raise the 
price for each copy of the book" to cover costs, says <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> publisher 
<PERSON>Jeremy P. Tarcher</PERSON>, who heads a firm that bears his name. Or "you may decide 
that, with such a small press run, the book just isn't economically viable" and 
decide not to publish. 
</P>
<P>
Writers complain that the rise of the chains has increased publishers' interest 
in the mass-market blockbuster at the expense of worthy books that might 
interest a smaller group. 
</P>
<P>
"The publishers were always interested in promoting the potential blockbuster 
at the expense of other books, but the chains have made it worse," said <PERSON>Alec 
Dubro</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>National Writers Union</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The chains' emphasis on the potential blockbuster often comes at the expense of 
so-called mid-list books, which are neither the best sellers ("front list") nor 
classics ("back list.") These can be the work of first-time or less well known 
authors. 
</P>
<P>
For the most efficient use of display space, the chains also typically keep 
books in inventory for shorter periods, to the dismay of writers and 
publishers. 
</P>
<P>
And the chains' presence can put pressure on small publishers, though most 
small publishers aim at narrow rather than mass markets. 
</P>
<P>
Small publishers are confronted with a dilemma when the chains offer them a 
large order. If they decline to accept the full order, they may risk losing 
future business from the chain; if they accept the full order, they may later 
face the crushing expense of a large number of returned copies. 
</P>
<P>
"A giant leaves large footprints," said publisher <PERSON>Tarcher</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unfair Treatment Charged 
</P>
<P>
Independent bookstores have long complained about the difficulties of competing 
in a world where the chains have narrowed profit margins to razor-thin size. 
"You've got to love books to be an independent, because there's just not that 
much money in it," said <PERSON>Glenn Goldman</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Book Soup</ORGANIZATION>, a bookstore in 
<LOCATION>West Hollywood</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Last <DATE>December</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Trade Commission</ORGANIZATION> sided with independent booksellers 
when it filed complaints against six of the largest trade publishers for 
allegedly selling hardback books at lower prices to chain stores than to 
independents. The agency also charged that the publishers treated the chains 
better in joint advertising programs and in providing promotional displays. The 
publishers have denied the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Book lovers have sometimes found that their sympathies lie with the independent 
bookstores in their competition with the chains. When the elegant, 75-year-old 
<ORGANIZATION>Scribner</ORGANIZATION>'s bookstore on <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s Fifth Avenue closed last <DATE>December</DATE>, some book 
lovers took it as another sign of the decline of the old-fashioned bookstore -- 
though the store had recently carried only a limited inventory. 
</P>
<P>
But the chains' admirers argue that the growth of the chains has brought stores 
to many neighborhoods that had no book outlets and reduced book prices to 
within the reach of many who could not afford them in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in the past several years, there has been a resurgence of the 
independent bookstores, though there are no firm statistics to describe the 
trend precisely. This is partially attributed to a greater interest in books 
among the aging baby boom generation. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some industry officials, pointing to the slowing growth of the chains, 
believe that their importance may decline in the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"Big companies like <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>RCA</ORGANIZATION> got into the book business and got right out of 
it when they discovered it was no gold mine," said <PERSON>Jack Shoemaker</PERSON>, 
editor-in-chief of <ORGANIZATION>North Point Press</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. In the years ahead, 
"corporate <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> may get out and leave it entirely to the little guy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE BIG GET BIGGER 
</P>
<P>
The three largest bookstore chains have steadily increased their market share 
in the period between <DATE>1980</DATE> and <DATE>1987</DATE>. Percentages are based on total retail 
revenue (including trade, mass market and religious book sales) of <MONEY>$2.3 billion</MONEY> 
in <DATE>1980</DATE> and <MONEY>$3.8 billion</MONEY> in <DATE>1987</DATE>.

   Lavish Beyond Belief]
   For the nation's book publishers, that sums up the price
of hype these days. Complain though they might about
dwindling profit margins, companies are spending more than
ever on advertising and promotion budgets for major books.
   <ORGANIZATION>Warner Books</ORGANIZATION> has never spent as much to market a book as
the <MONEY>$600,000</MONEY> earmarked to launch this <DATE>fall</DATE>'s sequel to "Gone
With The Wind." Viking Penguin will spend in excess of
<MONEY>$750,000</MONEY> promoting <PERSON>Stephen King</PERSON>'s next novel, even though he
is already one of the top-selling authors in publishing
history. <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> is pitching a thriller called
"Patriots" with ads on radio and cable television, plus a
money-back guarantee -- very rare for a hardcover book.
   And <ORGANIZATION>Simon &amp; Schuster</ORGANIZATION> spent plenty attempting to have <PERSON>Mary
Higgins Clark</PERSON>'s latest thriller, "Loves Music, Loves to
Dance," make its first appearance on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION>'
best-seller list in the No. 1 spot. To that end, <ORGANIZATION>Simon &amp;
Schuster</ORGANIZATION> mounted a major campaign that included store
displays, bus ads and network television commercials -- still
fairly rare for books -- on top of a 16-city author tour. And
it worked: "Loves Music" started on top and has been the
top-selling novel on the Times list for six weeks.
   Compared with budgets for movies and consumer products,
these amounts may seem insignificant. But by publishing
standards they are huge: Publishers say the usual marketing
budget for an anticipated best seller is more like <MONEY>$200,000</MONEY>,
while the average "midlist" book by a little-known author is
lucky to get a budget of <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY>. Publishers aren't about to
routinely spend big money on expensive media like television;
and for most nonfiction, publishers say publicity is far more
effective than advertising.
   But there are several changes in the book business that
compel publishers to spend so lavishly in tight times for
some titles. For starters, competition is fiercer than ever:
The '80s created a number of merged megapublishers who paid
staggering advances for brand-name authors. As these books
come out, publishers can only make money if sales are
staggering, too. With the recession, sales have been sluggish
lately even for best sellers.
   Also adding pressure is the increasing computerization of
bookstores. Stores now have a much better grasp of what is
selling; what isn't gets shipped back more quickly. If
publishers wait for word-of-mouth to build sales gradually, a
book may be gone from stores by the time it's popular.
   "As publishers, we are all very conscious of the shortened
shelf life of hardcover books," says <PERSON>Jack McKeown</PERSON>, publisher
of trade, or general-interest, books for <ORGANIZATION>Simon &amp; Schuster</ORGANIZATION>, a
unit of <ORGANIZATION>Paramount Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "Computers have brought
many blessings to the bookselling industry, but booksellers
are tempted to drop quickly what doesn't move. It has become
extremely important to maximize sales in the first three,
four weeks."
   Publishers attempt to "leverage" their big authors,
ratcheting up the awareness and sales level with each new
book, which also often requires stepped-up ad spending. In
the case of "Loves Music," <PERSON>Ms. Clark</PERSON>'s eighth novel, <ORGANIZATION>Simon &amp;
Schuster</ORGANIZATION> wanted to outsell the previous one, which took
several weeks to reach No. 1 and only stayed for two weeks,
says <PERSON>Mr. McKeown</PERSON>.
   "Our objective this time was to start her at No. 1, which
is very hard to do," says <PERSON>Mr. McKeown</PERSON>. "We feel there will be
a payoff for our advertising commitment down the road in
increased sales," he says. When a writer hits a certain level
of mass popularity, all of his or her earlier titles are
often re-released in paperback, and sales of the writer's
whole body of work rise across the board.
   <ORGANIZATION>Simon &amp; Schuster</ORGANIZATION> had experimented with television ads on
<PERSON>Ms. Clark</PERSON>'s previous novel and tracked the sales rise in the
four markets where the TV ads ran. This time, ads ran in
eight cities during morning talk shows for two weeks,
starting the day books landed in stores. The 15-second spot
dramatized the plot, about a serial killer who stalks his
victims through the personal ads: The commercial showed a
newspaper ad, a couple dancing and the woman's dead body.
"Meeting <PERSON>Mr. Right</PERSON> can be murder," says an announcer, a line
also featured in ads inside 500 buses traversing greater <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION>.
   "Everything clicked," says <PERSON>Mr. McKeown</PERSON>. "On a week-to-week
comparison at the national chains, her sales are running <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT>
ahead of the previous book." He won't divulge the total cost
of the marketing and promotion campaign but says the
television time alone cost more than <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY>.
   Given his legions of passionate fans, <PERSON>Stephen King</PERSON>'s new
novel, "Needful Things" probably doesn't need any promotion
to start out as a No. 1 best seller, but his publisher plans
a massive campaign. "We've always spent a lot promoting
<PERSON>Stephen King</PERSON>," says <PERSON>Michael Jacobs</PERSON>, president of <PERSON>Viking
Penguin</PERSON>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Pearson PLC.</ORGANIZATION> "Every time we do an
innovative ad campaign, we add new readers. We want to
increase the sales of hardcover copies with each title."
   Weeks before the <DATE>Sept. 30</DATE> publication date, bookstores
will be sent counter-top displays with cards that allow King
fans to reserve their copy of the book, a growing practice
with hot titles. Readers who pre-order will be sent a post
card when the books arrive, plus an as-yet-undetermined
souvenir.
   Later, large cardboard bins called "dumps" will be
distributed to 5,000 stores to display the book in bulk. For
the entire month of <DATE>October</DATE>, transit ads will run on buses
and subways in three cities. There will also be a billboard
-- another medium publishers are using more -- along <LOCATION>Los
Angeles</LOCATION>' <LOCATION>Sunset Boulevard</LOCATION>. Print advertising will include
teasers in newspapers in eight major cities, running three
days in a row just before the book goes on sale.
   With "Scarlett: the Sequel to <PERSON>Margaret Mitchell</PERSON>'s Gone
With the Wind," <ORGANIZATION>Warner Books</ORGANIZATION> says it must spend heavily to
announce the book because its contents are being tightly
guarded. "Since no one has read it and there's no
word-of-mouth, we have to take extra measures so that people
know it's available," says <PERSON>Nanscy Neiman</PERSON>, publisher of the
<ORGANIZATION>Time Warner Inc.</ORGANIZATION> unit.
   The <MONEY>$600,000</MONEY> budget is Warner Books' biggest ever for
advertising and promotion, but <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> reportedly paid <MONEY>$5
million</MONEY> just for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Canadian rights and plans an
ambitious initial run of 500,000 copies. The book was delayed
a year amid rumors of problems, but the publisher insists
"Scarlett" is a great read with a built-in audience. Still,
author <PERSON>Alexandra Ripley</PERSON>, despite three previous best-selling
paperback romances, is hardly a household name.
   To get the word out, <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> plans a 30-second television
commercial to run in major markets during talk shows, soap
operas and some prime-time shows as the book arrives in
stores in late <DATE>September</DATE>. <PERSON>Ms. Neiman</PERSON> will only say that the
spot will be "romantic and wonderful."
   In addition, <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> plans an extensive print-ad campaign
in popular magazines like People, with lots of newspaper ads,
especially in the South. As with the King book, readers will
be encouraged to pre-order the book in stores. And bookstores
will be sent red buttons for clerks to wear. The button's
slogan, playing off the last line of "Gone With the Wind,"
tells customers: "Tomorrow is here at last . . . ."

<HEAD>Bookstore Chain Proclaims Position on `The Satanic Verses'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A bookstore chain that initially withdrew ``The Satanic Verses''
from its shelves for fear of terrorist attack went on the offensive
today, saying it will continue to sell the book despite ``many
threats of violence.''
   Waldenbooks, one of the nation's largest chains, ran
advertisements in nine newspapers defending its decision to stop
displaying the book, which has been condemned by Moslems worldwide.
   ``We will continue to sell the book when it comes back in stock
at the publisher,'' declared the ads, signed by <PERSON>Harry Hoffman</PERSON>,
president and chief executive officer of the chain. ``We will
continue to use discretion in displaying the book.''
   The advertisement is headlined ``A Statement of Fact in Troubled
Times.''
   Two other large book chains, <PERSON>B. Dalton</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Barnes &amp; Noble</ORGANIZATION>,
briefly stopped selling `The Satanic Verses'' after <PERSON>Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini</PERSON>, the Iranian leader, called for the execution of
its author, British novelist <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>, and those responsible
for its publication. Those stores resumed sales of the book
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> after nationwide protests.
   Waldenbooks ordered the book removed from store shelves <DATE>last
Friday</DATE>, but said its managers could sell it from behind the counter.
   Today's advertisement cited ``the many threats of violence made
against our stores and our people.'' A Waldenbooks spokeswoman,
<PERSON>Tracy Urdan</PERSON>, said the chain received an estimated 60 bomb threats in
the first days after the death threat was issued.
   All three of the large chains were criticized by writers' groups
for engaging in a form of censorship, but <PERSON>Hoffman</PERSON> insisted that his
employees' safety was the real issue.
   In any case, <PERSON>Ms. Urdan</PERSON> said, ``The question is moot for the time
being because there are no more books in stock and there won't be
until <DATE>March 10</DATE>.''
   Viking Penguin, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> publisher of ``The Satanic Verses,'' is
reportedly printing 15,000 copies and has plans for another 50,000
within two weeks, The <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> reported today.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Times</ORGANIZATION> said an unidentified book wholesaler predicted the book
would sell 500,000 copies in hardcover, making it a huge best-seller.
   In <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, speakers at a rally <DATE>Thursday</DATE> urged people to buy the
book to register support for <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>.
   ``Let's not be stampeded by this kind of intellectual terrorism.
Let's vote with our wallets. Buy (<PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s) book,'' said <PERSON>Larry
Heinemann</PERSON>, winner of the <DATE>1987</DATE> National Book Award for his novel
``Paco's Story.''
   Speaking to more than 300 fellow writers and supporters at the
<ORGANIZATION>Chicago Public Library's Cultural Center</ORGANIZATION>, celebrated <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>
Sun-Times gossip columnist <PERSON>Irv Kupcinet</PERSON> said, ``If good people don't
stand up and act ... evil takes over.''
   A small group of <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> Moslems attended the rally, handing out
brochures condemning <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s book for insulting Islam in a manner
that ``scandalizes and maligns'' Muslims' beliefs.
   ``We don't agree with the death threat or the bounty,'' said
<PERSON>Mohammad Kaiseruddin</PERSON>, president of <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Muslim Community
Center</ORGANIZATION>. ``But we are still very offended by passages in `The Satanic
Verses' that use profanity to describe the prophets <PERSON>Abraham</PERSON> and
Mohammed.''
   The Indian-born <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>, 4l, went into hiding in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> <DATE>last
week</DATE> after learning of <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s death threat.

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Ann Getty</PERSON>, wife of one of the world's richest
men, had a problem: She loved to read all day, but she also
believed in the Protestant work ethic.
   ``I come from nice Puritan stock, and I grew up believing that
you have to work all day,'' she explained.
   <PERSON>Lord Weidenfeld</PERSON>, one of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s most distinguished publishers,
also had a problem: He had been wanting to break into American
publishing for 20 years. But where would he get the money?
   It seemed <PERSON>Getty</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Weidenfeld</ORGANIZATION> had solved their problems in <DATE>1985</DATE>
when they teamed up to buy <ORGANIZATION>Grove Press</ORGANIZATION> and start <ORGANIZATION>Weidenfeld &amp;
Nicholson New York</ORGANIZATION>, a medium-size, independent publisher of quality
books.
   But <DATE>five years later Grove-Weidenfeld</DATE> was put up for auction,
like some paperback rights routinely are. As losses approached <MONEY>$15
million</MONEY>, <ORGANIZATION>Getty</ORGANIZATION>'s financial advisers reportedly told the voracious
reader her job was prohibitively expensive.
   The story of Grove-Weidenfeld is merely one trauma in what
<ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> executive <PERSON>Peter Osnos</PERSON> has described as ``a season of
anxiety in publishing.''
   The source of the anxiety is money _ big, corporate,
international money, and its transformation of what had been a
small industry run and staffed by people who cared as much about
literary quality as profit.
   Almost every famous name in publishing now has a famous business
name behind it: <ORGANIZATION>Simon &amp; Schuster</ORGANIZATION> (owed by <ORGANIZATION>Paramount
Communications</ORGANIZATION>), <PERSON>Harper</PERSON> &amp; Row (<ORGANIZATION>Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>),
<ORGANIZATION>MacMillan Co.</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Robert Maxwell Publications</ORGANIZATION>), Little <PERSON>Brown</PERSON>
(<ORGANIZATION>Time-Warner Inc.</ORGANIZATION>), <ORGANIZATION>William Morrow &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Hearst Corp.</ORGANIZATION>).
   Indeed, ``Corporate Takeover of the Word'' was the title of a
recent writers conference at <ORGANIZATION>New York University</ORGANIZATION>. ``I'm struck by
the level of concern, that 120 people would spend a sunny <DATE>Saturday</DATE>
indoors talking about the publishing industry,'' says <PERSON>Alec Dubro</PERSON>,
president of the <ORGANIZATION>National Writers Union</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``If an author is very concerned about the handling of a book,
about its content, he or she is being driven away from the major
publishers,'' he adds. ``The majors are perceived as being far more
homogenized and commercialized than they once were.''
   The complaint, which is difficult to document, runs like this:
Corporations want books that earn quick profits, create little
controversy and accord deferential treatment to any person, product
or cause that it or its subsidiaries hold dear.
   However limited their grasp of literature, corporate managers
can usually read a balance sheet, and it is to this _ not ideology
or censorship _ that much of the season's anxiety can be traced.
   <ORGANIZATION>Simon &amp; Schuster</ORGANIZATION> posted pre-tax losses of <MONEY>$140 million</MONEY>, and the
chairman of <DATE>Doubleday</DATE> was forced out because of financial problems
there. Harcourt <PERSON>Brace Jovanovich</PERSON> borrowed <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY> to fend off a
takeover bid, raising questions if the company can meet its
interest payments, let alone invest in its future.
   The predictable corporate response to such conditions: Smaller
advances for authors; layoffs for employees; and, since only two
books in 10 make money, fewer new titles for the public. According
to preliminary figures compiled by Publishers Weekly, new title
output declined by about <PERCENT>4 percent</PERCENT> last year.
   So far, the most notable casualty of the money crunch has been
Pantheon Books, a <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary long known for its
intellectually challenging books on a variety of subjects.
   In <DATE>February</DATE>, <PERSON>Andre Schiffrin</PERSON> resigned as Pantheon's managing
director rather than accept orders from <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> (itself a
subsidiary of the <PERSON>Newhouse</PERSON> family's <ORGANIZATION>Advance Publications</ORGANIZATION>) to
publish fewer books. At this, several authors defected, six senior
editors resigned and several hundred members of the literary
community demonstrated on the street outside <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION>'s offices.
   Whatever the merits of its books, Pantheon had lost <MONEY>$3 million</MONEY>
last year on sales of <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY>. The demonstrators said <ORGANIZATION>Random
House</ORGANIZATION> should absorb Pantheon's losses, but industry sources say
<ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> made little or no profit in <DATE>1989</DATE>. Advance's <ORGANIZATION>S.I.
Newhouse</ORGANIZATION> insisted Pantheon pay its own way, saying, ``I do not like
charity cases.''
   Publishing's crisis has its roots in the <DATE>1950s</DATE>, when the heart
of the retail book market moved from a relatively few, large city
bookstores to many more smaller ones in suburban shopping centers.
   By the late '70s, bookstore chains, such as Waldenbooks and <PERSON>B.
Dalton Bookseller</PERSON>, were adding hundreds of new stores a year, and
they featured hardcover best sellers at discounted prices. Readers
who once waited for best sellers to come out in paperback could now
snap up the new <PERSON>Tom Clancy</PERSON> or <PERSON>Danielle Steele</PERSON> for only a few
dollars more than they would pay for the paperback a year later.
   The hardcover best seller became the industry's cash cow, but it
also changed the relationship between some best-selling authors and
their publishers. What had been a sort of marriage, for better or
worse, evolved into a temporary alliance based on the highest bid.
And as long as new stores kept opening, no bid seemed too high.
   Shopping mall construction and bookstore openings slowed over
the <DATE>last five years</DATE>, but literary agents continued to demand
ever-larger advances and guarantees.
   <PERSON>Jason Epstein</PERSON>, a top editor at <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION>, cites <PERSON>Stephen
King</PERSON>'s sales figures to illustrate the consequences.
   In <DATE>1985</DATE>, <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s ``Skeletn Crew'' sold 720,000 copies; <DATE>two years
later</DATE>, as chain store volume was peaking, sales of his
``Tommyknockers'' doubled to 1.4 million copies. Last year,
however, only 1.6 million copies of <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s new novel, ``The Dark
Half,'' were shipped to retailers, and many of those were returned.
   With fewer stores opening, there is no way sales of ``The Dark
Half'' can exceed those of <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s previous novels at anything like
the rate at which sales of ``Tommyknockers'' exceeded those of
``Skeleton Crew.'' Yet for ``The Dark Half'' and <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s next three
novels, <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s publisher is said to have guaranteed between <MONEY>$35
million</MONEY> and <MONEY>$40 million</MONEY> _ ``sums that presuppose a continually
expanding market,'' <PERSON>Epstein</PERSON> says.
   Even in this inflationary atmosphere, Grove-Weidenfeld was
conspicuous, as one observer put it, for ``noisily slapping money
down on the table.'' One of its editors was quoted as saying,
``They have given me a very big budget to acquire very big books.''
   Very big sales, however, proved more elusive. <PERSON>Shana Alexander</PERSON>
was paid <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> for a book on the Pizza Connection heroin trial,
but booksellers sold only 26,000 of a 100,000-copy printing and
sent the rest back.
   On <DATE>Feb. 27</DATE>, the same day <PERSON>Schiffrin</PERSON> resigned at <LOCATION>Pantheon</LOCATION>,
Grove-Weidenfeld was put up for sale. Potential bidders were
reported to include the usual corporate subsidiaries, including
<PERSON>MacMillan</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Harper &amp; Row</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Simon &amp; Schuster</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION>.
   But two months later <PERSON>Getty</PERSON> said the firm would not be sold
because of ``the strong feeling among authors, agents and
booksellers that we should not be swallowed by a publishing
conglomerate.''
   In fact, according to industry sources, the conglomerates
decided Grove was indigestible.
   The publishing house once described as ``famous for low sales
and high advances'' had failed to elicit a decent bid.

NATION'S BOOKSELLERS BATTLE BACK IN FACE OF THREATS, FIREBOMBINGS

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Just inside Cody's Books in <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> stands a charred rack of shelves, filled 
with blackened books that no one will ever read. Owner <PERSON>Andy Ross</PERSON> has decided to 
keep it there, a stark reminder of the morning that a Molotov cocktail was 
hurled through the window, setting the bookstore on fire. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people want to leave it for time immemorial," the shop owner said, nearly 
a month after the pre-dawn incident. "They want to shellac it and leave it, 
like a museum piece." 
</P>
<P>
The bombing of <ORGANIZATION>Cody</ORGANIZATION>'s sent new waves of concern into a book industry already 
beset by threats and protests over <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>'s novel, "The Satanic 
Verses," the work that provoked death threats for its alleged blaspheming of 
the Muslim religion. In the days before and after the bombing, the industry in 
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> seemed under siege: Already, the nation's two largest bookstore chains 
had briefly pulled the novel from their shelves. Bombings similar to the one at 
<ORGANIZATION>Cody</ORGANIZATION>'s occurred at another bookstore in <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> and at a New York-based 
newspaper that had praised the book. Pundits predicted a long-term chilling 
effect in the book market for other works that might stir controversy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Show of Unity 
</P>
<P>
Yet already there are signs -- like the memorial at <ORGANIZATION>Cody</ORGANIZATION>'s -- that the industry 
will carry on as always. With an unusual show of unity, members of the 
bookselling industry have battled back against the threats of violence and 
censorship. Publishers, writers and booksellers -- who vowed soon after the 
bombing to take a stand in support of Rushdie -- are generally following 
through on that promise now that the novel is becoming widely available. 
</P>
<P>
With sales booming, "The Satanic Verses" reached No. 1 last week on the <LOCATION>Los 
Angeles</LOCATION> Times best-seller list and is expected to hit the top this week on the 
<ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> list. At the same time, bookstores and libraries in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> 
and <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> are at last filling their shelves as overdue shipments have begun 
to pour in. Most stores, including the two that were bombed in <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>, are 
eagerly pressing ahead with sales while remaining on guard against further 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
"From the very beginning, everyone's feeling here was that we wanted to carry 
and display the book," said <PERSON>Steven Root</PERSON>, assistant manager of Waldenbooks in 
<LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>, which was firebombed on the same morning that Cody's was hit. 
</P>
<P>
The Waldenbooks outlet, which was only slightly damaged, had been trying vainly 
to acquire copies of the novel ever since the firebombing, and the late 
shipments finally arrived last week. The store filled about 75 back orders and 
put an 20 additional copies on display. The <MONEY>$19.95</MONEY> book is being discounted to 
<MONEY>$16</MONEY> at the small shop and is being handled much like any other new release, 
<PERSON>Root</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Security Measures 
</P>
<P>
However, the store has hired a security guard in the wake of the bombing and is 
cautiously keeping the novel out of its window display. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided we weren't going to do anything to flaunt it," Root said of the 
book. "We don't want to provoke or inflame anyone's feelings or sensitivities 
about it. We certainly don't want to put a poster in the window saying, 'Break 
Me.' " 
</P>
<P>
At Waldenbooks stores in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, most employees would not comment on the 
book's sales, but, similar to the <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> store, Waldenbooks in <LOCATION>Fashion Valley</LOCATION> 
is not flaunting the book in its window. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot behind the counter, but we don't have them in the window . . . 
," said <PERSON>Kathleen Shumate</PERSON>, assistant manager of the store. "My manager is 
willing to have the book out (on display)," but not in the window, she said. 
"Another Waldenbooks store put it in their window and the mall asked them to 
remove it." 
</P>
<P>
The store, which has had the book in stock only for the past week, has sold 
about 50 copies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Poll of Employees 
</P>
<P>
At <ORGANIZATION>Cody</ORGANIZATION>'s, the 55 employees took a poll before deciding to go ahead with sales, 
keenly aware of the questions of free speech and personal safety. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Crown Books in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> also were interested in what their 
employees had to say. The assistant manager of Crown Books on <PERSON>Rosecrans Avenue</PERSON>, 
who would identify himself only as Alan, said that Crown Books' executives sent 
a letter to employees asking if they had objections to selling the book. 
</P>
<P>
The seven employees of his store had no objections, and <PERSON>Alan</PERSON> said that although 
the company's gesture was "thoughtful," he admitted he had some trepidation. "I 
couldn't say for the manager, but if the store was threatened, I'd think twice 
about having it here, yes. But we (employees) signed an agreement that would 
allow the sale to go on. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to have the book behind the counter, and you had to come in and ask 
for it. Now it's out on display, in plain view in back of the store with our 
other best sellers," he said. "But it's not in the window. We don't want 
someone to throw a bomb through the window while we're gone." 
</P>
<P>
Sales are still high for the book, noting that the store has sold about 100 
copies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'True to Principles' 
</P>
<P>
Like its <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> rival, Cody's is proceeding gingerly. The store has hired 
additional security guards and closed one of its two entrances as precautionary 
measures. No longer does it display a wall poster vowing to defy <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s 
critics, as it once did. 
</P>
<P>
"We've come to the point where you put your life on the line in order to carry 
a book," said one company spokesman, who asked not to be identified. "We are 
being true to our principles, and I think most booksellers are. When the story 
is told, I think booksellers are going to be the heroes in this thing." 
</P>
<P>
Concern over how the book would be handled has been prevalent since 
mid-February, when <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini</PERSON> denounced "The Satanic 
Verses" as blasphemous to the Islamic faith and called for the death of <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> 
and "others" associated with the novel. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction of the nation's two largest bookstore chains -- <PERSON>B. Dalton</PERSON> and 
Waldenbooks -- was to immediately pull the book from the shelves out of fear 
for the safety of employees. Days later, under pressure from employees and 
writers' groups, the chains reversed their stance and allowed the book to be 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
Then, however, on <DATE>Feb. 28</DATE>, came the <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> store bombings. A firebomb ignited 
the same day also gutted the offices of <ORGANIZATION>Riverdale Press</ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based 
weekly newspaper that had written an editorial in support of Rushdie. Cody's in 
<LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> had widely advertised the novel in the days just before the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worry About Future Books 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in any of the three incidents, but writers' groups quickly 
forecast a long-term chilling effect, particularly for books, like <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s, 
that might address Islamic themes. <PERSON>Joanne Leedom-Ackerman</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>PEN 
Center USA West</ORGANIZATION>, a 500-member writers' organization based in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, 
predicted that influence would affect writers, publishers and booksellers 
alike. 
</P>
<P>
"How ready might the next publisher be to publish a book that might offend a 
Muslim group?" she asked. "We've seen historically that . . . when there is 
risk, people do what they can to hedge themselves." 
</P>
<P>
But the book industry responded almost at once. 
</P>
<P>
Writers, publishers and sellers vowed to keep the book available to the public. 
Rushdie's publishing house, <PERSON>Viking Penguin</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, quickly sold out its 
first run of 50,000 copies and made plans for additional printings. A two-week 
delay in gaining press time was responsible for a widespread shortage of "The 
Satanic Verses" earlier this month, according to a Viking spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
But since then, the publishing house has been printing to keep up with demand, 
the spokesman said. Although the company will not disclose how many additional 
copies are being printed, Viking has carried on despite a wave of threats 
against the publishing house. The company's <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> offices have been 
evacuated 12 times since <DATE>December</DATE> because of bomb threats motivated by the 
book, said the spokesman, who asked not to be named for fear of his own safety. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the threats have come since mid-February, when <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON> issued his 
death decree. 
</P>
<P>
"After a while, you get tired of leaving the building," the spokesman 
commented. "But you don't want to stay there and have that be the one time 
there is a bomb." 
</P>
<P>
The evacuations forced the hiring of additional security guards and required 
the close protection of high-ranking executives, the spokesman added. Mail had 
to be closely watched and checked for explosives. 
</P>
<P>
By one estimate, the firm so far has received 100,000 letters of protest from 
Muslims, more than a few of which have contained threats, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"In all likelihood, we won't make any money off the book if one factors in the 
tremendous amount of money we've had to spend . . . on security," he said. "Our 
top priorities have been keeping the book in print and making sure nobody gets 
hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Although most <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> bookstores did not receive any threats, some, like 
Crown Books and Waldenbooks, have retained security companies that their 
employees can call if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
But, as <PERSON>Conrad Jansen</PERSON>, acting manager for Crown Books on <ORGANIZATION>El Cajon Boulevard</ORGANIZATION>, 
said, "We're here to sell books. I know I wouldn't pull the book, but I'm just 
acting manager right now. If it came down to it right now, I wouldn't pull it, 
but I'm not going to hold my breath. If someone tells me to do it, I'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Sally Goodell</PERSON>, owner of the The Book Nook in <LOCATION>El Centro</LOCATION>, said that even if she 
had gotten threats and wanted to pull the book, "I would have been forced to 
leave it on the shelf. You have to take a stand someplace. You may be afraid, 
but it would just be something we'd have to do," she said. "It's necessary and 
it's important to let people know that we sell it." 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, perhaps the most defiant stance was taken by Book Soup, on 
<LOCATION>Sunset Boulevard</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>West Hollywood</LOCATION>. Owner <PERSON>Glenn Goldman</PERSON> published a newspaper 
ad prior to the <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> bombings, saying: "Book Soup supports freedom of 
expression and the public's right to read whatever it chooses. We will not bow 
to pressure from any quarter." 
</P>
<P>
The bombings did not change <ORGANIZATION>Goldman</ORGANIZATION>'s position. Afterward, his store was 
selling a waist-high stack of the books.

<P>
<PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON>'s new book, "Surviving at the Top," has toppled from the <ORGANIZATION>New York 
Times</ORGANIZATION>' best-seller list after just seven weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Now its publisher, <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION>, may be stuck with tens of thousands of unsold 
copies, the <ORGANIZATION>Times</ORGANIZATION> reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Trump's first book, "The Art of the Deal" in <DATE>1987</DATE>, stayed on the best-seller 
list for 48 weeks. Based on that success, <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> published and 
distributed nearly 500,000 copies of the new book and paid Trump an advance 
estimated at <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY>, the <ORGANIZATION>Times</ORGANIZATION> said. 
</P>
<P>
Initially brisk sales since publication two months ago propelled "Surviving at 
the Top" to the No. 1 spot for two weeks, but the book fell from the 
best-seller list released <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is bombing heavily," said <PERSON>Carla Bayha</PERSON>, a purchaser for <ORGANIZATION>Book Inventory 
Systems</ORGANIZATION>, a company that buys books for 23 independent stores. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Alberto Vitale</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> chief executive, said, "From the financial point 
of view, it has not been a disaster. And even if it does prove a mistake, 
that's publishing." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Trump</PERSON> said he is delighted with the book's sales. "I think it's great," he 
said. He said <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> had told him it expects to sell as many as 250,000 
copies. The Times estimated sales so far at nearly 80,000 copies.

<TEXT>
   In the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>, a thread of fear surfaces wherever ``The Satanic
Verses'' is concerned.
   University students in <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>, planned a public reading
but called it off after anonymous bomb threats were made. In the
French edition of the book, the translator's name is nowhere to be
seen. The West German edition was put out by a consortium of 90
publishers, to make it harder for terrorists to identify a target.
   Assassins killed the moderate imam, or prayer leader, of a mosque
in <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> and his aide <DATE>March 29</DATE>. Imam Abdullah al-Ahdal had
criticized the death sentence imposed by <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>.
   On <DATE>Aug. 3</DATE> a bomb killed a man in a <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> hotel and an Islamic
group claimed the man was preparing to use the bomb against <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>.
   On <DATE>Sept. 13</DATE>, a bomb caused minor damage at a bookstore owned by
<PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s publisher, the Viking Penguin group, in <LOCATION>York</LOCATION>. The store
was closed at the time and there were no injuries. Another bomb was
defused the same day at another Viking Penguin bookstore in
<LOCATION>Guildford</LOCATION>.
   The office of the weekly newspaper The <ORGANIZATION>Riverdale Press</ORGANIZATION> in the
<LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, was firebombed <DATE>Feb. 28</DATE> after publishing an editorial
defending ``The Satanic Verses.'' Two bookstores in <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, were firebombed the same day, and five stores in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> were
bombed from <DATE>April 9</DATE> to <DATE>Sept. 3</DATE> in attacks that authorities said
could be related to the book.
   A Dutch retail chain stopped selling the book <DATE>Aug. 31</DATE> after
receiving a threat, and dozens of bookstores across <LOCATION>Westesn Europe</LOCATION>
keep it under the counter or have refused to stock it.
   Islamic fundamentalists have said the death threat can be lifted
only if Rushdie admits he sinned and every copy of the book is
burned. Rushdie apologized <DATE>Feb. 18</DATE> for any offense to Moslems, but
he refused to recant, and it is clearly too late to withdraw the
book.
   It has been on best-seller lists in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> since its
publication and has gone into multiple printings there.
   More than 1.1 million hardback copies have been sold worldwide,
including more than 600,000 in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, said sources at
Viking Penguin, and translations have been published or are
appearing soon in nine European countries.
   The uproar has made it ``book of the year,'' said <PERSON>Remo Croce</PERSON>,
president of <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Booksellers Association</ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, it is
publisher <PERSON>Christian Bourgois</PERSON>' biggest commercial success, said an
aide.
   In <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, the novel has been on best-seller lists for eight
months, and anti-censorship groups are anxious to see it in
paperback.
   ``If the paperback does not come out, that is creeping
censorship,'' said <PERSON>Frances D'Souza</PERSON>, director of Article 19, a
London-based free-speech organization that has collected 12,000
signatures worldwide, many from major writers, on a petition for
<PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>.
   But <PERSON>Kalim Siddiqui</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Moslem Institute</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>,
said there will be no letup in the campaign against the book.
   ``Rushdie will serve a very long life sentence protected by the
British government,'' he said in an interview. ``His own plight is a
very small part of the total misery he has caused.''
   The 46-nation <ORGANIZATION>Organization of Islamic Conference</ORGANIZATION> has banned the
book, along with <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> was the only
conference member that unequivocally supported <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s death
threat. The others said <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> should first be tried by an Islamic
court.
   Islamic leaders say the affair has worsened the alienation of
<LOCATION>Western Europe</LOCATION>'s 5 million Moslems. Firebombs have been thrown at
two mosques in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and ugly rumblings have come from the
European far right, demanding the expulsion of Moslems.
   Rushdie has given no interviews. Friends say he is coping well
despite the breakup of his marriage and is writing a children's book.
   ``Intellectually he is in good spirits,'' said <PERSON>Ali</PERSON>. ``He is not
cowed by the fundamentalists. ... Come what may, his book will haunt
the Islamic world forever.''

<HL> Volume Business: Waldenbooks Peddles Books a Bit Like Soap, Transforming Market --- Chief Officer Harry Hoffman Puts Emphasis on Profits; A Threat to Little Stores --- How to Create a Best Seller </HL>

<TEXT>
   Should books be sold like soap or toothpaste? 

   <PERSON>Harry Hoffman</PERSON> thinks they should. 
And that upsets a lot of people because <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON>, who learned to sell at <ORGANIZATION>Procter &amp; Gamble Co.</ORGANIZATION>, is now the most powerful man in American book publishing. 
The man who has profoundly and irrevocably changed the way books are created, marketed and bought in this country considers them a commodity whose success can be driven by packaging and promotion. 

   In nine years as the chief executive of Waldenbooks, <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON> has transformed the <ORGANIZATION>K mart Corp.</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary from a dull giant into the most innovative book retailer in the <LOCATION>U.S</LOCATION>. When he took over in <DATE>1979</DATE>, <LOCATION>Waldenbooks</LOCATION>, then part of <ORGANIZATION>Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, had 542 stores and sold 20 million books annually. 
This year, its 1,319 book outlets will sell some 100 million books. 

   That rapid growth has put Waldenbooks' sales neck and neck with closely held <ORGANIZATION>B. Dalton/Barnes &amp; Noble</ORGANIZATION>, which once had a comfortable lead. 
Since <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON> entered the game, Waldenbooks has gained a reputation for creativity and aggressiveness that <LOCATION>Dalton</LOCATION>, which has 795 stores, has lost. 
"Waldenbooks is more responsive to the marketplace and more willing to quickly change directions," says <PERSON>Allan Lang</PERSON>, who has been active in book sales and marketing for 25 years. 

   In <DATE>1987</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Waldenbooks</ORGANIZATION>' sales reached about <MONEY>$800 million</MONEY>, according to <ORGANIZATION>BP</ORGANIZATION> Report, an industry newsletter. 
<PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON> estimates that this year same-store sales will rise <PERCENT>11%</PERCENT> and overall volume <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT>. 
BP Report puts <ORGANIZATION>Dalton</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>1987</DATE> sales at <MONEY>$950 million</MONEY>, but if textbooks -- which Waldenbooks doesn't sell -- are excluded, <PERSON>Dalton</PERSON>'s sales would have matched or slightly trailed Waldenbooks'. 

   As Waldenbooks' sales grow, so does <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON>'s influence over the publishing industry. 
<PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON>, an aficionado of mysteries, thrillers and business books, credits himself with almost single-handedly putting on national best-seller lists <PERSON>Nelson DeMille</PERSON>'s "Charm School," a thriller favorably reviewed by the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON> tells publishers what he thinks of the design, timing and marketing of their books. 
He scans manuscripts sent to him by unknown authors seeking advice. 
He grants audiences to well-known writers, such as <PERSON>Harvey Mackay</PERSON>, the author of "Swim With the Sharks," who make pilgrimages to his <LOCATION>Stamford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, office. 

   In an industry that boasts of being the last bastion of civilized commerce, <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON> doesn't believe selling books is a gentleman's game. 
He is riveted on the bottom line. 
He squeezes out literary works to make room for blockbusters, and he squeezes out books in general to stock higher-margin items such as greeting cards and audiocassettes; <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> of Waldenbooks' sales aren't books. 
And he doesn't subscribe to the industry's conceit that it's all one big happy family. 
"I look on my competitors as the enemy," he says. 

   To members of the literary crowd that still dominates much of American publishing, <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON>'s growing power is unnerving. 
They sneer at him for including among the great authors of the <DATE>20th century</DATE> <PERSON>Tom Clancy</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jackie Collins</PERSON> and <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> L'Amour -- all better known for big sales. 
But <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON>, a brawny 60-year-old with a guileless manner, isn't embarrassed by his preference for the commercial over the literary. 
Let the publishing highbrows sell esoterica to cliques; <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON> believes he can push product where it has never been pushed before. 

   To independent booksellers, <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON> is a grim reaper constantly threatening to cut them down. 
When a Waldenbooks outlet opened recently in <LOCATION>Westport</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, a local bookstore manager quickly felt the impact. 

   "Sales have been dropping," says <PERSON>Erik Semmelmeyer</PERSON>, who manages the Remarkable Book Shop. 
"They can discount more freely, and we can't match them discount for discount because we're such a small operation. . . . 
They have enough stores to be able to take a loss on some of them while they wait out the competition." 

   Waldenbooks' growth feeds on itself, with publishers offering steeper discounts to chains than to independent stores. 
"The publishers say we need the chains to sell our best sellers, and we need the independents to provide customer service," says <PERSON>Andy Ross</PERSON>, who owns Cody's Books, an independent bookstore in <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. 
"Well, best sellers are where you make your money. 
No one has ever made money providing customer service." 

   Although Waldenbooks has never been more powerful, it is facing new challenges. 
Even <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON> concedes that the basic Waldenbooks outlet is a mature business. 
In the <DATE>1970s</DATE>, Waldenbooks capitalized on the proliferation of malls, which offered armies of foot traffic. 
But mall construction has slowed, and the leases that Waldenbooks signed 10 or 15 years ago are expiring, rents are rising sharply, and the stores can't easily expand to make room for higher-margin products. 

   As a result, <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON> has been pushing the company into new ventures. 
It is opening new chains: of upscale bookstores called <ORGANIZATION>Brentano</ORGANIZATION>'s, of book and gift stores called <ORGANIZATION>Waldenbooks &amp; More</ORGANIZATION>, of children's stores called Waldenkids, and of software stores called Waldensoftware. 
It recently entered the lucrative book-fair business and, to promote brand loyalty, has started five book clubs, which offer discounts in its stores to regular buyers. 
It also is testing a direct-mail business to compete with the big book clubs. 

   Waldenbooks stores are increasingly becoming places to buy entertainment rather than just books. 
Unlike most <LOCATION>Dalton</LOCATION> stores, which tend to be more sedate, <PERSON>Walden</PERSON> stores are a cluttered collection of cardboard display boxes, pyramids of best sellers, spinning racks of audiotapes and huge expanses of primarily mass-market paperbacks. 
Waldenbooks stores also devote more space to non-book items, such as tapes, calendars and posters. 

   But both chains aggressively promote the latest mass-market hard-cover best sellers, putting them in the front of each store or along the main thoroughfare, the "power aisle." 
Both carry only a limited selection of highbrow books. 

   Especially worrisome to publishers is Waldenbooks' decision to publish some of its own books. 
Four years ago, the company, under the name <ORGANIZATION>Longmeadow Press</ORGANIZATION>, published five "no-nonsense" financial guides. 
Today, <LOCATION>Longmeadow</LOCATION> publishes about 60 such guides on subjects ranging from health to real estate. 
This year, it will publish 36 children's titles in a venture with <PERSON>Jim Henson</PERSON> of Muppet fame, and it plans at least 20 more titles next year. 
<LOCATION>Longmeadow</LOCATION> publishes more than 25 calendars a year. 
And, in conjunction with <ORGANIZATION>Crown Publishing Group</ORGANIZATION>, which is now part of <ORGANIZATION>S.I. Newhouse Jr.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Longmeadow</LOCATION> recently launched the Pageant series -- some 12 paperback titles a month in such categories as romance, mystery and science fiction. 

   "Within the next two or three years, we'll be one of the top 10 publishers in the country," <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON> predicts. 

   Waldenbooks stores display <LOCATION>Longmeadow</LOCATION>'s books lavishly and keep Pageant books on their shelves more than twice as long as other paperbacks. 
"We've given Pageant more space because we're trying to prove some points, to show that you can create a publishing line by promoting it properly," <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON> says. 
"We're trying to set an example for the industry." 

   <LOCATION>Longmeadow</LOCATION>'s books are available to any bookseller, but the idea that one retailer could completely control distribution of a book frightens many in the industry. 
Last year, when <PERSON>Allen Neuharth</PERSON>, the chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Gannett Co.</ORGANIZATION>, wrote a book called "BusCapade," Waldenbooks received the exclusive right to sell it for a few months. 
Because of protests from independent booksellers, "BusCapade" was made available to other retailers through two wholesalers. 
It sold poorly, but the industry was duly warned. 

   Although publishers appreciate the enormous boost that Waldenbooks can give a book simply with good display and marketing, they are dismayed by the way the chain can blight a book's prospects. 
<PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON> acknowledges that Waldenbooks' buyers, who are so young that one senior executive calls them "the kids," are as interested in a book's numbers as in its literary merit. 
"I know it's blasphemy," <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON> says, "but they should find out what the print run is, what they're going to do with advertising and a few other things -- who the author is -- and then they can pretty well make a decision." 
A big print run is viewed as a crucial indicator that the publisher expects big sales. 

   Similarly, even if a book qualifies by such standards for Waldenbooks' shelves, its longevity is determined by a computer. 
Until recently, individual store managers had some control over books' shelf life in their stores. 
Now, every month, they get lists of books to be returned. 
"We're saying when the returns list goes out, I don't care how many of those books you're selling every week, you've got to send them back," <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON> says. 
"Because the overall trend for that book is down, and rarely does a book come back." 

   As <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON> has accumulated power, he has increased the pressure on publishers to offer him better deals. 
He constantly seeks ways to push publishers to share costs with him, and he says he is trying to train his buyers to "make sure terms are adequate." 
Although he says he would never reject a book because of the terms, he notes that in an industry producing some 45,000 new products a year, a certain amount of triage is inevitable. 
"Here's one book on Mediterranean cooking, and here's another book on Mediterranean cooking," he says hypothetically. 
"They're pretty equal. 
So, we'll try to do the one that can give us something." 

   Publishers have little choice but to respond to his wishes -- and, for the record, they praise his marketing genius. 
In the small pond of publishing, he is a big fish. 
"Nobody wants to aggravate <PERSON>Harry Hoffman</PERSON>," one publishing executive says. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON> is aware that his position has earned him a certain immunity from criticism, and he doesn't mind one bit. 
"I find that whenever someone has something negative to say about this company, it's usually <PERSON>David Godine</PERSON>, whom we don't do any business with, or someone who's small or insignificant to us," he says. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Godine</PERSON>, who says his <ORGANIZATION>David R. Godine Publisher Inc.</ORGANIZATION> does limited business with Waldenbooks, is among the few publishers who have publicly criticized Waldenbooks. 
"I think they cater to mediocrity," <PERSON>Mr. Godine</PERSON> says. 
"When a company makes book selections based on ad budget and printing size, they're cutting off the main responsibility of people in publishing, which is to find and nurture new talent. 
Waldenbooks says, 'We'll only take the tried and true.' 
It's one massive, monolithic mind." 
The Godine company publishes both fiction and nonfiction books and has sales of about <MONEY>$3 million</MONEY> a year. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON> vehemently denies not caring about developing new authors and he argues that blockbuster writers benefit everyone in the book business. 
"More and more of our business is becoming a fashion business," he says. 
"When {<PERSON>Tom</PERSON>} <PERSON>Clancy</PERSON> writes a book, our total business just takes off. 
We sell an awful lot of <PERSON>Clancy</PERSON>, but all our categories get a terrific lift. 
If we could find a Clancy 12 times a year, our business would be exceptional." 

   With <PERSON>G.P. Putnam</PERSON>'s Sons, <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON> is trying to turn a relatively unknown mystery writer named <PERSON>Bernard Cornwell</PERSON>, whose book "Wildtrack" was published in <DATE>July</DATE>, into a brand-name author. 
He acted after <PERSON>Putnam</PERSON>'s president, <PERSON>Phyllis Grann</PERSON>, sent him an early copy; he read it and liked it. 

   To stimulate sales of "Wildtrack" and <PERSON>Mr. DeMille</PERSON>'s "Charm School," <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON> put them into a special incentive program, in which each copy that his stores sold would add a dollar to a pool that would later be split among their staffs. 
Such books also are in the "hot new release" program, which ensures prominent placement in the stores. 

   But <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON> found the cover of "Charm School" bland -- it had a simple picture of a soldier and the title -- and he urged the publisher, the <ORGANIZATION>Warner Books</ORGANIZATION> unit of <ORGANIZATION>Warner Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, to change it. 
Although <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> stuck with the original cover in the hardback edition, the paperback cover conveys a much stronger feeling of a thriller about Soviet espionage; it shows dog tags emblazoned with a hammer and sickle and includes some blurbs calling it "chilling, compelling . . . 
Cold War fiction." 
<PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON> recently received a copy of the paperback cover with a note from <PERSON>Laurence Kirshbaum</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Warner Books</ORGANIZATION>' president, saying, "As you can see, we took your advice on the cover." 

   Despite all the efforts to sell "Charm School," <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON> concedes that so far Waldenbooks' hard-cover sales of the book have totaled only 9,000. (<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> won't disclose overall sales but says it printed just under 100,000 hard-cover copies and plans 1.2 million in paperback.) 
"I'm not deflated," <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON> says, "because I think we can still help in the breakout process, but not as easily as I thought." 

   Despite occasional setbacks, <LOCATION>Waldenbooks</LOCATION>, together with <PERSON>Dalton</PERSON>, has shown the power of the chains in getting people to buy books. 
Before <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON> entered the business a decade ago, a hard-cover fiction best seller sold 150,000 copies. 
Today, such a book may sell as many as a million. 
And if it is a pulpy romance rather than a literary work, that suits <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON> and his supporters just fine. 
"Some publishers are always going to want to go back to the <PERSON>Bennett Cerf</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alfred Knopf</PERSON> era," <PERSON>Mr. Kirshbaum</PERSON> says. 
"But this is the mass-merchandising era. 
Books are a tough sell, and anyone who makes it easier has my complete approval." 

   As long as <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON> heads Waldenbooks -- and he intends to stay until forced to retire -- he clearly will try to increase its presence in the book business. 

   "We've done a lot of innovative things that I don't think people really give us credit for, or they do it begrudgingly," he says. 
"I think people think wrongly about us that we're overbearing. 
My philosophy has always been that any time we do anything of major consequence, we try to share the cost and benefit with publishers. 
But I don't think it's an overbearing, demanding-type situation."

   The numbers are in, and whatever else you might want to say about it, <DATE>1986</DATE> was a very good year for hardback books. 
According to figures just published in Publishers Weekly, the book trade's bible, by the end of <DATE>last year 15</DATE> titles racked up in-print figures of 500,000 or more. 

   At the top of the heap was "Fatherhood" (Doubleday) by <PERSON>Bill Cosby</PERSON>, which became the fastest-selling nonfiction hardcover, with two million-plus in print since its <DATE>May 1986</DATE> debut. 
The only other book to reach that magical mark was "Fit for Life" (<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>) by <PERSON>Harvey</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Marilyn Diamond</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Five books weighed in with one million copies or more in print: <PERSON>James Clavell</PERSON>'s "Whirlwind" (<PERSON>Morrow</PERSON>), <PERSON>Martin Katahn</PERSON>'s "The Rotation Diet" (<PERSON>Norton</PERSON>), <PERSON>Kitty Kelley</PERSON>'s "His Way" (Bantam), <PERSON>Stephen King</PERSON>'s "It" (Viking) and <PERSON>Tom Clancy</PERSON>'s "Red Storm Rising" (Putnam).

Real-Estate Tycoon Begins
Media Blitz to Sell Book;
The Party in the Atrium

<DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Real-estate tycoon <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON> loves to think big. 
And in the case of his new book, maybe a bit too big. 
Just listen: 

   "The book has gone out in an unusual number of copies," he says. 
"Two hundred thousand." 
Well, not exactly. 
In fact, 150,000 have been printed. 

   "Today" will feature him in "five segments," he says. 
Well, not quite. 
The <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> show plans only two. 

   A recent <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> magazine cover story that excerpted his book was "the biggest seller they ever had," he says. 
Maybe or maybe not. 
The magazine doesn't get its sales figures back for at least 60 days. 

   If <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> has been caught playing a bit loose with the facts, he probably won't mind. 
"A little hyperbole never hurts," he says in his book. 
"I call it truthful hyperbole. 
It's an innocent form of exaggeration -- and a very effective form of promotion." 

   All hype aside, <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Random House Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, his publisher, have big plans for "Trump: The Art of the Deal." 
The book, in which <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> shares the secrets of his success for <MONEY>$19.95</MONEY> a copy, has already hit <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> bookstores, and it is now making its debut nationwide. 

   "If a person has an instinct for making deals, they'll make a fortune by reading this book," promises <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON>. 

   Prepare yourself for more Trumpisms. 
In the next few weeks, the book will get one of the most extraordinary publicity blitzes ever for a new book. 
Wake up to <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> on "Today," watch him later in the day ("Donahue") or at night (with <PERSON>Barbara Walters</PERSON> on "20/20"), or nod off to the sound of his voice on "Late Night With <PERSON>David Letterman</PERSON>." 
If you miss those appearances, your local television station may be one of 12 scheduled for live satellite interviews. 

   You can also catch up with <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> at the supermarket in People magazine or read the <LOCATION>Philadelphia Inquirer</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Tribune</ORGANIZATION> or the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post. 
If all else fails, visit one of <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION> casinos or <ORGANIZATION>Trump Tower</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>. 
Chances are he will be there in person autographing books. 

   "<PERSON>Donald</PERSON>'s ambition is to outsell <LOCATION>Lee Iacocca</LOCATION>. 
That's what this is all about," says "60 Minutes" correspondent <PERSON>Mike Wallace</PERSON>, who wrote a glowing blurb for the book ("This reads like Trump unvarnished -- vainglorious, combative, ambitious and unafraid to let us know about it!"). 

   <PERSON>Mr. Wallace</PERSON> doesn't think <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON>'s book will actually outsell "Iacocca," and <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> isn't saying that it's that ambitious. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp.</ORGANIZATION> chairman sold 2.6 million copies in hard cover alone. 
But <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> has a lot at stake here: its reputation for picking winners and the <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> advance it gave <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON>. (The developer says he is giving all proceeds to charity.) 

   <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> initially agreed to write an autobiography two years ago at the request of <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> owner <ORGANIZATION>S.I. Newhouse Jr</ORGANIZATION>. 
Several months later, writer <PERSON>Tony Schwartz</PERSON>, interviewing <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> for a Playboy magazine article, suggested that the developer might be too young at 39 to be writing his memoirs. 
Besides, <PERSON>Mr. Schwartz</PERSON> said, people might be more interested in <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON>'s deal-making prowess. 
<PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> agreed, signed on <PERSON>Mr. Schwartz</PERSON> as co-writer, and the rest is history. 

   Following <PERSON>Mr. Schwartz</PERSON>'s suggestion, the book is short on personal details. 
It notes that <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> was born into a wealthy real-estate family in the borough of <LOCATION>Queens</LOCATION>, left college with a mere <MONEY>$200,000</MONEY>, and married <LOCATION>Ivana</LOCATION>, a former skiing star and fashion model. 
But the focus of "Trump" is deal-making, specifically <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON>'s unfailing ability to swing real-estate deals despite the opposition of such foes as <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>Edward Koch</PERSON>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON>'s renown in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> seems sure to sell the book here; the president of <ORGANIZATION>Doubleday Book Shops</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Gary DelVecchio</PERSON>, says that the book has sold "phenomenally" at its store across from <ORGANIZATION>Trump Tower</ORGANIZATION>. 

   "Today, business tycoons are cult heroes with the masses -- they live vicariously with the yachts and the helicopters," says <PERSON>Leonard Riggio</PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION>Barnes &amp; Noble Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which also owns the national <ORGANIZATION>B. Dalton Booksellers</ORGANIZATION> chain. 
"<PERSON>Trump</PERSON> has a world-class ego and a world-class appetite -- let's hope he has a world-class audience." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> is certain his growing national reputation will help sell books. 
In the past year he has appeared on the covers of Fortune, <ORGANIZATION>Business Week</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Newsweek</ORGANIZATION>; the recent <ORGANIZATION>Newsweek</ORGANIZATION> cover was the magazine's seventh-best seller this year. ("It should be; he bought 10,000 copies himself," says a <ORGANIZATION>Newsweek</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman.) 
As a result of such exposure, <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> says, "this book looks like it will be just as big in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> as it is in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>." 

   But some booksellers aren't so sure. 
"I don't think it will be a big book in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>," says <PERSON>Harlan Smith</PERSON>, a buyer for the 17-store <ORGANIZATION>Kroch's &amp; Brentano</ORGANIZATION>'s chain in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Smith</PERSON> thinks that <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON>'s highfalutin style may not go over well in the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>. 
"We like things a little more basic -- not as glitzy," he says. 

   <PERSON>Rhett Jackson</PERSON>, the proprietor of the Happy Bookseller in <LOCATION>Columbia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, and the president of the <ORGANIZATION>American Booksellers Association</ORGANIZATION>, couldn't quite recall the Trump book at first. 
"What's the name of it?" he asks. 
His chief book buyer informs him that the store bought 10 copies instead of the 20 pressed on it by its <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> salesperson. 
"Business books have taken a pretty sharp dive in the last 18 months," says <PERSON>Mr. Jackson</PERSON>. 
"And we're not sure how well known he is in these parts." 

   "We don't think it's going to sell anything like it will in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>," says <PERSON>David Sisk</PERSON>, a buyer for the Bookstop chain in <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Sisk</PERSON> bought about 395 copies for his 13 Texas stores, compared with an initial order of 1,200 copies of <PERSON>T. Boone Pickens</PERSON>'s book last year. 
And while <PERSON>B. Dalton</PERSON>'s New York-based owners are enthusiastic about the book, a saleswoman at the chain's store in <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Century III Mall</ORGANIZATION> led a customer to a back shelf and said, "People aren't that interested in <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON> around here. 
We don't think this will sell too well in this part of the country." 

   But <PERSON>Susan Russenberger</PERSON>, who buys books for <ORGANIZATION>Ingram Book Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a wholesaler that serves chain and independent stores, is more optimistic. 
"When <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> prints 150,000 copies of a book, that's something you can almost bank on," she says. 
She agreed to buy 15,000 copies for her customers in <DATE>June</DATE> after <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> told her that "<PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON> is very interested in selling this book and is going to exert a lot of energy into making a success." 

   She got that right. 
In between deal-making, giving speeches on nuclear disarmament, fighting with Mayor <PERSON>Koch</PERSON> and hinting that he may run for president, <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> has tirelessly campaigned to promote his book. 
In <DATE>May</DATE>, he spent part of his Memorial Day weekend at the <ORGANIZATION>American Booksellers</ORGANIZATION> convention in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. 

   Along with <PERSON>Mr. Newhouse</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> exhorted a group of book retailers and wholesalers to get out there and sell, sell, sell his book. 
<PERSON>Mr. Newhouse</PERSON>, who rarely attends such meetings and almost never speaks publicly, told the crowd that he had made two great decisions in publishing: buying <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> and signing <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> to write a book. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> didn't stop at that. 
He hopped up to <LOCATION>Stamford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, to have a meeting with regional managers of the Waldenbooks chain, the country's largest. 
He took some powerful book executives to lunch, including <PERSON>Mr. Riggio</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Barnes &amp; Noble</ORGANIZATION>. 
Over lunch at La Cote Basque in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, "he told me he'd really like to see the book do well," says <PERSON>Mr. Riggio</PERSON>. 
"He has a great instinct for promotion -- he gets in touch, tugs you by the collar and pats you on the back." 

   To promote the book in its <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> flagship store, <ORGANIZATION>Barnes &amp; Noble</ORGANIZATION> has created a "Trump Tower" display. 
It may even sell copies from pushcarts on <LOCATION>Fifth Avenue</LOCATION>. 
Waldenbooks has created a "power aisle" -- a display of signs and books -- in its stores. 
Its customer newsletter includes reservation coupons for the book, and the chain's business-gift catalog features "Trump" prominently in an ad for a toll-free gift-ordering service. 

   There will also be a book party, of course. 
<PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> has invited 3,000 of his closest friends for music and dancing in the atrium of <ORGANIZATION>Trump Tower</ORGANIZATION>. 
Two of his pals, <PERSON>Steven Rubell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ian Schrager</PERSON>, the founders of the disco Studio 54, are taking care of the details. 
"It will be the party of the year," <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> promises. 

   But <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s cognoscenti may have trouble staying awake. 
Trump Tower has <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON>'s name on it; the atrium, however, is considered a public place, and private parties that start before <TIME>10 p.m.</TIME> require city approval. 
As it happens, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> won't let <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> start his party early, and some believe that the decision came from Mayor <PERSON>Koch</PERSON> himself. 
New York newspapers recently quoted <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> describing the mayor as "a moron" during a public dispute over the developer's proposed Television City project. 
A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Hizzoner</ORGANIZATION> will say only that "the mayor says he's not talking about <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON> anymore."

   When publisher <PERSON>Jorge de Herralde</PERSON> saw
novels bearing his Anagrama Logo in all three bookstores on
<LOCATION>Lanzarote Island</LOCATION>, he knew things were looking up for serious books
in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>.
   ``Eight or nine years ago, it would have been impossible to find
good novels and essays in bookstores in provincial towns, let alone
on a small island in the Canaries,'' he said. ``It makes me
optimistic about the future of Spanish publishing.''
   <PERSON>Silvia Lluis</PERSON>, director of the year-old publishing company <ORGANIZATION>Circe
Ediciones</ORGANIZATION>, agrees that now is the time for quality books in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>.
   ``There's a new, discriminating reading public that wants more
than the pulp best sellers,'' she said. ``They've read <PERSON>Marguerite
Yourcenar</PERSON>, and they don't want to settle for less.''
   The increased interest in quality books in a country where
newspaper readership is the lowest in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> comes more than a
decade after the demise of Gen. <PERSON>Francisco Franco</PERSON>'s dictatorship and
his 36 years of cultural and intellectual repression.
   The change has been fairly sudden. It is due in part to <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>'s
<DATE>1986</DATE> entry into the European Common Market which has broadened many
horizons. De Herralde also credited the newfound market to a
decline in ideological topics and obscure experimental writing by
some authors, and a return to the narrative _ both in Spanish and
foreign literature.
   Those in the publishing industry, centered mainly in this
northeastern port city, say Spaniards are now looking beyond their
borders, learning foreign languages and reading good books.
   A <DATE>1985</DATE> study initiated by the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Culture</ORGANIZATION> on Spanish
cultural behavior said that although <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of Spanish
households possessed books, mainly encyclopedias or technical
manuals, only <PERCENT>41 percent</PERCENT> read any of them.
   The study also showed that the Spanish reading public is heavily
concentrated in <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> and in <LOCATION>Catalonia</LOCATION>, of which <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION> is the
capital _ the the most developed and educated regions of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>. The
illiteracy rate is <PERCENT>7.4 percent</PERCENT> in a population of 36.8 million,
third highest in the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION>European Economic Community</ORGANIZATION> after
<LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>. Results also revealed that fewer than <PERCENT>11
percent</PERCENT> of Spaniards ever set foot inside a library.
   ``Many people are still afraid to go inside bookstores or
libraries because they think they're only for intellectuals,'' said
<PERSON>Manuel Ripoll</PERSON>, producer of ``Entrelineas'' (``Between the Lines''),
Spanish state TV's new literary program. ``That's why so many of
the books sold in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> are purchased at corner newsstands.''
   De Herralde pointed out that the biggest single bookseller in
<LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> _ with items ranging from how-to manuals to poetry
collections _ is <ORGANIZATION>El Corte Ingles</ORGANIZATION>, the country's only department
store chain.
   Translations of foreign works _ primarily American and English
books _ make up about <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of the lists of <LOCATION>Anagrama</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Circe</ORGANIZATION>
and other quality houses. The other <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> is devoted to the
works of established or new Spanish authors.
   Five years ago de <ORGANIZATION>Herralde</ORGANIZATION>, a 52-year-old former industrial
engineer, took a chance on <PERSON>John Kennedy Toole</PERSON>'s ``A Confederacy of
Dunces,'' a cult novel published in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> when the
unknown author's mother brought the manuscript to a publisher after
his suicide. The book earned the author a posthumous Pulitzer Prize
in <DATE>1981</DATE>.
   The Spanish edition has gone into 22 printings and has sold
100,000 copies. The translation into Catalan, a language spoken by
more than 5 million people in the northeastern part of the country,
is due out in <DATE>April</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Pilar Raola</PERSON>, director of the Catalan publishing house Editorial
Portic, said many Spanish-reading Catalans preferred to wait to
read a translation of a foreign novel in their own language,
resulting in a similar upsurge in Catalan-language publishing.
   According to the <ORGANIZATION>Spanish Association of Book Publishers</ORGANIZATION>, 38,814
titles were published in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> in <DATE>1986</DATE> of which 7,483 were novels
and essays. The average press run for a Spanish novel is between
3,500 and 4,000 copies.
   Felix de <LOCATION>Azua</LOCATION>'s ``Diary of a Humiliated Man'' has gone into its
third printing at <LOCATION>Anagrama</LOCATION> in three months following its
publication in <DATE>December</DATE> after winning the firm's coveted Herralde
literary award.
   Chilean author <PERSON>Isabel Allende</PERSON>'s ``<PERSON>Eva Luna</PERSON>'' and ``Belle du
Seigneur'' by French author <PERSON>Albert Cohen</PERSON> have been jockeying for
first place on the best-seller list of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>'s leading newspaper <LOCATION>El
Pais</LOCATION> for the past six months. Five of the 10 top-selling books on
the list are by Spanish authors.
   The most successful Spanish novel this century is <PERSON>Jose Maria
Gironella</PERSON>'s ``Cypresses Believe in God,'' set in the years leading
up to the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War. Since its publication in the
late <DATE>1950s</DATE>, the book has sold over 4 million copies.
   The burst of interest in quality fiction has led Spanish
publishing giants to set up smaller collections devoted to serious
fiction and essays, de <PERSON>Herralde</PERSON> said.
   And the nationwide Readers' Circle book club began including
quality foreign and domestic fiction several years ago at the
request of its 1.3 million members, according to spokesman <PERSON>Hans
Gentz</PERSON>.

   For <PERSON>Verlyn Klinkenborg</PERSON> it was a dream come true. 
The <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> raved about his first book, "Making Hay," a 160-page paean to family farming in the American heartland. 
It was the kind of review that sends people flocking to bookstores. 
But in this case, few would-be readers could find it. 

   "Making Hay" was published by <PERSON>Nick Lyons</PERSON> Books in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, the type of small specialty publishing house that is all but ignored by the nation's big retail book chains. 
But <PERSON>Nick Lyons</PERSON>, the company's founder and president, has a knack for finding other outlets for his books. 

   Take the <ORGANIZATION>NAPA Auto Store</ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION>Rock Rapids</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>. 
Why an auto-parts store stocks a stack of books on hay farming is easily explained. 
"<PERSON>Verlyn</PERSON> is a nephew of mine, of course," says the store's owner, <PERSON>Kenneth K. Klinkenborg</PERSON>. 
To give folks in Rock Rapids an opportunity to buy the book, <PERSON>Mr. Klinkenborg</PERSON> used to drive 32 miles to <LOCATION>Sioux Falls</LOCATION> in his pickup truck to buy copies, paying the full <MONEY>$14.95</MONEY> retail price. 
It didn't bother him that he didn't make a cent reselling them to his customers. 
"I'm just trying to get as many books sold as I can," he explains. 

   When <PERSON>Mr. Lyons</PERSON> got wind of this, he offered to sell <PERSON>Mr. Klinkenborg</PERSON> copies at <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> off the cover price, even if he ordered only six books. 
The arrangement pleases the author's uncle, who says, "We sold about 10 or 15 already, and they let me make a little money, too." 

   So it goes in the backwaters of book publishing, where 15,000 small publishers stay afloat, or even turn a comfortable profit, by catering to quirky or limited interests and doggedly pursuing every last sale. 
They operate with a gritty resourcefulness unheard of -- and unnecessary -- at the 300 or so big trade-book publishing houses that produce roughly <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT> of the 50,000 new titles appearing each year. 

   "The most serious problem for a small publisher is persuading the chains to open an account," <PERSON>Mr. Lyons</PERSON> says. 
But chain stores have little incentive to buy 50 or 100 copies of a single title from outfits such as his. 
<PERSON>John Dessauer</PERSON>, the director of the <ORGANIZATION>Center for Book Research</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Scranton</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, explains: "The cost of opening an account for one title is going to be more than any profit from the book." 

   Yet small publishers provide a rich variety, printing books on odd subjects, giving unknown authors a voice and resurrecting out-of-print titles. 
<ORGANIZATION>Howell Book House Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> has been successfully publishing books about dogs for 26 years. 
Its mainstay is a line of 60 books, each devoted to a different breed. 
"We are the Tiffany of dog publishing," says <PERSON>Sean Frawley</PERSON>, the president. 

   Occasionally, a tiny publisher hits pay dirt. 
Ten Speed Press in <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, published "What Color is Your Parachute?" in <DATE>1972</DATE>. 
The career-planning book became a runaway best seller a few years later and still sells briskly. 

   <PERSON>Nick Lyons</PERSON> Books hasn't yet produced a blockbuster. 
But then, most of the roughly 20 new titles it brings out each year concern fishing or the outdoors-books that, <PERSON>Mr. Lyons</PERSON> concedes, "few others are interested in publishing." 

   The people who publish <PERSON>Sidney Sheldon</PERSON> or <PERSON>Judith Krantz</PERSON> aren't gnawing their knuckles because <PERSON>Mr. Lyons</PERSON> beat them to "Angling Entomology: A Primer for Fly Fishermen." 
But <PERSON>Mr. Lyons</PERSON> has been successfully publishing such fare for more than 20 years, first for other publishers and, for the past four years, as head of his company. 
Though revenue was a meager <MONEY>$447,000</MONEY> for the year ended last <DATE>March 31</DATE> and is headed toward <MONEY>$800,000</MONEY> in the current fiscal year, his company hasn't run in the red or needed to borrow. 

   For <PERSON>Mr. Lyons</PERSON> fishing is more than a publishing specialty, more than a pastime he writes about gracefully in a column in Fly Fisherman magazine. 
When it comes to fishing, he says, "I am a lunatic." 

   The <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY> seed capital to start his company came from seven well-heeled fishing cronies who are minority stockholders. 
<PERSON>Mr. Lyons</PERSON> owns <PERCENT>51%</PERCENT> of the stock; active partner <PERSON>Peter Burford</PERSON>, 31, who joined him after a stint at <ORGANIZATION>Crown Publishers Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, also holds an interest. 

   Publishing so-called backlist books that are kept in print for years on end has some advantages over publishing best sellers. 
A good fishing book will never match a <PERSON>Jackie Collins</PERSON> novel in total sales. 
But it will outlive her racy fiction, with its fickle readers. 
Publishers will dump most of this year's best sellers on "remainder" tables next year, where they may fetch as little as <MONEY>$1</MONEY> apiece. 

   <PERSON>Nick Lyons</PERSON> doesn't put any of his titles on the remainder heap because most just keep on selling. 
A number of <PERSON>Nick Lyons</PERSON> books have sales increases each year "without any work on our part," he says. 
He adds, "It's like having an annuity, and each year's new titles are added to the income stream. 

   Occasional clinkers do creep in. 
A <MONEY>$5.95</MONEY> paperback parody of university literary reviews has sold a paltry 250 copies since <DATE>1984</DATE>, leaving 3,250 unsold and about <MONEY>$3,500</MONEY> in unrecovered costs. 
"This isn't the kind of mistake we could afford to make every day," says <PERSON>Mr. Burford</PERSON>, who is responsible for production. 

   Small publishers can turn a profit selling as few as 1,000 copies of a book. 
They operate with a frugality unknown at big publishing houses, whose annual lunch tabs could keep a small firm going for a year. 
The printing and promotional budget for all 16 new books in the <PERSON>Nick Lyons</PERSON> spring catalog is only <MONEY>$65,000</MONEY>. 
A big house spends that for one book deemed to have modest sales potential, and spends millions more for a blockbuster. 

   A typical author's advance from <PERSON>Nick Lyons</PERSON> Books is <MONEY>$1,500</MONEY>, a sum that "would embarrass a big house," <PERSON>Mr. Lyons</PERSON> says. 
But it means the writer is eligible for royalties that much sooner. 
"Our authors earn money as their books earn money," he says. 

   <PERSON>Mark Sosin</PERSON>, the author of more than a dozen fishing books, says that although he has received heftier advances for books published by big houses, they didn't sell as well as those published by <PERSON>Nick Lyons</PERSON>. 
"Anybody can publish," <PERSON>Mr. Sosin</PERSON> says. 
"Marketing is another story. 
Nick has come up with some unusual marketing ideas." 

   The <ORGANIZATION>University of Scranton</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Dessauer</PERSON>, a veteran industry observer, agrees. 
"The trade-book publishers don't know what to do with specialized books," he says. 
"Often they only market to the bookstores, and if the stores don't buy a book, the hell with it." 

   It is not in <PERSON>Nick Lyons</PERSON>'s nature to shrug off sales. 
Twenty years ago, while working at <ORGANIZATION>Crown Publishers</ORGANIZATION>, he realized that bookstores weren't the best outlets for fishing books. 
As a result, <PERCENT>95%</PERCENT> of the books bearing his logo (a trout leaping over the firm's initials) are sold elsewhere: in fishing-tackle stores, mail-order catalogs, and, of course, that auto-parts store. 
The "L.L. 
Bean Fly Fishing Handbook," which has sold some 30,000 copies and is in its 12th printing, is his best-selling title. 

   "We try to use common sense," <PERSON>Mr. Lyons</PERSON> says. 
"We ask ourselves who will be interested in these books." 
For "Grizzly Country," it was readers of Bear News, a publication of the <ORGANIZATION>Great Bear Foundation</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Missoula</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mont</LOCATION>. 
The foundation used an excerpt of the book in its newsletter, which has 3,000 subscribers. 
Later, <PERSON>Mr. Lyons</PERSON> arranged for the foundation to buy the book at wholesale to resell to its members. 
<PERSON>Lance Olsen</PERSON>, the foundation's president, says: "It sells good. 
It's a classic." 

   At times, <PERSON>Mr. Lyons</PERSON> departs from formula, as when he published actress <PERSON>Rita Gam</PERSON>'s memoir, "Actress to Actress," last <DATE>fall</DATE>. 
The manuscript, rejected by other publishers, found its way to him at a time when he was seeking something different. 
"I think you can do too many fishing books," he says. 

   Miss Gam made the rounds of the talk shows, including the "Today Show," to plug the book. 
And it became the first <PERSON>Nick Lyons</PERSON> book to be carried by the <PERSON>B. Dalton</PERSON> chain. 
It has sold more than 3,000 copies, is in its second printing and has made money for both publisher and author. 

   Miss Gam is happy. 
Of <PERSON>Nick Lyons Books</PERSON>, she says: "They did anything a larger publishing house could do for me." 
The book, she adds, led to her first movie role in years, in the upcoming thriller "Twisted," starring <PERSON>Sally Kellerman</PERSON>. 

   But with hindsight, <PERSON>Mr. Lyons</PERSON> thinks the book was too far afield for his company. 
"We don't have the flash to do justice to this kind of book," he says. 
"And we don't want to have the flash."

   Literary World Is Debating How Much
   Of a Huckster a Book Writer Should Be

   In between camcorders, ruby rings and facial-hair
removers, several cable television shopping channels have
started selling a novel product: books.
   Viewers can call a toll-free number to buy a copy while
the author and a host sit in a studio extolling the book's
virtues: "great photos;" "easy reading;" "get your own
autographed copy." Best-selling novelist Rosamunde Pilcher
pitched her latest book on QVC, and Arthur Hailey and Bob
Hope have appeared on J.C. Penney's Television Shopping
Channel. QVC says it sells 100 to 150 books a minute.

<TEXT>
   Faced with the hard economics of publishing, many writers
have become more aggressive and creative about promoting
their books and themselves. <PERSON>Joan Didion</PERSON> modeled a turtleneck
in an ad for the Gap clothing stores. <PERSON>Leslie Walker</PERSON>, a
<LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> reporter, traveled the talk show circuit with the
brother of a murderer she portrayed in her book -- until the
brother was jailed for murder. <PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON> took journalists
on fishing trips to promote "An Outdoor Journal" several
years ago -- and he's a former president.
   But there's debate in the book world about how much of a
huckster a writer should be. The latest author to kindle the
controversy is <PERSON>Ken Follett</PERSON>. To increase sales of "Pillars of
the Earth," his latest novel in paperback, he agreed to be
part of the prize in a contest advertised in thousands of
bookstores. "Pillars" is about the building of a medieval
cathedral, and the winner of the contest will get a free trip
to <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and a tour of <ORGANIZATION>Westminster Abbey</ORGANIZATION> guided by the
author.
   And that's not all. At his publisher's request, <PERSON>Mr.
Follett</PERSON> wrote a romantic short story, "The Abiding Heart,"
that takes place in the present but uses the same medieval
cathedral as a backdrop. Good Housekeeping magazine got the
story free for its current issue. In return, <PERSON>Mr. Follett</PERSON>'s
publisher, a division of <ORGANIZATION>Penguin USA</ORGANIZATION>, received two full pages
advertising the "Pillars" contest just before the story.
   Some people in the book world are bothered by the <PERSON>Follett</PERSON>
magazine story because it was specifically written to garner
space -- and attention -- for an ad.
   "I think it's disgraceful," says <PERSON>James Michener</PERSON>, the
83-year-old author of 37 books. But <PERSON>Tama Janowitz</PERSON>, who
promoted her novel "Slaves of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>" with a video of
herself at parties with <PERSON>Andy Warhol</PERSON>, says, "You do what you
have to . . . and as long as someone is moved to read your
book, it's worthwhile."
   "I'd be crazy to turn down the chance to reach 20 million
Americans {Good <ORGANIZATION>Housekeeping</ORGANIZATION>'s readership} at one sweep,"
says <PERSON>Mr. Follett</PERSON>. So zealously does the author groom his
public image that he says he once took a course to learn to
apply his own make-up for television, and went to a "color
analyst" so "I would wear colors that make me look
attractive."
   Until recently, few authors would have admitted to such
concerns. "Ten years ago it was considered a bit tacky for a
serious writer to even go on a talk show," says <PERSON>Roger Straus
III</PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION>Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux</ORGANIZATION>. "The late
<PERSON>Walker Percy</PERSON> refused to go on <PERSON>Dick Cavett</PERSON> no matter how much
<PERSON>Cavett</PERSON> begged, and that was considered the best show for
selling books. <PERSON>Percy</PERSON> said his job was writing books, not
selling them."
   Some writers still feel that way, including <PERSON>John Hersey</PERSON>
and <PERSON>Anne Tyler</PERSON>, but the number is dwindling. Even <PERSON>John Updike</PERSON>
will talk about his books on <ORGANIZATION>National Public Radio</ORGANIZATION> or the
network morning shows, and for his last book, "The <ORGANIZATION>Russia
House</ORGANIZATION>," <PERSON>John le Carre</PERSON> agreed to spend a week in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>
doing interviews.
   "There is no longer a stigma attached to doing this," says
<PERSON>Laurence Kirshbaum</PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner Inc.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> Books.
"{Writers} know if they want the bucks, want the books to
sell, they better roll up their sleeves and turn off the word
processor and get out there and sell."
   Self-promotion by authors isn't entirely new. <PERSON>Mark Twain</PERSON>
was a notorious ham on the lecture circuit, and <PERSON>Charles
Dickens</PERSON> performed paid readings by the hundreds.
Book-promoting was taken to the heights of hype and crassness
in the <DATE>1970s</DATE> by such legendary hustlers as <PERSON>Jacqueline Susann</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Ms. Susann</PERSON> wooed bookstore owners and wholesalers with
personal notes and visits. To get on television, she would
even do game shows. <PERSON>Barbara Cartland</PERSON> pitched not only her
romance novels but also her own line of bedsheets, greeting
cards, perfume and vitamins, and she recorded an album of
love songs.
   Until recently, it seemed that writers were divided into
roughly two camps: It was all right for writers of trashy
novels to promote aggressively, but serious authors didn't
dirty their hands. Now, the distinctions are breaking down.
   More than 50,000 books are published a year, and most
disappear fast, selling fewer than 5,000 copies. In the past
decade, many publishing houses have been bought by big
conglomerates that chase surefire best-seller writers with
huge advances. The payments may not "earn out" unless the
author's name can be burned into the public's consciousness.
   "One of the wonderful, sad and desperate things about this
business is that nobody really knows how to sell books," says
<PERSON>Mr. Straus</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux</ORGANIZATION>, whose authors include
<PERSON>Scott Turow</PERSON>. "Especially as the stakes have gotten higher, we
are all thrashing around looking for some way to sell these
books."
   Advertising helps, but the usual marketing budget of
<MONEY>$15,000</MONEY> -- or even, say, <MONEY>$200,000</MONEY> for an expected bestseller
-- won't buy much of it. Author tours are one answer, and
more are being organized than ever. Even most literary
authors make the rounds of a dozen or so well-known
independent bookstores.
   "There are so many writers out there that if you have a
chance to flog your book, you can't say no," says <PERSON>Mark
Childress</PERSON>, who is embarking on a 22-city tour this <DATE>fall</DATE> for
"Tender," his new novel. "My first two books got wonderful
reviews, but hardly anybody bought them. I spent two years in
a room writing this book, and three weeks on the road isn't a
big investment of my time. I want to make this a living, not
a hobby."
   Getting exposure, even for a best-selling author like <PERSON>Mr.
Follett</PERSON>, requires a strategy. <PERSON>Mr. Follett</PERSON>'s paperback
publisher, <ORGANIZATION>New American Library</ORGANIZATION>, knew that no magazine would
make a big fuss excerpting part of "Pillars" because it had
already appeared in hardcover. But once the publisher began
talking to Good Housekeeping about doing a contest, and how
to promote it, the magazine's editors agreed to run a short
story by <PERSON>Mr. Follett</PERSON> if the magazine could have it
exclusively.
   It's too early to say what effect the story and contest
will have on sales, but "Pillars" jumped onto the <ORGANIZATION>New York
Times</ORGANIZATION> paperback best-seller list at fourth place about when
it landed in bookstores.
   This wasn't the first offbeat book promotion by the
41-year-old British ex-journalist. To introduce a pen several
years ago, <ORGANIZATION>Bic</ORGANIZATION> ran ads picturing <PERSON>Mr. Follett</PERSON>'s latest novel,
"Lie Down With Lions." Next to his signature, the copy read,
"The Bic Metal Point Roller is so exciting and stimulating I
couldn't put it down." In turn, his paperback publisher
shrink-wrapped thousands of free pens to copies of the book.
   <PERSON>Mr. Follett</PERSON>'s special willingness to hustle may have been
one factor in the recent feverish auction for his future
books. "One of the key factors in buying <PERSON>Ken</PERSON>'s books is that
he's an aggressive promoter," concurs <PERSON>Carole Baron</PERSON>, publisher
of the <ORGANIZATION>Dell</ORGANIZATION> division of <ORGANIZATION>Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing
Group</ORGANIZATION>, which has agreed to advance <PERSON>Mr. Follett</PERSON> <MONEY>$12.3 million</MONEY>
for two novels.
   As the pressure mounts, some authors are struggling to
figure out just where they should draw the line: What is
acceptable, honorable promotion, and what isn't?
   "It doesn't bother me that these young guys are getting a
flood of money," says <PERSON>Mr. Michener</PERSON>. "But I think they better
be very careful about the ethics of their profession. Society
gives writers leverage, and the ethical obligation is to use
that leverage creatively for the welfare of society and the
profession."
   <PERSON>Mr. Michener</PERSON> donates all his lecture fees to charity and
turned down "very substantial sums of money" to appear in a
wine commercial. But he recalls having to spend five years on
the lecture circuit early in his career, and he says he did
appear in a liquor ad years ago.
   "I do think there is an area of respectable promotion,"
says <PERSON>William Styron</PERSON>, but he says he wouldn't endorse a
product or appear on something like the cable shopping
channel, because "that becomes hucksterism."
   <PERSON>Mr. Styron</PERSON> says he was amazed recently at a request to use
a passage from his novel "Sophie's Choice" in a commercial
for <PERSON>Calvin Klein</PERSON>'s Obsession perfume. "They were talking a
lot of money, but I very emphatically decided not to," says
<PERSON>Mr. Styron</PERSON>. "For one thing, my daughter told me she would
never speak to me again if I did it."
   "I'm sure there are things I wouldn't do, like promoting
cigarettes," says <PERSON>Mr. Follett</PERSON>. "I understand there are
writers who are deeply, deeply serious about the creative
work they do and who feel promoting themselves would sully
that. But it would be pretentious to feel that way about
entertainment fiction. The way I look at it, I'm an
entertainer."

   Workman Finds Clever, Quirky Books,
   Marketed With Great Care, Bring Success

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- For 20 years, Barbara Ann Kipfer kept a list
of things that make her happy. Each year for 10 years, she
mailed it to Peter Workman, the founder and owner of Workman
Publishing. "I just knew it was a Workman book," says Ms.
Kipfer, who makes her living writing dictionaries in
Connecticut. "They do books that are offbeat but classy."
   Last year, Mr. Workman told Ms. Kipfer he was skeptical
about turning her 22,000 favorite things into a book but
wanted to try. The list was shortened, the title was changed
from "The Happy Book" to "14,000 things to be happy about,"
and the book was packaged in a small, chunky size with a
clever cover.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Some readers might quarrel with flannel sheets, the word
"boo" or other specific entries, but "14,000 things" was on
the Publishers Weekly paperback best-seller list for five
weeks, and it has sold well over 100,000 copies. It's
building the kind of gentle cult following that proves it's a
Workman book after all.
   Over the past 22 years, <PERSON>Workman</PERSON> has developed a reputation
for books that are clever, quirky and distinctively designed.
Most are high-quality paperbacks priced below most comparable
competing books, and they tend to be cookbooks, humor books,
calendars or children's books. <PERSON>Workman</PERSON> has also pioneered in
merchandising non-book items in bookstores and books in
non-bookstores.
   "Unlike almost any other publisher, you can look at a book
and say, `That's a Workman,'" says <PERSON>Judith Riven</PERSON>, an executive
editor at <ORGANIZATION>Hearst Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s Avon Books. "They are smart and
original and catch trends before anybody else. French bistros
are all the rage now, but <PERSON>Workman</PERSON> already has a bistro
cookbook out there."
   Workman books are so "endearing and intriguing that they
almost compel you to give them special display," adds <PERSON>Michael
Brownstein</PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION>Atticus Bookstore Cafe</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New
Haven</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn</LOCATION>.
   What sets a <PERSON>Workman</PERSON> book apart isn't just subject and
design but also the way it's published.
   "<PERSON>Workman</PERSON> is my first choice of all the publishers in
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, provided I'm selling their kind of book," says
literary agent <PERSON>Elise Goodman</PERSON>. "If you sell a book to a big
conglomerate publisher and they pay a big advance and do a
big advertising campaign, you feel like the author gets lost
-- and the sales reflect it. Workman never gives up on a
book, and they don't treat them like soap: Each one gets
special handling."
   Such treatment is the centerpiece of the <PERSON>Workman</PERSON>
publishing philosophy and helps explain why writers often
accept lower advances to be published there. While other
publishers keep vowing to improve their profits by publishing
fewer books better, their lists rarely dwindle. For years,
<PERSON>Workman</PERSON> has limited itself to about 20 new titles a year,
although more than <PERCENT>75%</PERCENT> of its books are still in print -- a
phenomenal record -- so its publicists and commissioned
salespeople keep quite busy.
   Workman's whimsy, eccentricity and obsessive attention to
detail flow from <PERSON>Mr. Workman</PERSON>, the 51-year-old founder. A
tall, gawky man with a lopsided grin and the bemused air of a
mad scientist, he works in a chaotic office where even the
floor is piled high with books and papers. <PERSON>Mr. Workman</PERSON> hates
meetings and memos, but he approves every project, book
jacket and print run and still writes every royalty check.
Editors and art directors are given enormous freedom to dream
up projects, but once they're picked, everyone is expected to
be as compulsive and disciplined as <PERSON>Mr. Workman</PERSON> to make them
succeed.
   The high-pressure frenzy at <ORGANIZATION>Workman</ORGANIZATION>'s funky downtown
offices -- and the boss's sometimes hot temper -- have driven
some authors and employees away. <PERSON>Helene Siegel</PERSON>, who once
managed production at <LOCATION>Workman</LOCATION>, says, "<PERSON>Peter</PERSON> doesn't
compromise, and he can wear you down." She says she respects
him enormously but also remembers him getting mad that she
wouldn't jump on a plane to inspect some pillows printed with
a <PERSON>Workman</PERSON> character when she was eight months pregnant.
   "Every project drives us nuts; it's always missed
deadlines and crisis management," says <PERSON>James Martin</PERSON>, who has
supervised the printing of Workman books at <ORGANIZATION>Banta Co.</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Menasha</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wis.</LOCATION>, for 18 years. "We have never, ever had a book
whose cover didn't change three, four times." Nevertheless,
<PERSON>Mr. Martin</PERSON> is a big admirer of <PERSON>Mr. Workman</PERSON>. "<PERSON>Peter</PERSON> is a
genius and people here will do anything they can to
accommodate him," <PERSON>Mr. Martin</PERSON> says.
   Most <PERSON>Workman</PERSON> employees feel the same way. And <PERSON>Mr.
Workman</PERSON>'s methods have produced extraordinary growth. <PERSON>Mr.
Workman</PERSON> refuses to divulge sales and profits, but <PERSON>Ron Jaffe</PERSON>,
senior marketing director for Waldenbooks, says that sales of
<PERSON>Workman</PERSON> items there have doubled in the past three years
alone. <PERSON>Bert Snyder</PERSON>, <PERSON>Workman</PERSON>'s sales manager, adds that one
title in three sells more than 100,000 copies.
   Workman's success starts with <PERSON>Mr. Workman</PERSON>'s instinct for
picking projects, but the publisher finds it hard to analyze
his formula. "Something begets something," he says in his
laconic way. "Things sort of unfold."
   Workman's marketing panache dates back to a time when the
publisher had more energy than money. Its first big success,
"The Toy Book," was a how-to book of simple toys kids can
build. An advertising budget was impossible in <DATE>1972</DATE>, so
author <PERSON>Stephen Caney</PERSON> made "hundreds" of appearances, says <PERSON>Mr.
Workman</PERSON>, and sales started to climb. (Still in print, though
with a new cover, the book has sold more than 320,000
copies.) To this day, <PERSON>Workman</PERSON> routinely mounts far longer
author tours than most publishers, while spending little on
ads.
   <PERSON>Mr. Caney</PERSON>'s penchant for dreaming up projects for kids has
led to a series of <PERSON>Workman</PERSON> "activity books" that come with
props. New fall selections from <PERSON>Mr. Caney</PERSON> include "Make Your
Own Time Capsule" and "Teach Yourself Tap Dancing," which
follow the best selling "Bug Book &amp; Bug Bottle" and "Beach
Book &amp; Beach Bucket" by other authors.
   It was a cartoon cat in red sneakers that put <PERSON>Workman</PERSON> on
the map. B. Kliban's goofy "Cat" book has sold nearly a
million copies, but it was a slow starter. To promote it in
<DATE>1975</DATE>, most of the <PERSON>Workman</PERSON> staff ran around selling copies at
the annual cat show at <ORGANIZATION>Madison Square Garden</ORGANIZATION>. Then <PERSON>Mr.
Workman</PERSON> decided to give display posters of the cartoon cat to
bookstores. The posters were so popular, patrons stole them,
so bookstores asked to sell the posters, and <PERSON>Workman</PERSON> took up
licensing.
   Pretty soon <PERSON>Workman</PERSON> was selling Kliban cat mugs, pillows,
stationery and aprons. Cat calendars led <PERSON>Workman</PERSON> into other
calendars, and today it sells millions, featuring teddy
bears, dolls, herbs, games and tips for saving the planet, as
well as 21 kinds of Page-A-Day calendars, a format it
pioneered.
   The <PERSON>Workman</PERSON> way is to start small, print conservatively
and promote like mad, sometimes even for a book published
years before. A good example of how its persistence pays off
is "What to Expect When You're Expecting." When the book came
out in <DATE>1984</DATE>, bookstore orders were a paltry 6,800 copies.
"Booksellers said, `Who needs another pregnancy book,
especially one that isn't written by a doctor?'" recalls
<PERSON>Workman</PERSON>'s sales manager.
   But <PERSON>Workman</PERSON> was convinced there was a market for the book.
Written by health writer <PERSON>Arlene Eisenberg</PERSON> and her two
daughters (one a nurse and both with children), the
month-by-month guide tells women how they'll feel and look
and answers questions they might feel silly bugging a doctor
with.
   To keep copies moving, <PERSON>Workman</PERSON> offered a special deal to
bookstores that would order five or more. And <PERSON>Workman</PERSON> paid to
send the authors to annual meetings of obstetricians and
pediatricians, who then recommended the book. Now, with sales
of more than a million, "What to Expect" is the top selling
book on pregnancy, and unlike most books, it has higher sales
every year.
   The authors followed it with "What to Eat When You're
Expecting" and "What to Expect the First Year," and <PERSON>Workman</PERSON>
has just signed them up for two more books. "We could get
more (advance) money from another publisher, but I don't want
to work for anyone else," says <PERSON>Mrs. Eisenberg</PERSON>. "<PERSON>Peter</PERSON> is the
only publisher I know who would allow updates with every
printing."
   Workman's respect for contributors can be carried to
extremes. Take the teddy bears. Every year, about 20,000
teddy bear lovers send photos of their favorite pals to
<PERSON>Workman</PERSON> to audition for a place in <PERSON>Workman</PERSON>'s popular Teddy
Bear calendar. The winning bears are sent by <ORGANIZATION>Federal Express</ORGANIZATION>
to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> for a photo shoot, but if the designers want to
pose a bear named, say, "Ralph" in a dress, a Workman staffer
will call the bear's home "to make sure no one minds," says
editor <PERSON>Suzanne Rafer</PERSON>.
   There have been bombs at <LOCATION>Workman</LOCATION>, including a humor book
called "Sneakers," children's books by <PERSON>William Buckley</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Anne Beattie</PERSON> and a spoof of Chinese horoscopes called "Help,
I Just Found Out I'm a Pig."
   But <PERSON>Mr. Workman</PERSON> keeps trying new things. Last year, he
bought small, classy fiction publisher Algonquin Books of
<LOCATION>Chapel Hill</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C</LOCATION>. This <DATE>fall</DATE>, along with such Workmanlike
titles as "All I Need to Know I Learned From My Cat," <PERSON>Workman</PERSON>
will publish an uncharacteristic book about AIDS, for
teen-agers, and its first novel ever. The novel, "Good
Omens," is a funny book about the end of the world.
   "It just felt good," says <PERSON>Mr. Workman</PERSON>.

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- At this year's booksellers' convention, the
workshops have names such as "Bargain Books in Bad Times," so
it isn't surprising that bookstore-growth is slowing.
   Bernard Rath, executive director of the American
Booksellers Association, says that the number of bookstores
in the U.S. rose 76% during the 1980s, second only to
fast-food restaurants in growth among businesses. But with
the current retail recession, growth has slowed considerably
for both chain stores and independents.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   One of the most aggressive chains in the <DATE>1980s</DATE> was Crown
Books, which grew to 250 stores from 20 in a decade, but
closed more stores than it opened in <DATE>1990</DATE>. "We grew very fast
and so did a lot of other people," says <PERSON>Robert Haft</PERSON>,
president of <ORGANIZATION>Crown Books Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Landover</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION> "Now we're
growing by making stores bigger." Having made its name with
small discount stores, <PERSON>Crown</PERSON> is now building what it calls
Super Crown stores, which also give <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> discounts on
bestsellers but offer three times the selection. But it is
building fewer of them. "We used to add 40 stores a year,"
says <PERSON>Mr. Haft</PERSON>. "Now it will be more like 10 or 15."
   Mall traffic has been particularly dismal during the
recession, and one of the principal growth strategies of the
mall-focused Waldenbooks chain for the next five years will
be adding mini-bookstores within existing <ORGANIZATION>Kmart</ORGANIZATION> stores.
(<ORGANIZATION>Kmart Corp.</ORGANIZATION> is its parent company.) <PERSON>Charles Cumello</PERSON>,
recently named chief executive of the book chain, says that
about 1,000 Readers' Markets, as the book departments are
called, will be added to Kmarts by <DATE>1995</DATE>: there are about 300
now. <PERSON>Mr. Cumello</PERSON> said these departments have their own staffs
and sell everything from inexpensive children's books to <MONEY>$40</MONEY>
coffee table books.
   ---
   For all the anxiety in the book business these days, one
sign of health is the growing diversity: There isn't just one
hot book that everybody is counting on this fall to rocket
them out of the sales slump.
   Booksellers predict that <PERSON>Tom Clancy</PERSON>'s new novel, "The Sum
of All Fears," will easily outsell everything else; <PERSON>Mr.
Clancy</PERSON> was among the best-selling author of the <DATE>1980s</DATE> and he
hasn't had a new techno-thriller for two years. But for
well-stocked independent bookstores, and even many of the
chains with broader title selections, sales are spread more
widely than ever before. Discriminating readers are looking
for distinguished literary works, or a great gift book, or a
computer book, or a children's book, and not just the latest
bestseller.
   Although <PERSON>Hut Landon</PERSON>, owner of an independent bookstore in
<LOCATION>Mill Valley</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, is standing in a long line to pick up an
advance reading copy of <PERSON>Mr. Clancy</PERSON>'s book, he says the book
won't be a huge seller in his store. "It's a chain book,"
says <PERSON>Mr. Landon</PERSON>. "What I'm really looking for here at the <ORGANIZATION>ABA</ORGANIZATION>
is the great mid-list books, something book-lovers will
embrace like `Middle Passage,'" a novel about a freed slave
that won the <DATE>1990</DATE> National Book Award.
   Thus, while booksellers hope the sequel to "Gone With The
Wind" will be good enough to satisfy fans of the original
(the new book was delayed a year, amid rumors of problems),
they're more excited about the latest literary novels by <PERSON>Pete
Dexter</PERSON>, <PERSON>Anne Tyler</PERSON>, <PERSON>Amy Tan</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Jane Smiley</PERSON>. The industry
buzz is that those four in particular, all of whom have loyal
and expanding readerships, have written their best books yet.
   Two other very unusual fall books beginning to attract
attention: <ORGANIZATION>Simon &amp; Schuster</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Paramount
Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, is excited about "Wild Swans," a
nonfiction epic about three generations of women in a Chinese
family. The author <PERSON>Jung Chang</PERSON>, a professor of literature in
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, has written about her Red Guard mother and her
grandmother, who was a warlord's concubine.
   And then there is "The Boomer Bible," a sprawling,
wickedly funny modern rewriting of the <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION> that's meant to
sum up a generation. In this <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION>, the prophets include
<PERSON>Sartre</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kafka</PERSON> (the book of <PERSON>Frankie</PERSON> and Johnny), and Psong
23 begins: "Money is my thing: It's all I want." Knowing the
knack of publisher <PERSON>Workman</PERSON> for turning offbeat paperbacks
into megasellers -- "The Preppie Handbook," for one, --
booksellers are betting that "The Boomer Bible" will become a
cult classic at the very least.
   "Top quality is one thing," says <PERSON>Mr. Haft</PERSON> of Crown Books,
"But will people pay more than <MONEY>$20</MONEY> for first novels and
mid-list books by undistinguished authors? What bothers me is
when the publishers reprint a book that was <MONEY>$15</MONEY> two years
ago, and make it <MONEY>$20</MONEY>."
   For their parts, publishers say books are still a great
value and prices haven't risen faster than inflation.
   ---
   With a large booth and two major parties, the most visible
newcomer at this year's <ORGANIZATION>ABA</ORGANIZATION> convention is the fledgling
publishing arm of <ORGANIZATION>Walt Disney Co</ORGANIZATION>. New York-based <ORGANIZATION>Hyperion</ORGANIZATION>
will publish non-Disney titles and adult books, but its major
attraction here is an unusual tie-in to a Disney kids' movie.
   The studio's next animated feature, scheduled for release
in <DATE>November</DATE>, is "Beauty and the <LOCATION>Beast</LOCATION>." The heroine is <LOCATION>Belle</LOCATION>,
whose pert nose is often seen buried in a book. <PERSON>Lauren Wohl</PERSON>,
the ex-librarian marketing director for <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION>'s children's
books, knew that <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> would launch several illustrated
books at the film's release. But she also wanted to do an
additional book that would encourage children to read more --
like <ORGANIZATION>Belle</ORGANIZATION>.
   The result is "Belle's Book of Books," a small, purple
hardcover diary with drawings from the movie, so children can
write down all their favorite books. Disney agreed to offer
the book to members of the booksellers' group at a discount
(<MONEY>$1.75</MONEY> each). Soon, promotional packets will be sent to movie
theater-owners suggesting they arrange cross-promotions with
local bookstores.
   "It's up to them, but they could offer free popcorn for
people who bought Disney books first," says <PERSON>Ms. Wohl</PERSON>, "And
booksellers could do something like offer the book for <MONEY>$2</MONEY>, or
nothing, with a ticket stub from the movie."

   Success of `Scarlett' Is an Epic in Itself

   NEW YORK -- "Tomorrow is another day," said Scarlett
O'Hara at the conclusion of "Gone With the Wind." Little did
she know.
   As the sequel to Margaret Mitchell's classic continues to
infect the country with "Scarlett" fever, publishers marvel
that a book almost universally disdained by critics could be
such a huge hit with readers. But most of them agree that
"Scarlett" is a phenomenon they won't be able to duplicate
easily -- if at all.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Every few years a book comes along that gets people who
don't usually go into bookstores to buy a book," says <PERSON>Stuart
Applebaum</PERSON>, a senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Bertelsmann AG</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Bantam
Doubleday Dell Publishing Group</ORGANIZATION>. "`<PERSON>Scarlett</PERSON>' will be the new
Mount Everest that every publisher wants to climb, but I
think it will be impossible to repeat."
   Indeed, no other novel in the history of the printed word
has sold so many copies as quickly as "Scarlett: the Sequel
to <PERSON>Margaret Mitchell</PERSON>'s Gone With the Wind." The <PERSON>Mitchell</PERSON>
classic is second only to the <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION> in total sales of 28
million copies, but that's over more than 50 years. Americans
bought 1.2 million copies of the sequel in six weeks, and
sales are expected to near two million by <DATE>Christmas</DATE>. There
are three million copies in print outside the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, and the
book is the No. 1 seller in more than a dozen countries.
   For <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner Inc.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Warner Books</ORGANIZATION> unit, a <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY>
gamble on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> rights to "Scarlett" and a costly marketing
campaign are paying off handsomely. With estimated profits of
<MONEY>$4</MONEY> on every <MONEY>$25</MONEY> book, <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> could make <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY> or more on
the hardcover alone, plus millions more when it publishes the
paperback next year. There has also been a burst in sales of
author <PERSON>Alexandra Ripley</PERSON>'s three previous romance novels, all
<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> paperbacks.
   Though one critic skewered "Scarlett" as "cultural
cannibalism," and others called it "crude" and "phony," such
barbs didn't deter readers like <PERSON>Elizabeth Gilbert Fortune</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mrs. Fortune</PERSON>, a widow who divides her time between
<LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION> and a <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> ranch, is an avid reader of romance
novels who reserved her copy of the sequel three months in
advance. "I was crazy about it," she says, "and I'm just so
irritated about these terrible reviews."
   Bookstore managers say the overwhelming share of buyers in
the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> has been women, many in their 30s and 40s -- and a
good number weren't regular customers. "You could see they
were uncomfortable in the store, and some weren't even sure
of the title," says <PERSON>David Schwartz</PERSON>, owner of five bookstores
in <LOCATION>Milwaukee</LOCATION>.
   Not surprisingly, sales are heaviest in the South. "I was
right back at <LOCATION>Tara</LOCATION> right at the first page," says <PERSON>Barbara
Lindsay</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Columbia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION> "I started reading it the day I got
it, and I never put it down till I finished. I read the
reviews, but I wanted to judge it myself." She loved it.
   <PERSON>Sara Lorusso</PERSON>, who manages marketing services for
fertilizer and chemicals at a farm cooperative near <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>,
isn't in a hurry to read the book but had to own it. "I never
thought it would be as good as the original; and I have a
feeling I'll be disappointed, because I heard it's sunk to
the level of a romance novel," she says. "But it's a Southern
thing. There is this undying curiosity as to what would have
happened with these magnetic characters. You've thought about
it all your life."
   Publishers and booksellers were caught unprepared for the
"Scarlett" rush, but <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> did well in building public
anticipation. "Common wisdom in publishing said the book just
wouldn't work," says <PERSON>Mr. Applebaum</PERSON> of Bantam. "When it was a
year late, it was supposed to be in real trouble. Then once
it appeared and sold like crazy, awful reviews came out and
everybody said sales would die fast."
   Even Waldenbooks, a bookstore chain with a good track
record for predicting what will sell, ordered far too few
copies. "We actually had customers fighting in stores because
we didn't have enough copies to cover all the advance
registrations," says <PERSON>Charles Cumello</PERSON>, chief executive officer
of Waldenbooks, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Kmart Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
   "Scarlett" is running circles around other best-selling
authors. <PERSON>Tom Clancy</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Putnam Berkley</LOCATION> novelist who ranks as
the best-selling fiction writer of the past decade, sold 1.7
million copies of his last thriller. But even his books don't
move this fast: <ORGANIZATION>Book Inventory Systems Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which
distributes books to 25 extra-large bookstores, says it sold
more copies of "Scarlett" in one day than it sold of <PERSON>Mr.
Clancy</PERSON>'s newest novel in seven weeks.
   Warner made some very shrewd publishing decisions. The
decision to choose a romance writer for the project was made
by the <PERSON>Mitchell</PERSON> estate, but <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> targeted its strategy to
capture the vast audience of romance readers even in choosing
the title. Focus groups composed mostly of women were given
"Scarlett" and another title the publisher liked much better,
"Tomorrow Is Another Day."
   "All these women said `<PERSON>Scarlett</PERSON>' was `more romantic' as a
title," says <PERSON>Laurence Kirshbaum</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Warner Books</ORGANIZATION>.
"At least a third had never read the original, but everybody
knows who Scarlett is."
   Reservation signs in bookstores and an excerpt trumpeted
on the front page of Life magazine kindled curiosity. But
<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> refused to release advance copies of the book to store
buyers or critics; though the extreme hostility of critics
was a shock, <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> didn't expect raves from traditional
fiction reviewers and wanted books to hit stores before the
reviews were out. The media, not knowing plot details, went
after the first-day-of-sale story.
   On <DATE>Sept. 25</DATE>, the day the book came out, bookseller
<PERSON>Mitchell Kaplan</PERSON> had crews from all three television networks
pacing his <LOCATION>Coral Gables</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, store. "Every time someone
went to the counter, three cameras would follow, hoping they
were buying it," says <PERSON>Mr. Kaplan</PERSON>.
   "I'd be glad to take credit for orchestrating all this;
but the fact is, this was consumer democracy in action," says
<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> Books' <PERSON>Mr. Kirshbaum</PERSON>.
   Some publishers say the interest in the original book was
so universal that it guaranteed success to a sequel. <PERSON>Phyllis
Grann</PERSON>, chief executive of the <ORGANIZATION>Putnam Berkley</ORGANIZATION> publishing unit
of <ORGANIZATION>Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>MCA Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, says: "I
don't think there is a single other book with such a hold on
the American public as `Gone With the Wind,' and I'd be wary
of attempting to translate this success into something else."
   Not that some won't try. Pocketbooks, a division of
<ORGANIZATION>Paramount Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Simon &amp; Schuster</ORGANIZATION> unit, will
publish a sort-of sequel next <DATE>summer</DATE>. The new book -- "H" --
will deal with what happened to <PERSON>Emily Bronte</PERSON>'s character
Heathcliff during the three years he disappeared from
"Wuthering Heights."
   The publisher, however, wants to distance its effort from
the "Gone With the Wind" sequel. <PERSON>Irwyn Applebaum</PERSON>, publisher
of Pocketbooks, says the company will market "H" as a
"compelling first novel" and will not attempt to "create
`Scarlett Fever II.'"
   He adds: "We're very wary of the sequel skepticism after
`Scarlett.' Whenever I mention our book to someone in the
industry, they begin rolling their eyes, as if to say, `Oh
no, here comes another one.'"

   NEW YORK -- Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group Inc.
restructured its sales and marketing operations and named a
new publisher at its Bantam division.
   Although Bantam Doubleday Dell is "quite profitable," said
Paul D. Neuthaler, chief executive officer, the restructuring
is designed to make the publisher more efficient at a time
when the recession is crimping book sales.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I can't give you specific numbers, but I can tell you
that books on the best-seller lists are selling fewer copies
now," he said. "We've got 15 best sellers {out of 65 possible
slots} from all our divisions on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION>
best-seller lists this <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. But in healthier economic
times, that would have translated into a lot more copies
sold."
   The moves follow an announcement less than two months ago
that the publisher's Doubleday division, which continues to
narrow its losses, would cut its number of annual titles
published by about onethird.
   Under the reorganization, <ORGANIZATION>Bantam Doubleday Dell</ORGANIZATION>, which
comprises the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> publishing operations of <ORGANIZATION>Bertelsmann AG</ORGANIZATION> of
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, will have four sales forces organized according to
how the books are distributed, including retail, wholesale
and special markets (non-bookstores). Currently, there are
two sales forces, one for Bantam hardcover and paperback
titles and <ORGANIZATION>Dell</ORGANIZATION> paperbacks, and another handling Doubleday
and Delacorte hardcovers. <PERSON>Mr. Neuthaler</PERSON>, who said he doesn't
expect the overall head count in sales to change, said, "We
think this will bring us closer to the customers for our
books."
   <PERSON>Stephen Weitzen</PERSON> was named as president of the sales and
marketing division. <PERSON>Mr. Weitzen</PERSON>, 33 years old, will continue
to run the Promotional Books Division for the time being,
said a spokesman. Previously, running sales and marketing was
among the duties of <PERSON>Jack Hoeft</PERSON>, who continues as president
and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION>Bantam Doubleday Dell</ORGANIZATION>.
   Separately, the <ORGANIZATION>Bantam</ORGANIZATION> division appointed a new publisher,
<PERSON>Matthew Shear</PERSON>, 35, who was director of sales and marketing
for <ORGANIZATION>Bantam</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Dell</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Shear</PERSON> succeeds <PERSON>Jeff Stone</PERSON>, 38, who
resigned for personal reasons after about 15 months in the
job. A spokesman said <PERSON>Mr. Shear</PERSON> has been given expanded
duties, including marketing responsibility for Bantam
authors.
   Also, <PERSON>Mark Faller</PERSON>, 39, was named to the new post of senior
vice president, publishing operations, at <LOCATION>Bantam</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Faller</PERSON>
was formerly controller of the <ORGANIZATION>Bantam Doubleday Dell</ORGANIZATION>
publishing group. A spokesman said that <PERSON>Mr. Faller</PERSON> will take
over administrative details for Bantam President <PERSON>Linda Grey</PERSON>,

development.

   Publishers and bookstore owners heading to the annual
convention of the American Booksellers Association, which
starts today in Las Vegas, predict strong sales this fall and
plentiful best sellers after a year that was disappointing
for many.
   "Our sales were soft for most of last year, but I think
you're going to see a pretty upbeat community of booksellers
and publishers," says Ronald Jaffe, senior marketing director
for the Waldenbooks unit of K mart Corp. "It's like night and
day. Our sales are terrific right now, and from what we've
seen about new books coming out this fall, we're very
excited."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I think the doom and gloom has receded," says <PERSON>Brigitte
Weeks</PERSON>, editor in chief of <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner Inc.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Book-of-theMonth
Club</ORGANIZATION>. "People are feeling more secure, and there are going to
be some really big books this <DATE>fall</DATE>, including new novels by
<PERSON>Jean Auel</PERSON> and <PERSON>Colleen McCullough</PERSON>. There are some really
classy, important books coming out, too, from authors like
<PERSON>John Updike</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gabriel Garcia Marquez</PERSON>."
   At this annual gathering, hundreds of publishers of all
sizes tout their forthcoming books to thousands of bookstore
owners, hoping to boost sales for the fall season, the
biggest in publishing. "We use this as a forum, to find out
what kind of season to look forward to," says <PERSON>Bernard Rath</PERSON>,
executive director of the association. Although many <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>
publishers complained that their high-brow industry is
meeting in a low-brow town, attendance is expected to be
about 25,000, says <PERSON>Mr. Rath</PERSON>, slightly ahead of last year's
convention in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>
   The association recently said bookstore sales jumped <PERCENT>63%</PERCENT>
between <DATE>1982</DATE> and <DATE>1987</DATE>, and sales reportedly rose about <PERCENT>11%</PERCENT> in
<DATE>1989</DATE>. However, a recent report by the <ORGANIZATION>American Association of
Publishers</ORGANIZATION> showed only a <PERCENT>4.1%</PERCENT> increase in sales of adult
hardcover books in the <DATE>first quarter of 1990</DATE>. Various surveys
predict that growth will be better than that in the next few
years, but not as strong as during the boom years of the
mid-1980s.
   Despite a consensus among publishing executives that this
<DATE>fall</DATE> will bring more blockbusters than last year's
disappointing lineup, there are still some jitters in the
industry after tumultuous times. During the past six months,
several big publishers took substantial write-downs against
earnings, several small publishers were put up for sale and
an earlier wave of big mergers was followed by consolidation
and staff cuts at many houses. At the same time, growth of
the big bookstore chains was slowing down.
   "I'd say the mood is optimistic but far from euphoria,"
says <PERSON>David Godine</PERSON>, a small, independent publisher based in
<LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>. "You can't look around and say this industry is in
terrific shape."
   "We're fairly bullish as we head into the <DATE>summer</DATE>, but I'm
cautious," says <PERSON>Jack Hoeft</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Bantam Doubleday
Dell Publishing Group</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Bertelsmann AG</ORGANIZATION>. The
company's <ORGANIZATION>Doubleday</ORGANIZATION> unit had an especially difficult year in
<DATE>1989</DATE> -- racking up losses, switching top management and
cutting back the list of titles sharply. "The cautious part
is because I'm getting some reports from customers that the
bookselling market in general is still pretty soft," says <PERSON>Mr.
Hoeft</PERSON>.
   "It has been a sobering time, but there is an optimism
again," says <PERSON>Joni Evans</PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION>, which is
owned by the <PERSON>Newhouse</PERSON> family's <ORGANIZATION>Advance Publications Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "We
all feel a bit like <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON>: Things are better, but at any
moment, they could take a wrong turn." <PERSON>Ms. Evans</PERSON> said that,
as part of a new conservatism in publishing, "the bubble has
definitely burst on advances."
   <PERSON>Allan Lang</PERSON>, an agent and consultant, adds, "Sales and
marketing and editorial departments are being trimmed all
over the industry. Publishers aren't publishing fewer titles,
but they are publishing smaller initial print runs and paying
for fewer author tours."
   Nevertheless, booksellers and publishers are ready to
celebrate in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>, with dozens of author lunches and
lavish cocktail parties at local casinos and mansions. "The
mood will definitely be good: This is always a happy
convention," says <PERSON>Mr. Lang</PERSON>. "Publishers are eternal
optimists, or they couldn't remain sane in this business."

<TEXT>
<P>
The collective murmur at the end of this strange year and decade in publishing 
climbed straight out of <PERSON>Lewis Carroll</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"Curiouser and curiouser," people throughout the industry were remarking. For 
the most part, their comments were not accompanied by optimistic smiles. 
</P>
<P>
The final few weeks of <DATE>1989</DATE> seemed to reflect the turbulence of the entire 10 
years. One publishing executive, heading off to a holiday party, wryly summed 
it up when he suggested that these days, you couldn't be too sure. What was 
billed as a festive gathering just might turn out to be another corporate 
beheading. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the infamous <LOCATION>Halloween Massacre</LOCATION>, where a roomful of <PERSON>E. P. Dutton</PERSON> 
editors and other employees learned that their jobs had been eliminated along 
with <PERSON>Dutton</PERSON>'s entire adult trade (mainstream fiction and nonfiction) division. 
As fast as anyone in the room could say "trick or treat," the 137-year-old 
operation became an imprint within <ORGANIZATION>Penguin USA</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
At <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Robert L. Bernstein</PERSON> closed the year with the stunning 
announcement that he would leave the company he had headed for 23 years. 
Whether <PERSON>Bernstein</PERSON>'s departure was entirely voluntary or was encouraged by the 
<PERSON>Newhouse</PERSON> family, which owns <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION>, remained a matter of speculation. 
Within weeks, <PERSON>Alberto Vitale</PERSON>, president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Bantam Doubleday 
Dell</ORGANIZATION>, was named to replace <PERSON>Bernstein</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
If <PERSON>Bernstein</PERSON> had been regarded, as one top executive from another house put it, 
as "a man of letters," <PERSON>Vitale</PERSON> was hailed as a money man -- "a guy," said this 
executive, "who can wield an ax and bring order into a situation of confusion." 
</P>
<P>
Money might be an unacceptable topic at refined dinner parties, but in the 
<DATE>1980s</DATE>, publishing was in a kind of revolution. And as Chairman Mao so 
succinctly reminded us, a revolution is not a dinner party. 
</P>
<P>
"Never forget that this is a business and not the Library of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>," <PERSON>Stuart 
Applebaum</PERSON>, one of <PERSON>Vitale</PERSON>'s former colleagues at <ORGANIZATION>Bantam Doubleday Dell</ORGANIZATION>, said. 
</P>
<P>
Just before <ORGANIZATION>Thanksgiving, Simon &amp; Schuster</ORGANIZATION> revealed that it would declare a 
<MONEY>$140-million</MONEY> pretax write-off -- translation: a hefty loss -- this year. <ORGANIZATION>Simon 
&amp; Schuster</ORGANIZATION> is this country's largest book publisher. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the industry said the year had been marked not only by 
disproportionately large advances but by record returns to publishers of unsold 
books. For books that were in the large-advance category, print runs that 
turned out to be excessive made these returns particularly painful. 
</P>
<P>
Coming as they did on the heels of a series of major corporate consolidations 
and takeovers, the events of late <DATE>1989</DATE> did seem to rattle what had until then 
been a general mood of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, I think they are all having the same kind of nausea," said 
<PERSON>Roger Straus</PERSON>, the head of <ORGANIZATION>Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux</ORGANIZATION>, one of the few surviving 
independent publishing houses. Entering the <DATE>1990s</DATE>, <PERSON>Straus</PERSON> said, publishing was 
"a dinner where everyone was attacked by the same ptomaine." 
</P>
<P>
In particular, <PERSON>Straus</PERSON> objected to what he called this decade's "auction fever," 
where "a handful of agents have fueled the greed of authors by telling them: 'I 
can get you <MONEY>$3 million</MONEY> for this book.' " But then, he added, "you have the 
publishers being stupid enough to say, 'Yeah, I'll give you that kind of 
money.' " 
</P>
<P>
Gigantic advances, said <PERSON>Applebaum</PERSON>, the vice president for publicity and 
promotion at <ORGANIZATION>Bantam Doubleday Dell</ORGANIZATION>, "are probably having a deleterious effect 
on book publishing, because basically they are not earning (the advances) back 
through sales and other revenues, thereby producing red ink, thereby further 
torpedoing profits at the publishing houses." 
</P>
<P>
One example that immediately came to the minds of several publishing executives 
was "My Turn," the acerbic best-selling autobiography by former First Lady 
<PERSON>Nancy Reagan</PERSON>. Though the book has garnered immense attention, it was 
commissioned by <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> with an advance widely reported to be in the 
<MONEY>$2-million</MONEY> range. "They're never going to get that back," a rival publisher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At <LOCATION>Houghton Mifflin</LOCATION>, <PERSON>John Sterling</PERSON>, editor-in-chief of adult trade books, 
concurred, talking about a "fever that has gone bad" in publishing. 
</P>
<P>
"You have these two giant dark engines that have driven a lot of what is wrong 
in adult trade books," Sterling said. "Number 1 is the size of the advances. 
Number 2 is the size of advance shipments." 
</P>
<P>
If looking at this year in publishing also means looking at the decade, 
Sterling, for one, points out, it's important to note that for much of the <DATE>last 
10 years</DATE>, the publishing industry has benefited from a general upswing in the 
American economy. "We have not really had a serious downturn in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
economy or in the publishing business in the <DATE>last seven years</DATE>," <PERSON>Sterling</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"So much of what has happened has depended on a healthy economy. That kind of 
healthy economy just did not happen in the <DATE>1970s</DATE>." 
</P>
<P>
A positive environment for business in general has allowed book chains to 
introduce discount pricing as a daily event in book-selling and book-buying. In 
turn, publishers became more inventive in seeking out new marketing ventures. 
Once considered a rather rarefied commodity, the clothbound books of the <DATE>1980s</DATE> 
were to be found on sale in drugstores, right alongside the mousse and 
conditioner, and in supermarkets, not far from the roast beef. 
</P>
<P>
Given the rising price of hair products and beef, moreover, discount-priced 
cloth books did not seem like much of an indulgence. 
</P>
<P>
The book jacket may carry a <MONEY>$20</MONEY> price tag, but "people say, 'golly, I can get 
<PERSON>Stephen King</PERSON> for <MONEY>$12.56</MONEY>!' " Sterling said. 
</P>
<P>
Spurred largely by the book chains, the change in cloth pricing combined with 
more aggressive marketing by publishers to alter consumer buying patterns. 
Readers who once habitually waited for a title to appear in paperback now began 
rushing to buy it in cloth. One resulting trend of the last decade and the <DATE>last 
year</DATE> was a simultaneous softening of paperback sales and boosting of cloth-book 
consumption. 
</P>
<P>
"You learned to hook your customer," the vice president of one publishing house 
said. "You first trained people not to be able to wait for the paperback; then 
after a while they wanted to go for a higher quality." 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, she continued, cloth sales were simply seen in a different 
numerical light. "We went from a huge best seller being 75,000 copies to it 
being 1.2 million," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"At the beginning of the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, you could not imagine first printings of 
500,000. The fact that there are any is absolutely amazing. The fact that 1.5 
million people walk into a bookstore and pay <MONEY>$20</MONEY> -- and up -- for a hardcover 
book is mind-boggling." 
</P>
<P>
And "obviously," as <PERSON>Roger Straus</PERSON> noted in what might be the first lesson of The 
Economics of Publishing 101, "it is far more profitable to sell a <MONEY>$20</MONEY> book than 
a <MONEY>$4.95</MONEY> book." 
</P>
<P>
"The culture just moves too fast," said Sterling. "People used to wait for the 
paperback. Not any more." 
</P>
<P>
That appetite for instant literary gratification has been carefully nurtured by 
publishers who have applied new skills and sophistication to the art of 
creating and enhancing a market. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be that publicity was looked upon as a kind of frivolous enterprise 
that you gave to the pretty, but ditzy, person who really didn't have a future 
on the editorial side," <PERSON>Applebaum</PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION>Bantam Doubleday Dell</ORGANIZATION>, said. Now, he 
continued, along with eager and aggressive publicity departments, "you have 
whole new worlds of media coaching and strategic positioning which heretofore 
have not gone into this courtly business known as book publishing." 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Applebaum</PERSON> was quick to add, "Really, you need that. Unlike other businesses 
that are akin to ours -- such as television, movies or recorded music -- 
publicity, which includes book reviews, is overwhelmingly the driving force 
behind book sales." 
</P>
<P>
Apologizing to <PERSON>Webster</PERSON>, one publisher cited "conglomeratization" and 
commercialism as the two hallmarks of the decade in publishing. Neither might 
bode well for the big houses, he conceded, but in their wake, he suggested, the 
smaller presses may begin to enjoy their long-awaited flowering. 
</P>
<P>
At <ORGANIZATION>North Point Press</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>, however, editor-in-chief <PERSON>John Shoemaker</PERSON> was 
less sanguine. His house was born along with the decade, making its debut on 
<DATE>Jan. 1, 1980</DATE>, and although "our business has shown very steady growth," 
<PERSON>Shoemaker</PERSON> said that among the smaller presses, "I think all of us are fighting 
an uphill struggle to survive." 
</P>
<P>
After the initial surge of power from the bookselling chains, "the <DATE>last six 
years of this decade</DATE> have seen a tremendous growth in viable independent 
bookstores" that tend to be more receptive to the titles of small-press houses, 
<PERSON>Shoemaker</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think that we publish too many titles in this country" -- about 40,000 
titles annually, by most reliable accounts -- "and we are all competing for a 
steadily shrinking number of buyers in the face of an increasingly illiterate 
society," <PERSON>Shoemaker</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could sell one book to the number of people who attend a single <ORGANIZATION>Dallas 
Cowboys</ORGANIZATION> football game, we could be on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> best-seller list for 
six months," <PERSON>Shoemaker</PERSON> said. "But that doesn't happen too often." 
</P>
<P>
Among the larger publishers, the excesses in advances and print runs surely 
will be corrected, many in publishing predicted. "It's gotten out of hand," 
said <PERSON>Roger Straus</PERSON>, for one, "and I think the hand is about to be tightened." 
</P>
<P>
But any constraints will definitely affect the reader, he predicted. "The 
reader will have fewer books of some quality than he has," <PERSON>Straus</PERSON> said, citing 
"belles lettres, essays, biography and experimental novels" as genres that may 
feel the pinch. 
</P>
<P>
Still, not everyone in publishing was humming dirges as the year and the decade 
came to an end. The climate was cold, <PERSON>Stuart Applebaum</PERSON> said, and "it is not 
going to improve dramatically in the near future." But "there's nothing wrong 
with publishing presently that could not be cured by more consumers going into 
bookstores and buying books."

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS:
Summertime Best Sellers: Irrationality Pays
---
By David Brooks</HL>
<DD> 06/02/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Allan Bloom</PERSON>'s "The Closing of the American Mind" is now the best-selling non-fiction book in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. 
It is nice when a serious book sells, and when certain institutions in the book business are betrayed by their assumption that such books won't -- notably the book clubs that wouldn't put <PERSON>Mr. Bloom</PERSON>'s book on their lists, the publisher that scarcely promoted it, and the bookstores that didn't place orders for it until customers were standing in line. 

   But <PERSON>Mr. Bloom</PERSON>'s success creates a tension in his argument. 
If easygoing nihilism has really made the American mind flaccid, why are these thousands plunking down <MONEY>$18.95</MONEY> for the book? 
Certainly there's nihilism, but maybe it's not so easygoing. 

   Reason, much celebrated by <PERSON>Mr. Bloom</PERSON>, takes a beating in the rest of the month's fast-selling books. 
<PERSON>Bernie S. Siegel</PERSON>'s "Love, Medicine &amp; Miracles: Lessons Learned About Self-Healing From a Surgeon's Experience With Exceptional Patients" (<ORGANIZATION>Harper &amp; Row</ORGANIZATION>, 239 pages, <MONEY>$15.95</MONEY>) is a warmed-over marshmallow from a practitioner of the love me, hug me, take-out-my-appendix school of medicine. 
<PERSON>Dr. Siegel</PERSON> writes: "The simple truth is, happy people generally don't get sick," and "In my opinion, about three-fourths of the side effects of radiation and chemotherapy result from the patient's negative beliefs." 
<PERSON>Dr. Siegel</PERSON>, who teaches at <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION>, has taken the obvious point, that the mind has immense influence on the health of the body, dragged it beyond its logical extreme, and then packaged it in a book sickly with the meaningless pop-psychology aphorisms that have made <PERSON>Leo Buscaglia</PERSON> huggable. 

   <PERSON>Dr. Siegel</PERSON> bases his diagnoses on the question "Why did you need the illness?" and his treatment on making people "feel good about themselves," whatever that means. 
He walks into patients's rooms and declares "I need to hug you." 
He delivers sunny lectures to comatose patients, and he argues that people can make brain tumors go away by imagining rocket ships flying through their heads blasting away at malignant cells. 
If hospitals were more hospitable, <PERSON>Dr. Siegel</PERSON>'s gooey love bombs wouldn't have an eager audience. 

   Reason also flies out the window in "Communion: A True Story" (<ORGANIZATION>Beech Tree/Morrow</ORGANIZATION>, 295 pages, <MONEY>$17.95</MONEY>), <PERSON>Whitley Strieber</PERSON>'s account of how he was kidnapped by aliens from another planet. 
<PERSON>Mr. Strieber</PERSON> is a fantasy novelist who claims that aliens nabbed him a few times from his cabin in <LOCATION>upstate New York</LOCATION> and gave him the once-over. 
At a crucial moment, he asked one of the aliens if he could smell her, and he discovered that aliens smell like cardboard with an "organic sourness in its odor" and a hint of cinnamon. 
<PERSON>Mr. Strieber</PERSON> didn't immediately remember his close encounter, but with the help of some psychologists -- including <PERSON>Budd Hopkins</PERSON>, who has also written a UFO book -- he is able to piece together his experiences. 
He makes his case fairly well, but his prose is so leaden that one finishes the book not really caring if aliens exist. 

   <PERSON>Clive Barker</PERSON> is the highly touted <PERSON>Stephen King</PERSON> of the future (<PERSON>Stephen King</PERSON> is doing the touting) and he lives up to his billing. 
"The Damnation Game" (ACE/Putnam, 379 pages, <MONEY>$18.95</MONEY>) is a mortifying thriller about a gambler who is taken from prison to serve as bodyguard to an eccentric industrialist. 
The industrialist is also paying off gambling debts because he didn't honor the old maxim: You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, know when to walk away, and know when not to play with a superhuman demon who can slither through hell and transform normal people into glowing, slimy flesh-eaters. 
<PERSON>Mr. Barker</PERSON> certainly extends one's appreciation of the possible. 
He is a fine writer; the best parts of this book occur before the real scary stuff begins. 

   Rounding off this month's collection of irrationality is "Texasville" (<ORGANIZATION>Simon &amp; Schuster</ORGANIZATION>, 542 pages, <MONEY>$18.95</MONEY>), <PERSON>Larry McMurtry</PERSON>'s voyage into quirkiness. 
<PERSON>Mr. McMurtry</PERSON>'s town, <LOCATION>Thalia</LOCATION>, is glutted with bed-hoppers, maniacs, juvenile delinquents, stupid pets, suicidal bankers and war-mongering <ORGANIZATION>OPEC</ORGANIZATION> bashers -- all brought to peaks of comic energy by the boom-and-bust cycle of the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> oil industry. 
Madness reigns and it is quite amusing. 
"Texasville" is perfect beach reading -- 30 pages and swim, 30 more pages and nap. 
More than 30 pages without a break might give you a headache.

   Plethora of Books Related to Gulf War
   Being Snapped Up, With More Planned

   Americans are rushing to buy books on the Persian Gulf
crisis, spurring sales of a number of existing tomes and
prompting publishers to launch others.
   Many of the hottest titles are books that were packaged
quickly after Iraq invaded Kuwait last August. Times Books, a
unit of Random House, has shipped 415,000 copies of "Saddam
Hussein and the Crisis in the Gulf" and just ordered another
printing. The book was whipped together in 2 1/2 weeks by New
York Times correspondent Judith Miller and Laurie Mylroie, a
Middle East expert from Harvard, and shipped to bookstores in
October, but sales escalated sharply last week.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The Rape of <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>," an "instant book" featuring
eyewitness accounts of Iraqi brutality by Kuwaitis who fled
the country, was shipped to bookstores the day before
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s war deadline, and it is moving briskly.
<ORGANIZATION>Knightsbridge Publishing Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which says it printed more than
a million copies, advertised the paperback with 15-second
television spots, a very rare tactic for selling a book. The
spots featured photographs of Kuwaitis and a voice saying:
"Read it and you'll know why we're there."
   Bookstores are just now getting -- and can't keep enough
of -- "Desert Shield Fact Book," a workbook-like tome
assembled by GDW Games, a company that makes war games. A
spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Berkley Books</ORGANIZATION>, which distributes the <MONEY>$10</MONEY>
paperback, says: "You're supposed to take this big map of the
region out of the book and tack it to your wall while you
watch the war." The rest of the book includes lists and
drawings of equipment used by all sides, troops, tactics and
a glossary of military jargon. <PERSON>David Shanks</PERSON>, president of
<ORGANIZATION>Berkley</ORGANIZATION>, reports that Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON> "has called
twice for copies."
   One of the best-selling books on the conflict isn't an
instant book but a rediscovered one. "Republic of Fear: The
Inside Story of <LOCATION>Saddam</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>" was first published in <DATE>1989</DATE> by
the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION> and virtually ignored. Written
by an Iraqi expatriate under the pen name <PERSON>Samir al-Khalil</PERSON>,
the book became a hot property after the invasion of <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>
and was quickly republished by <ORGANIZATION>Pantheon Books</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of
<ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION>. Though somewhat clumsily written, the book has
sold thousands of copies because it is authoritative and has
proved prophetic. Among other things, the author wrote that
<PERSON>Saddam Hussein</PERSON> is fully willing "to start World War III"
rather than give up power voluntarily.
   Why such an appetite for information about a continuously
televised war?
   "People just don't get the background and feel for the
area on television that you can get in a book," says <PERSON>Erik
Barnum</PERSON>, manager of <PERSON>Sidney Kramer</PERSON> Books in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>,
which specializes in history and politics. "I don't think
there was such a need to know when this was a war being waged
by diplomats. Now it's a soldier's war. Starting last week,
my regular clients from the government were joined by average
citizens, who come in and ask, `What can I read that will
tell me why we're there?'"
   <PERSON>Mr. Barnum</PERSON> has plenty of titles to help answer that
question, from a quickie book of photographs called
"Operation Desert Shield: The First 90 Days" to the scholarly
"Lessons of Modern War. Volume II -- The Iran-Iraq War." The
latter is by national security expert <PERSON>Anthony Cordesman</PERSON>, who
is spending most of his time on television these days,
analyzing the war for <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>.
   Also popular in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>: a book called "If War Comes .
. . How to Defeat <PERSON>Saddam Hussein</PERSON>." Written by a military
historian named <PERSON>Trevor Depuy</PERSON> for a tiny publisher called Hero
Books, the book has sold 30 copies in two days at <PERSON>Mr.
Barnum</PERSON>'s store.
   Curiosity about the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> is helping a number of
books published about the region some time ago. <PERSON>Thomas
Friedman</PERSON>'s award-winning "From <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Jerusalem</LOCATION>" has been
a paperback bestseller for five months, and <ORGANIZATION>Signet</ORGANIZATION>, a
division of <ORGANIZATION>Penguin Books USA</ORGANIZATION>, has re-issued a <DATE>1987</DATE> book
called "The Saudis: Inside the Desert Kingdom."
   Publishers of fiction are using the war to raise sales of
adventure books. <ORGANIZATION>Bantam Doubleday Dell</ORGANIZATION> has put decals on
thousands of copies of a techno-thriller called "Warriors"
that did only so-so sales when it came out in <DATE>June</DATE>. "It's a
War Over the Arabian Desert]" read the stickers in red, white
and blue. And sales are picking up.
   Still to come: some very serious books analyzing the
region, its leaders and the current conflict. The Free Press,
a division of <ORGANIZATION>Macmillan</ORGANIZATION>, couldn't believe its luck when
<PERSON>Efraim Karsh</PERSON>, a professor of war studies at <ORGANIZATION>Kings College</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>University of London</ORGANIZATION>, announced in <DATE>November</DATE> that he has been
working on a biography of <PERSON>Saddam Hussein</PERSON> for three years.
"Saddam Hussein: A Political Biography" is due in <DATE>April</DATE>.
   This <DATE>summer</DATE>, beach reading will surely include the new <PERSON>Tom
Clancy</PERSON> thriller, "The Sum of All Fears," set in the <LOCATION>Middle
East</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Clancy</PERSON> says that he decided long ago to set the
book there and that the events bear a spooky resemblance to
current events, though he is adding "some topical
references."

STUDIO CITY FIRM TAPS INTO GROWING MARKET FOR BEST SELLERS ON TAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year ago, <PERSON>Michael A. Viner</PERSON> read "A Brief History of Time," a recent book 
about the universe by <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION> scientist <PERSON>Stephen W. Hawking</PERSON>. And where Hawking 
saw stars, <PERSON>Viner</PERSON> heard the sound of money. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was going to be a big hit, no one else did," <PERSON>Viner</PERSON> recalled. The 
hard-cover version of Hawking's book was published by <ORGANIZATION>Bantam Books</ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON>Viner</PERSON>'s 
Studio City company, <ORGANIZATION>Dove Books</ORGANIZATION> on Tape, stepped in front of <LOCATION>Bantam</LOCATION> and other 
publishers and bought the audio rights to record the book on audiocassette 
tapes for a <MONEY>$2,000</MONEY> advance. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, <PERSON>Viner</PERSON> had a six-hour, four-volume tape version of Hawking's book 
for sale -- retail price <MONEY>$24.95</MONEY> -- in bookstores nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Viner</PERSON>'s hunch paid off. Hawking's book was one of the most popular nonfiction 
books of <DATE>1988</DATE>, and has spent the past nine months on The Times' best-seller 
list. As for <ORGANIZATION>Dove</ORGANIZATION>, it's sold 40,000 copies of the tape version of the book, 
making it <ORGANIZATION>Dove</ORGANIZATION>'s biggest seller since <PERSON>Viner</PERSON> started the company <DATE>four years ago</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Picking Winners 
</P>
<P>
Most of <ORGANIZATION>Dove</ORGANIZATION>'s success, in fact, rides on <PERSON>Viner</PERSON>'s sixth sense about what new 
books will be big sellers and popular with the burgeoning audio-book market, 
while moving nimbly to get the rights to those books. 
</P>
<P>
Dove, which is two-thirds owned by <PERSON>Viner</PERSON>, also banks on its ties with some 
well-known authors, including <PERSON>Viner</PERSON>'s close friend, best-selling fiction writer 
<PERSON>Sidney Sheldon</PERSON> ("Master of the Game," "The Sands of Time") to supply raw 
material for its tapes. Sheldon also likes the books-on-tape idea and is a part 
owner of <ORGANIZATION>Dove</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The market for books on tape is now roughly <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> and growing by <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> to 
<PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> a year, industry executives estimate. Although a limited number of audio 
books had been around for years, sales began surging in <DATE>1985</DATE> after Dove and the 
major book publishers jumped into the market to take advantage of the 300 
million audiocassette players Americans own. 
</P>
<P>
Dove's sales this year will hit <MONEY>$4 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY>, nearly double last 
year's <MONEY>$2.5 million</MONEY>, while its unit sales may double to 600,000 taped books, 
<PERSON>Viner</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The company, with 17 employees, has a catalogue of 140 taped books for sale 
that it's produced and has about 30 more in production. The eclectic author 
list ranges from <PERSON>Howard Cosell</PERSON> to <PERSON>Charles Dickens</PERSON>. Dove also distributes an 
additional 50 to 60 titles that were produced by other companies. 
</P>
<P>
It helps that <PERSON>Viner</PERSON>, 45, who also is a movie and TV producer (<PERSON>Sheldon</PERSON>'s 
"Windmills of the Gods" for TV), has close ties to the entertainment world. For 
the past 14 years, he's been married to actress <PERSON>Deborah Raffin</PERSON> ("Death Wish 
3"), who has also narrated and produced some of the tapes. <PERSON>Viner</PERSON>'s Hollywood 
links have helped attract such stars as <PERSON>Roger Moore</PERSON> and <PERSON>Roddy McDowall</PERSON> to 
narrate Dove's books for a modest <MONEY>$2,000</MONEY> fee, plus royalties. He contends that 
Dove stands apart from the competition by using higher quality tapes and 
production. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tough Competitor

Dove's rivals naturally disagree that <ORGANIZATION>Dove</ORGANIZATION>'s tapes are superior, but Dove looks 
for any edge it can find. The audio-book market has several competitors, 
notably publishing giants <ORGANIZATION>Simon &amp; Schuster</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Gulf &amp; Western</ORGANIZATION>, 
and <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Affiliated Publications</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Daniel Roth</PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Simon &amp; Schuster</ORGANIZATION>'s audio division, claimed 
that his company and <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> are the biggest players in audio, while <ORGANIZATION>Dove</ORGANIZATION> 
is among the largest independent competitors. For <ORGANIZATION>Dove</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Simon &amp; Schuster</ORGANIZATION> 
and <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> are formidable foes simply because of the huge marketing clout 
they already have with bookstore chains. 
</P>
<P>
"Our ability to cross-promote our audiocassettes with the hardcover division or 
the paperback division is a considerable advantage," <PERSON>Roth</PERSON> said. "That's very 
appealing to an author. Your product comes into one house and is marketed 
successfully in three different venues." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, <ORGANIZATION>Simon &amp; Schuster</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> also distribute some of their 
audio books through Dove to reach a wider audience. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Audience on Wheels 
</P>
<P>
Much of that audience listens to books in their cars. "Americans drive over 2 
billion miles a year," and <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT> of U.S.-made cars are now sold with cassette 
players, <PERSON>Roth</PERSON> said. When stuck in a traffic jam, drivers can forgo the news and 
listen to <PERSON>Joan Rivers</PERSON> reading her autobiography, "Enter Talking," or <PERSON>Terry 
Southern</PERSON> reading his book "The Magic Christian." 
</P>
<P>
The major bookstores, such as Waldenbooks and <ORGANIZATION>B. Dalton/ Barnes &amp; Noble</ORGANIZATION>, 
have racks devoted to audio books. Most of the books are condensed to fit on 
two 90-minute cassettes, which are sold in one package that retails between 
<MONEY>$9.95</MONEY> and <MONEY>$14.95</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
Taping a book can certainly add to an author's bank account, although it pales 
compared to possible six-figure paperback rights. A best seller on tape can 
earn an author such as Hawking or Sheldon an extra <MONEY>$30,000</MONEY>, but the payoff more 
often is <MONEY>$5,000</MONEY> to <MONEY>$15,000</MONEY>, <PERSON>Viner</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
But getting the books out to the public on tape involves lots of production and 
financial steps. 
</P>
<P>
Once <PERSON>Viner</PERSON> or one of his staff has selected a book for tape, <ORGANIZATION>Dove</ORGANIZATION> must purchase 
the audio rights. 
</P>
<P>
"Publishing houses have about three-quarters of the rights themselves," <PERSON>Viner</PERSON> 
said, while the most popular authors have kept the oral rights to their works. 
"The <PERSON>Sidney Sheldons</PERSON>, the <PERSON>Tom Clancys</PERSON>, etc., will be selling them through their 
own agents," <PERSON>Viner</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
To land the rights, <ORGANIZATION>Dove</ORGANIZATION> must pay an advance and a royalty on sales. The 
advance can range as high as <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY>, with royalties typically at <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> of the 
tape's wholesale sales for a veteran author. <PERSON>Viner</PERSON> said the average wholesale 
price for a twin-cassette book is about <MONEY>$7.50</MONEY>, so an author might pick up <MONEY>75 
cents</MONEY> per copy. A big-name author, though, can command up to <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> of the tape's 
retail price in royalties, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Dove has used many celebrity readers, such as <ORGANIZATION>Academy Award</ORGANIZATION> winners 
<PERSON>Paul Scofield</PERSON> and <PERSON>Julie Andrews</PERSON>, sometimes it signs the book's author. Most 
readers, <PERSON>Viner</PERSON> said, need several hours to compensate for pronunciation errors 
and other mistakes. One exception was sportscaster <PERSON>Howard Cosell</PERSON>, who read a 
three-hour version of his own book, "I Never Played the Game," in three hours 
and 6 minutes. <PERSON>Viner</PERSON> said <PERSON>Cosell</PERSON> "made seven mistakes in the whole tape and 
updated his book while he read. It was the most phenomenal reading I have ever 
seen." 
</P>
<P>
After the master tape is produced, Dove sends the tape out to be mass-produced 
and distributed to the bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Costs, Profit 
</P>
<P>
So the <MONEY>$7.50</MONEY> average wholesale price of a Dove tape probably would include <MONEY>75 
cents</MONEY> to the author, <MONEY>20 cents</MONEY> to the reader, and <MONEY>$4.50</MONEY> in production, 
advertising and overhead costs, <PERSON>Viner</PERSON> said, leaving him about <MONEY>$2.05</MONEY> in gross 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Viner</PERSON> said some of <ORGANIZATION>Dove</ORGANIZATION>'s top bookstore customers get a hefty discount on 
the price for big orders, so that the <MONEY>$7.50-per-tape</MONEY> average -- and <ORGANIZATION>Dove</ORGANIZATION>'s 
profit -- is actually less. Bottom line: Dove tries to earn an average pretax 
profit of <MONEY>$1.50</MONEY> per tape.

<P>
If ever the global village was on display, it was so during the furor that 
erupted over the publication of <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>'s "Satanic Verses." Suddenly, it 
was clearer than ever that the world -- not just any one country -- reads 
books. And the world reacts to books. 
</P>
<P>
The <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> affair made the timing of <ORGANIZATION>Vintage International</ORGANIZATION>, an imprint of 
20th-Century classics from around the world, seem almost eerie. The new line of 
paperbacks made its debut <DATE>March 28</DATE> with the simultaneous release of 15 titles. 
Its immediate front-runner in sales was <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s earlier novel "Shame." 
</P>
<P>
A <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> imprint, <ORGANIZATION>Vintage International</ORGANIZATION>, "was supposed to tie in with 
'Satanic Verses' because we had 'Shame,' " <PERSON>Jeff Stone</PERSON>, the vice president and 
marketing director of <ORGANIZATION>Vintage Books</ORGANIZATION>, said. "We were prepared" for a reaction, 
<ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said, "but we could never be this prepared." 
</P>
<P>
"The international character of culture is a fact of life in the <DATE>20th Century</DATE>," 
said <PERSON>Erroll McDonald</PERSON>, vice president and executive editor of Vintage. McDonald, 
who is overseeing the launch of <ORGANIZATION>Vintage International</ORGANIZATION>, has been the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> editor 
for <PERSON>Wole Soyinka</PERSON>, the first African to win the Nobel Prize for literature, as 
well as <PERSON>Oscar Arias Sanchez</PERSON>, <PERSON>Edward Said</PERSON>, <PERSON>Manuel Puig</PERSON> and <PERSON>Helmut Schmidt</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"Science and technology; music and art; popular culture and fashion; graphic, 
home and industrial design, even cuisine: The development of all has benefited 
from a convergence of international influences," <ORGANIZATION>McDonald</ORGANIZATION> said. "This has not 
been true of American publishing. For a variety of reasons, American publishing 
has tended to be isolationist." 
</P>
<P>
Vintage International, said <ORGANIZATION>McDonald</ORGANIZATION>, seeks to "combat the conventional wisdom 
that Americans are at heart xenophobic and that international literature is, 
for the most part, inaccessible and unsalable." 
</P>
<P>
To begin to attain that aim, marketing director Stone took the formula of 
distinctive, highly recognizable packaging that helped boost Vintage 
Contemporaries to success a few years back. Also a trade paperback line, 
Vintage Contemporaries (or "VC" in Random House-speak) served as the literary 
launch pad for <PERSON>Jay McInerney</PERSON>, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Stone spiced up his recipe-for-success by banishing the word "foreign" in favor 
of the loftier term "international." 
</P>
<P>
"We are no longer talking about foreign writers, we are talking about 
international writers," Stone said. "It's like cars. We don't drive foreign 
cars. We drive international cars. We're getting rid of that xenophobia." 
</P>
<P>
The effort to move beyond literary ethnocentrism also provided a vehicle for 
resurrecting a backlist of Vintage authors that <PERSON>Martin Asher</PERSON>, editor in chief 
of Vintage Books, termed "just staggering." A year ago, when <PERSON>Asher</PERSON> came to 
Vintage from the <ORGANIZATION>Quality Paperback Book Club</ORGANIZATION>, he said he was stunned to 
discover an inventory that included <PERSON>Camus</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mann</PERSON>, <PERSON>Nabokov</PERSON>, <PERSON>Lessing</PERSON>, <PERSON>Primo Levi</PERSON>, 
<PERSON>E. M. Forster</PERSON>, <PERSON>V. S. Naipaul</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gabriel Garcia Marquez</PERSON>. Also on the Vintage 
backlist were works by <ORGANIZATION>Ford Madox Ford</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Amos Oz</PERSON> and <PERSON>Marcel Proust</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
By "giving them a cohesiveness as a body of work" offered by a single 
publisher, <PERSON>Asher</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Vintage International</ORGANIZATION> was "really trying to present them 
to the American public as books rather than as things you had to read in 
school." 
</P>
<P>
It was a matter of "taking them off the backlist and putting them on the 
frontlist," <PERSON>Asher</PERSON> went on. "Bringing these books from the back of the store to 
the front of the store. 
</P>
<P>
"Buyers will see the new line in paperback," <PERSON>Asher</PERSON> says, "and say, 'Oh, it's a 
book now, not an artifact.' We're trying to position these books as books, not 
as furniture" -- i.e., cloth. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Vintage International</ORGANIZATION>'s aggressive marketing will bring out 56 titles by the 
end of the year, by which time more than 1 million copies of <ORGANIZATION>Vintage 
International</ORGANIZATION> books are scheduled to be in print. 
</P>
<P>
The primary guideline for each work published in the series is that "it must be 
written by a writer universally acknowledged to be a master of the <ORGANIZATION>20th Century</ORGANIZATION> 
or by a major contemporary literary writer whose works have been translated 
into various languages throughout the world," <ORGANIZATION>McDonald</ORGANIZATION> said. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, though the authors may be famous, the titles are less so. 
Another theory behind the conception of <ORGANIZATION>Vintage International</ORGANIZATION> is that the big 
names will support less familiar titles, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to weave them all together," said <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION>, one of the original 
"longhairs" behind Vintage Contemporaries. "It becomes the ultimate universe." 
</P>
<P>
One difference between VC and the new imprint lies in the age range. The 
Contemporaries targetted an audience that began at about age 20, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said. 
The Vintage International series will hope to climb up the age ladder, he said, 
aiming for readers who average between 25 and 45 years of age. 
</P>
<P>
But what pleases Stone and his colleagues most of all is that the minute the 
Vintage International series hit the bookstores here, they began to see a 
response. 
</P>
<P>
"These books are selling!" Stone crowed. "I mean, this is not a public service 
announcement. We are seeing '<ORGANIZATION>Lolita</ORGANIZATION>' become a best seller." 
</P>
<P>
TROUT FISHING TURNS 20. At <LOCATION>Houghton Mifflin</LOCATION>, three books from a decidedly 
American author, <PERSON>Richard Brautigan</PERSON>, have been reissued in a paperback omnibus 
edition that honors their 20th anniversary as separate paperback editions. 
"Trout Fishing in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>," "The Pill Versus the Springhill Mine Disaster" and 
"In Watermelon Sugar" sold 2 million copies worldwide and made <PERSON>Brautigan</PERSON> an 
instant underground hero after they were released as <PERSON>Seymour Lawrence/Delacorte</PERSON> 
titles two decades ago. Lawrence declared that he had discovered "an American 
original in the tradition of <PERSON>Mark Twain</PERSON> and Ring Lardner" when he reissued the 
books <PERSON>Brautigan</PERSON> had first published in a small press in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Brautigan</PERSON>'s works, his friend <PERSON>Tom McGuane</PERSON> said, reflected an author who was 
"crazy with optimism." They were emblematic of the era of <LOCATION>Woodstock</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Jimi 
Hendrix</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Meher Baba</PERSON>, the original don't-worry, be-happy guy. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, <PERSON>Brautigan</PERSON>'s own center failed to hold. He ran out of money, and 
worse, in his own mind, out of readers. In the <DATE>fall of 1984</DATE> he shot himself at 
his <LOCATION>Bolinas</LOCATION> retreat. He left no suicide note. But before he ended his life he 
gave his trout fishing rod to his friend <PERSON>McGuane</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
ALLELUIA! ALLELUIA! It is no coincidence that this column about paperback books 
appears on this particular <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. Easter has come and gone, but this week 
marks the resurrection in Book Review of a paperback best-seller list. This 
list has been absent for more than a year, and while it was on sabbatical it 
had a little format transplant. The old list included 10 mass-market paperback 
titles and five trade-paperback titles. Fiction and nonfiction were not 
divided. In its new incarnation, the paperback best-seller list will include 
seven fiction and seven nonfiction titles. Mass-market and trade-paperback 
titles will not be divided. 
</P>
<P>
The old list was based in part on data from wholesalers and 
other-than-bookstore outlets. The new list, like its weekly cloth cousin here 
in The Times, is based on a poll of local bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
A final transformation: The old paper list appeared weekly. In its new, 
improved edition, it will be published monthly, in conjunction with The Book 
Trade, itself a monthly feature appearing the <DATE>first Sunday</DATE> of each month. The 
polling will be done weekly, however. Interested readers may learn Times paper 
(as well as cloth) rankings as early as the <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> before the <DATE>Sunday</DATE> of 
publication by calling (213) 237-4336 after <TIME>11 a.m.</TIME> 
</P>
<P>
The Book Trade, a monthly feature, will next appear <DATE>May 1, 1989</DATE>. Next week's 
feature: Bloody <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.

<HEAD>Political Literature Booming as Restrictions on Politics Fade</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDUARDO GALLARDO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political literature is booming as the
bans and restrictions imposed by <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s right-wing military
government appear to be coming to an end.
   Books ranging from <PERSON>Gabriel Garcia Marquez</PERSON>'s latest to
controversial political essays have become best-sellers, and
literary experts believe the trend will continue because of the
outgoing government of conservative President Gen. <PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON>.
   After seizing power in a bloody <DATE>1973</DATE> coup, <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> decreed a
total ban on political activities. <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> was closed, political
parties disbanded and severe censorship on books and the news media
were enforced.
   In the last few years, however, most bans have gradually
disappeared as the nation has prepared to pick a successor to
<LOCATION>Pinochet</LOCATION>. The vote, in the first presidential election since <DATE>1970</DATE>,
is scheduled for <DATE>Dec. 14</DATE>.
   Political activity now is virtually free, bringing a boom to
political literature.
   Experts say the long period they lived without access to a
variety of freely published information left Chileans ripe for the
wave of political literature.
   ``The public was thirsty for political information,'' said
<PERSON>Ignacio Gonzalez</PERSON>, a journalist who authored ``The Day Allende
Died,'' one of the most successful books in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> in <DATE>1988</DATE>.
   The novelized book is a vivid, well-researched account of events
at the government house on <DATE>Sept. 11, 1973</DATE>, the day <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> toppled
elected President <PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON>. Allende, a Marxist, died in the
takeover.
   Gonzalez' book sold 11,000 copies in three months, a notable
figure in this small <LOCATION>South American</LOCATION> country where sales of 3,000
books is considered a best-seller.
   ``I think people reacted with enthusiasm because of the
attraction of learning things that had been forbidden to them for so
long,'' <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> said in an interview.
   Even more successful was ``The Silent Revolution,'' a report on
the achievements of the <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> government, by <PERSON>Joaquin Lavin</PERSON>, a
conservative economist.
   Published in <DATE>December 1987</DATE>, <PERSON>Lavin</PERSON>'s book sold over 150,000 copies
in 11 months, becoming the second-largest selling book in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s
history, <PERSON>Lavin</PERSON> claims. He said it places second only to ``Farewell
to the 7th Regiment,'' a novel based on the <DATE>1879</DATE> war that <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> won
over <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Bolivia</LOCATION>.
   An official at the <ORGANIZATION>Chilean Book Chamber</ORGANIZATION> said that although no
precise figures have been compiled, <PERSON>Lavin</PERSON>'s claim appears correct.
   ``I just tried to tell Chileans how the country is that they live
in these days,'' <PERSON>Lavin</PERSON> said. ``The book shows them how their country
has changed.''
   Gonzalez and <PERSON>Lavin</PERSON> believe public interest on political books
will survive the end of military rule.
   Book records show that at least three political titles have
appeared in the weekly lists of 6 top-selling books for over a year.
   The best-selling non-political book in recent months was ``The
General in his Labyrinth,'' a biography of <PERSON>Simon Bolivar</PERSON>, the
Venezuelan-born liberator of <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>, by Colombian Nobel
Prize-winning author <PERSON>Gabriel Garcia Marquez</PERSON>. The book has sold
65,000 copies in eight months.
   Experts say it's too early to determine the effects the
availability of political books is having on Chileans.
   Among the leading books on political matters in recent years are
those by <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lavin</PERSON>.
   Also, ``Gen. <PERSON>Prats</PERSON>' Memoirs,'' by Gen. <PERSON>Carlos Prats</PERSON>, the army
commander under Allende who was assassinated in exile in <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>,
published postumously; ``The <PERSON>Buchi Phenomenon</PERSON>,'' a
bigraphical-political study on <PERSON>Hernan Buchi</PERSON>, the pro-government
presidential candidate in the <DATE>December</DATE> election; ``<LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> Here, the
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and Perestroika`` as seen by a Chilean journalist,
<PERSON>Bernardo</PERSON> de la Masa; ``Yes or No,'' a study prior to last <DATE>October</DATE>'s
referendum in which voters rejected a military proposal to extend
<PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>'s rule until <DATE>1997</DATE>, by <PERSON>Hermogenes Perez de Arce</PERSON>, a
right-wing author and politician.

<HEAD>Best Seller List a Cakewalk for Moonwalk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Michael Jackson</PERSON>'s autobiographical ``Moonwalk''
has floated to the top of <ORGANIZATION>The New York Times</ORGANIZATION> non-fiction best
seller list less than a month after it reached bookstores, its
publisher said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The <MONEY>$15.95</MONEY> hard cover book will debut at No. 2 on the list <DATE>May 8</DATE>
and hit No. 1 on the <DATE>May 15</DATE> list, Doubleday announced. The Times
issues its placings 10 days in advance on a recorded telephone
message.
   The list is based on sales in a sampling of bookstores around
the nation. ``Moonwalk'' had an initial printing of 300,000 copies
and is going into a second printing of 150,000 more, said <ORGANIZATION>Doubleday</ORGANIZATION>
spokeswoman <PERSON>Jacqueline Deval</PERSON>.
   The book will debut at No. 1 on <ORGANIZATION>The Los Angeles Times</ORGANIZATION> best
seller list <DATE>Sunday</DATE> and was No. 1 on the <ORGANIZATION>Sunday Times</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> list
<DATE>May 1</DATE>, she said.
   ``Moonwalk'' includes 19 color photos and 78 black and white
photos of its entertainer author. <PERSON>Ms. Deval</PERSON> said she understood
from bookstores and articles that it was being bought largely by
teen-agers, who have been targeted by the publisher through radio
promotions and giveaways.

   NEW YORK -- A controversial how-to manual on suicide for
the terminally ill will hit No. 1 on the New York Times
Best-Seller list next week for advice and how-to books.
   "Final Exit" has sold more than 40,000 hard-cover copies
nationwide and the publisher is rushing 60,000 copies to
bookstores starting next week.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But as sales soar and publicity about the book explodes,
even some of the people profiting directly find themselves
with mixed emotions.
   <PERSON>Leonard Riggio</PERSON>, co-owner of <ORGANIZATION>Barnes &amp; Noble Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which
includes the <ORGANIZATION>B. Dalton, Barnes &amp; Noble</ORGANIZATION> and Doubleday chains,
wrote to his store managers suggesting that "Final Exit" be
available "only on a special-order basis" because of fears
that the book could be misused. In the end, <PERSON>Mr. Riggio</PERSON> left
it up to individual stores to decide.
   Of all those involved in "Final Exit," perhaps the only
person to suffer no qualms at all is its author, <PERSON>Derek
Humphrey</PERSON>, a right-to-die promoter who founded the non-profit
<ORGANIZATION>Hemlock Society</ORGANIZATION>. "I'm very proud and pleased," says <PERSON>Mr.
Humphrey</PERSON>.
   "I don't know how long it will last as a bestseller, but I
expect its sales on a moderate level to continue for a long
time," says <PERSON>Mr. Humphrey</PERSON>. "I think the man and woman on the
street have seen these news stories about people fighting for
years to pull the plug on someone {terminally ill} and they
are genuinely alarmed. They want to have the option of a
quiet death on their bookshelf."

<HEAD>Buyers' Frenzy Erupts Over `Satanic Verses'</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Satanic Verses, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KILEY ARMSTRONG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The decision by large bookstore chains to stop displaying or
selling ``The Satanic Verses'' triggered a buyers' frenzy and
shortages at independent stores, dealers said <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   ``We got in 25 copies yesterday; they were all reserved,'' said
<PERSON>John Evans</PERSON>, owner of <LOCATION>Lemuria Bookstores</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Jackson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Miss.</LOCATION> ``I wish I
had been smart enough to order 150 _ I blew it.''
   ``I think the right honorable <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON> is making a best seller
out of it,'' said <PERSON>Sam Weller</PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION>Zion Book Stores</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Salt
Lake City</LOCATION>, where neither the stores nor the public library could
keep the popular <MONEY>$19.95</MONEY> novel on their shelves.
   ``Nobody bought it until they started hollering about it,''
agreed <PERSON>Howard Canada</PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION>Howard's Bookstore</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Bloomington</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Ind</LOCATION>.
   The independents said their sales heated up after the <PERSON>Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini</PERSON> offered a bounty <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> for the killing of ``The
Satanic Verses'' author <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON> and his publishers.
   On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, the <PERSON>B. Dalton</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Barnes &amp; Noble</ORGANIZATION> chains, which have
more than 1,250 stores, said they would pull the book from their
shelves, but a spokesman refused to say whether it would not be sold
at all or simply not displayed. Waldenbooks, the nation's largest
bookseller, directed its stores <DATE>Thursday</DATE> to remove the book from
shelves, but to sell it upon request.
   Rushdie apologized on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, saying he regretted if the book
distressed ``sincere followers of Islam,'' but it was not clear
whether <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> would accept his remarks.
   <PERSON>Rebecca Morehouse</PERSON>, manager of a Waldenbooks store in <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION>, said the company's president told stores <DATE>Saturday</DATE> that
they may display the book if they don't feel threatened.
   She wanted to sell the book, but ``I'm just not going to wave it
like a red flag in front of a bull.'' Her store was out of stock and
awaiting a second printing.
   The small stores also couldn't get enough.
   ``Some of my customers called and wanted to buy it; they didn't
want to read it _ they just wanted to make a political statement,''
said <PERSON>Dave Unowsky</PERSON>, owner of the sold-out Hungry Mind bookstore in
<LOCATION>St. Paul</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Minn.</LOCATION>, and a board member of the <ORGANIZATION>American Booksellers
Association</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We've gotten hundreds of the requests in the past hundreds of
days,'' said an employee, who identified himself only as <PERSON>Pat</PERSON>, at <LOCATION>New
York City</LOCATION>'s Coliseum bookstore. He said the store had sold 155
copies since the end of <DATE>December</DATE>, with the ``big sales'' starting
two weeks ago.
   ``When the book was first published, we got 50 or 60 copies and
sold them immediately; yesterday, by <TIME>1 o'clock</TIME>, we had over 50 phone
requests,'' said <PERSON>Fred Bass</PERSON>, owner of the Strand bookstore in <LOCATION>New
York City</LOCATION>.
   ``There's been tremendous demand since <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and there's no
way I can get more. I've already had a call from somebody who
offered me <MONEY>$40</MONEY> for a copy,'' said Bass.
   ``I think you'll start seeing first editions on the market very
quickly. <MONEY>$50</MONEY> to <MONEY>$75</MONEY>,'' said <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>. ``I'm talking about 30 days, 60
days.''
   Even if the apology is accepted, ``I think it will still be
popular,'' <PERSON>Bass</PERSON> said.
   Readers who want to judge ``The Satanic Verses'' for themselves
also have been snapping up the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>, said Bass. The Strand, which
normally sells about 10 copies of the Koran a week, has sold about
200 in the last 10 days.
   Meanwhile, authors <PERSON>Norman Mailer</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Gay Talese</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>E.L. Doctorow</ORGANIZATION>,
<PERSON>Susan Sontag</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Robert Stone</ORGANIZATION> planned a public reading <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> in
<LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> of selections from ``The Satanic Verses'' and other
<PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> writings.
   Unlike the big chains, small bookstores expressed little fear of
retribution for selling ``The Satanic Verses.''
   ``I did instruct the staff to take it out of the window on
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> ... for fear of a brick being thrown,'' said <PERSON>Philip Lyman</PERSON>,
manager of the <LOCATION>Gotham</LOCATION> bookstore in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>, which has sold out.
   ``We've had no threats, but Viking had called us and told us not
to display it in our window,'' said the Coliseum employee.
   ``We've had some complaints, with people threatening to boycott
the store,'' but no threats of violence, said <PERSON>Matt Miller</PERSON>, manager
of the Tattered Cover in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>.
   ``There is a question of safety, obviously, especially on the
<LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Kevin Morrisey</PERSON>, an employee at the <ORGANIZATION>St. Paul</ORGANIZATION>
bookstore. ``But we haven't had any threats. If there are any
fundamentalist Muslims in this area, I'm not aware of them.''
   ``Nah,'' said <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> when asked if he feared Moslem retribution.
``In <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>?''

   A bookstore chain caught up in the controversy of ``The Satanic
Verses'' went on the offensive <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, with writers and
booksellers decrying death threats against its author and Islamic
groups seeking compassion for their faith.
   ``Let's not be stampeded by this kind of intellectual terrorism.
Let's vote with our wallets. Buy the book,'' said poet and novelist
<PERSON>Michael Anania</PERSON> at a rally at the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Public Library's Cultural
Center</ORGANIZATION>.
   Writers nationwide have rallied in support of <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>,
whose novel has enraged Moslems and brought a death sentence from
<LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini</PERSON> and offers of a <MONEY>$5.2 million</MONEY>
bounty.
   Moslem leaders in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, while denouncing the death
sentence and threats of violence against bookstores, said the book
was intolerable to followers of Islam and called for withdrawal of
``this slanderous work.''
   ``We simply expect the media to accord Muslims the same rights
that have been generally extended to other religious minorities,''
said <PERSON>Ahmad Zaki Hammad</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Islamic Society of North
America</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Plainfield</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ind.</LOCATION> ``It is regrettable that <ORGANIZATION>Viking Penquin
Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the (<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>) publishers, has shown insensitivity to the concerns
of Muslims.''
   Three <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> bookstore chains had yanked the book off shelves, but
<PERSON>B. Dalton</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Barnes &amp; Noble</ORGANIZATION> bookstores, which are under common
ownership, decided <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to stock the book.
   The third chain, Waldenbooks, the nation's largest with 1,200
stores, placed full-page advertisements in <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s editions of <ORGANIZATION>The
New York Times</ORGANIZATION> and eight other newspapers, saying it will continue
to sell the book despite ``many threats of violence.''
   In the text of the ad, Waldenbooks complained that it was
subjected to ``unfair castigation'' for telling its outlets to
remove the book from their shelves for security reasons.
   Waldenbooks noted that it continued to sell the book while not
displaying it until its supply ran out. Also, late last week it gave
store managers permission to display the book at their discretion.
   ``We will continue to sell the book when it comes back in stock
at the publisher,'' <PERSON>Waldenbooks</PERSON> said. ``We will continue to use
discretion in displaying the book.''
   The chain's president, <PERSON>Harry Hoffman</PERSON>, has said it has received
about 60 bomb threats.
   The Times reported in <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s editions that demand for ``The
Satanic Verses'' has been strong among independent booksellers, who
report taking orders for nearly 200,000 copies of the book.
   Yet all of the more than 300 independent booksellers surveyed by
the <ORGANIZATION>Times</ORGANIZATION> said they did not have copies of the book for sale.
   Protests also came from groups in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   ``The ayatollah hasn't only taken out a contract on <PERSON>Salman
Rushdie</PERSON>: he has taken out a contract on our American freedoms to
read, to write, and to express ourselves as we choose,'' said <PERSON>Arthur
J. Kropp</PERSON>, president of People for the <ORGANIZATION>American Way</ORGANIZATION>. The
275,000-member organization has opposed efforts by American
fundamentalists to censor textbook and school reading lists.
   An ad hoc group calling itself the <ORGANIZATION>International Committee for
Free Expression</ORGANIZATION> also issued a statement in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> decrying
<LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s threats against the British author.
   ``We can not and will not tolerate a threat to assassinate a
writer for his ideas or others for disseminating those ideas,''
declared the committee, which includes the <ORGANIZATION>American Library
Association</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>American Booksellers Association</ORGANIZATION>.
   At the <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> rally, 300 writers and supporters heard Pulitzer
Prize-winning author <PERSON>Studs Terkel</PERSON> compare <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> to <PERSON>John Scopes</PERSON>,
who was tried for teaching Darwinism, and author <PERSON>John Steinbeck</PERSON>,
criticized for his ``Grapes of Wrath.''
   Rushdie, a British citizen born in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> into a Moslem family,
went into hiding in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> because of the death threats.
   The president of <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Muslim Community Center</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mohammed
Kaiseruddin</PERSON>, said after the writers' speeches that he objects to the
death sentence, but doesn't believe such ``very strong, profane
passages about people Moslems respect the most'' should be tolerated
by society.
   A writer in <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> was organizing a public reading of <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s
work for <DATE>March 9</DATE>, the day he was supposed to give a reading during a
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> promotional tour that was canceled.
   At a public reading <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> at <ORGANIZATION>Ohio University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Athens</LOCATION>,
those who read the passages said their intent was not to offend
Islam but to protest censorship.
   ``We are here to confirm our right as Americans to read whatever
we want,'' said graduate student <PERSON>Ed Allen</PERSON>.

BOOKENDS: SLOW, STEADY KOONTZ IS SUDDENLY ON TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that he's made it to the top of the nation's premiere best seller list, 
<PERSON>Dean R. Koontz</PERSON> can think about retiring his reputation for being "the 
least-known best-selling author in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
On <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <PERSON>Koontz</PERSON>'s new novel, "Midnight," soared to the No. 1 spot on the <ORGANIZATION>New 
York Times</ORGANIZATION> best seller list. The mainstream thriller had entered the list only 
the week before -- and that was based on just 3 days of sales. 
</P>
<P>
"We were astonished," said <PERSON>Koontz</PERSON>, 43, who lives with his wife, <PERSON>Gerda</PERSON>, in the 
hills east of Orange. "I've been jumping up and down so much my ankle joints 
are beginning to give out, but it's a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
"Midnight" has also hit the No. 1 spots on the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> Times and 
Publisher's Weekly best seller lists and, according to <PERSON>Koontz</PERSON>, just about every 
other list in the country. The highest position <PERSON>Koontz</PERSON> had ever reached on the 
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Times list came in <DATE>1988</DATE> when his thriller "Lightning" rose to No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Koontz</PERSON> said his phone hasn't stopped ringing since <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> hit 
the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like I've heard from everyone I ever worked with in publishing all 
these years," said <PERSON>Koontz</PERSON>, who began publishing in <DATE>1969</DATE>. "When someone has been 
around a long time and makes it to this degree, it seems to please people in 
the industry because current wisdom is that you have to make it quick and fast 
with a lot of hype. Making it slow by writing better books and improving your 
skills over a lot of years is an old-fashioned approach and it gives editors 
who love books the feeling that the book itself actually matters, not just the 
hype." 
</P>
<P>
As has been his policy in the past, <PERSON>Koontz</PERSON> said he has been avoiding doing 
publicity for "Midnight." 
</P>
<P>
"I told Putnam I couldn't do anything for this book because I'm desperately 
trying to finish the next one. I have no time for it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, despite his best seller status since <DATE>1981</DATE>, the author of "Whispers" 
and "Strangers" has never done an author tour and has largely avoided the 
national media, particularly television, to promote his books. 
</P>
<P>
"No. 1, I'm always working on something else, and that's more exciting to me 
than going out and pitching books," he said, adding that he'd also like to 
retain as much anonymity as possible. A writer, he said, "is an observer, and 
if you're aware of other people watching you, it's harder to watch them." 
</P>
<P>
The best-selling "master of menace" is, after all, one low-key kind of guy. 
</P>
<P>
The day he and <PERSON>Gerda</PERSON> heard "Midnight" had gone to top of the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> 
best seller list, <PERSON>Koontz</PERSON> decided to celebrate by doing something 
"self-indulgent" and going out for a celebratory dinner afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"All I ended up buying was a sport coat," he said with a laugh. "And we went 
out and had salad for dinner. We're going to have to work real hard on being 
self-indulgent and celebrating." 
</P>
<P>
Mystery Writer: <PERSON>Elizabeth George</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Huntington Beach</LOCATION> said she was thrilled to 
learn last week that her <DATE>1988</DATE> British detective novel, "A Great Deliverance," 
has been nominated by Mystery Writers of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> for its "best first novel" 
award. The novel, published by <ORGANIZATION>Bantam Books</ORGANIZATION>, was among five books nominated 
nationally. The winner will be announced at an awards dinner in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> on <DATE>May 
11</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Opera Star: Dame <PERSON>Joan Sutherland</PERSON> will sign copies of her record albums at 
<ORGANIZATION>Rizzoli</ORGANIZATION>'s Book Store in <LOCATION>South Coast Plaza</LOCATION> from 2 to <TIME>3 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. <PERSON>Sutherland</PERSON>, 
who is appearing in <LOCATION>Opera Pacific</LOCATION>'s production of "Norma" at the <ORGANIZATION>Orange County 
Performing Arts Center</ORGANIZATION>, will be accompanied by her husband, maestro <PERSON>Richard 
Bonynge</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Readers Theater: <ORGANIZATION>Steve Mellow</ORGANIZATION>'s Readers' Theater will be presented at <TIME>3 p.m.</TIME> 
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>Elan Gallery</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Laguna Beach</LOCATION>, <DATE>1145</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>S. Coast Highway</ORGANIZATION>. In the 
spirit of the opening of a new one-man exhibition by French satirist <PERSON>Francis 
Meyrier</PERSON>, the readings will be from French and English satirical writings.

   NEW YORK -- Bookstores report that Kitty Kelley's
unflattering biography of Nancy Reagan is outselling every
best seller in memory, fueled by a media blitz tightly
controlled by publisher Simon &amp; Schuster.
   Simon &amp; Schuster, a unit of Paramount Communications Inc.,
said yesterday that it has already published 775,000 copies
of "Nancy Reagan: The Unauthorized Biography," and expects to
go back to press again soon.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Waldenbooks chain, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Kmart Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, sold 3,300
copies of the <PERSON>Kitty Kelley</PERSON> book <DATE>Monday</DATE>, about 10,000 more
yesterday, and told <ORGANIZATION>Simon &amp; Schuster</ORGANIZATION> it expects to sell as
many as 40,000 copies for the week.
   "This is unprecedented for us; we sold out our entire
stock in one day," said <PERSON>David Hogue</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Baker &amp; Taylor</ORGANIZATION>, one of
the country's biggest book wholesalers. "The book is selling
all over the country, and to both bookstores and libraries."
   <ORGANIZATION>Simon &amp; Schuster</ORGANIZATION> fanned the flames of media curiosity by
withholding copies of the book until the last minute, so that
revelations like <PERSON>Mrs. Reagan</PERSON>'s alleged affair with <PERSON>Frank
Sinatra</PERSON> didn't leak out and dilute the book's news value.
   Among the book's severest critics is former President
<PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON>, who said in a statement <DATE>Monday</DATE> that many of
the incidents in the book are "patently untrue," from "the
allegation of marijuana use to marital infidelity."

<HEAD>FTC Charges Six Book Publishers with Illegal Price Discrimination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Federal Trade Commission</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> issued
complaints against six of the nation's largest book publishers for
allegedly discriminating illegally against independent bookstores by
selling books at discounted prices to major chains.
   The complaints alleged that the six publishers sell books at
lower prices to large bookstore chains, including the nation's three
largest: <ORGANIZATION>Waldenbooks Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>B. Dalton Bookseller</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Crown Books Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
   The complaints were issued against <ORGANIZATION>Harper &amp; Row Publishers Inc.</ORGANIZATION>;
<ORGANIZATION>The Hearst Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>William Morrow</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Co</ORGANIZATION>. Inc.; <ORGANIZATION>Macmillan Inc.</ORGANIZATION>;
<ORGANIZATION>The Putnam Berkley Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Random House Inc.</ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION>Simon &
Schuster Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
   The complaints charged that the publishers use pricing schedules
that charge a lower price per book on large orders. They said the
publishers also treat orders placed by bookstore chains as a single
order, even if the books are shipped separately to individual chain
outlets.
   ``The chain stores therefore allegedly pay lower prices than
independent bookstores that receive shipments as large as or larger
than the shipments to individual chain outlets,'' the <ORGANIZATION>FTC</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The higher prices paid by independent stores have hurt them
financially, limiting their ability to complete with the bookstore
chains for sales to consumers and retail locations, the complaints
said.
   In response, <ORGANIZATION>Simon &amp; Schuster</ORGANIZATION> said in a statement: ``Our pricing
practices have always been fair and have resulted in providing the
consumer with the broadest range of books at the lowest possible
price. The <ORGANIZATION>FTC</ORGANIZATION> is going to have a real fight on its hands.''
   <PERSON>William T. Loverd</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the company had
not seen the complaint and could not comment on specifics. But he
said the company has been cooperating with an <ORGANIZATION>FTC</ORGANIZATION> investigation of
pricing practices of publishers and ``we are convinced that our
pricing of books is both lawful and fair.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Harper &amp; Row</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Barbara Hufham</PERSON> said her company also
cooperated with the <ORGANIZATION>FTC</ORGANIZATION>'s eight-year investigation. ``We are
convinced our trade practices are entirely proper,'' she said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>FTC</ORGANIZATION> voted 3-1 with one abstension to issue the complaints,
which begins a proceeding in which a formal hearing will be held. If
the allegations are upheld, the <ORGANIZATION>FTC</ORGANIZATION> could order the publishers to
stop the pricing practices.
   <ORGANIZATION>FTC</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Daniel Oliver</PERSON> said in a dissenting statement that
the practices did not appear to violate antitrust law and probably
have not hampered competition.
   Additionally, he said, most of the price differences probably are
justified by differences in the cost of selling to different buyers,
and the publishers cited probably are responding to competition from
other publishers.

<HL> 'Trump' Paperback Bid From Warner Tops $500,000 </HL>

   <ORGANIZATION>Warner Books</ORGANIZATION> will pay more than <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> for the paperback rights to the best-selling "Trump: The Art of the Deal." 

   Final terms are still being discussed. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Warner Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, outbid three other publishing companies for the book, written by <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> real estate developer. 
With 700,000 hardcover copies in print, the book has topped the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Times best-seller list for the past three weeks. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> editors had privately expressed concern that the book's popularity in hardcover might have saturated its market, and damped enthusiasm for the paperback rights. 
However, industry observers said the price for the paperback rights indicates <ORGANIZATION>Warner Books</ORGANIZATION> has high expectations for it. 

   Paperback rights for nonfiction bestsellers have ranged recently from <MONEY>$400,000</MONEY> to about <MONEY>$1.2 million</MONEY>. 
Authors typically get at least half the proceeds from the sale of such rights. 
<PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> has said he will donate all book proceeds -- including his share of the paperback rights -- to charity. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> said its first printing will be a least one million copies and perhaps as high as two million. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> had taken a so-called floor position of <MONEY>$350,000</MONEY> on the book; <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> had thus guaranteed <ORGANIZATION>Random House Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, publisher of the hardcover, at least that much for the paperback rights. 
In return, <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> had the right to top by <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> the highest bid from any other publishing concern. 
Bantam Books was the second highest bidder. 

   <PERSON>Laurence Kirshbaum</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Warner Books</ORGANIZATION>, said the company recognized the sales potential of "Trump" at a <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> sales conference in <LOCATION>Palm Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, in early <DATE>December</DATE>. 
"Everyone from <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> was talking about just one book -- 'Trump,'" he said. 
"So we cornered the subsidiary rights director at the swimming pool and said we want the floor. 
We didn't sit there and play with our numbers. 
We jumped on it." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Kirshbaum</PERSON> added: "I think our competitors undervalued the '<ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION>' book. 
But that's their problem."

ON HOT CAPITAL SCENE, WHO STILL SIZZLES? NANCY REAGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Trying out her new persona as author, former First Lady <PERSON>Nancy Reagan</PERSON> returned 
to the capital over the <DATE>weekend</DATE> for the first time since her husband left 
office in <DATE>January</DATE> and promptly proved to be the town's hottest celebrity 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Book sellers and book publishers, who normally are relatively star-jaded, 
flocked to a reception at the <ORGANIZATION>Library of Congress</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, hoping for a 
glimpse of <PERSON>Mrs. Reagan</PERSON>, or better yet, one of her notoriously genteel 
handshakes. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION>, which in <DATE>October</DATE> will publish <PERSON>Mrs. Reagan</PERSON>'s 
memoir, "My Turn," said 615 people sent replies for this most-coveted party of 
the four-day, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> convention of the <ORGANIZATION>American Booksellers Assn</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
But closer to 900 people queued up for a receiving line that snaked around the 
Library's majestic mezzanine level. A caterer, frantically trying to keep 
tables filled with grilled eggplant and tiny rolls stuffed with Peking duck, 
said the crowd was eating as if it were twice that number. 
</P>
<P>
While <PERSON>Mrs. Reagan</PERSON> dutifully pumped hands and exchanged cheery small talk, her 
co-author, <PERSON>Bill Novak</PERSON>, described the travails of collaborating with a "very, 
very private lady" like <PERSON>Nancy Reagan</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Nancy Reagan</PERSON> is a person who is used to being very private, and who worked 
very hard to be as candid as possible in this book," said <PERSON>Novak</PERSON>, who has been 
the co-author of books with former <ORGANIZATION>House Speaker Tip O'Neill</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> Chairman 
<PERSON>Lee Iacocca</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mayflower Madam Sydney Biddle Barrows</PERSON>, among others. Novak 
refused to compare <PERSON>Mrs. Reagan</PERSON> with any of his earlier subjects, demurring: 
"Each one is difficult in their own way. Each person is their own universe." 
</P>
<P>
Nor would he discuss his own political leanings or his views about the Reagans 
before he began this project. 
</P>
<P>
When <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> Publisher <PERSON>Joni Evans</PERSON> first telephoned to propose that he take 
on the book, <PERSON>Novak</PERSON> said he checked with his wife, <PERSON>Linda</PERSON>, to see how she felt 
about it. "She didn't miss a beat," <PERSON>Novak</PERSON> said. "She said, 'Just say yes.' " 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Novak</PERSON> said that "roughly a year ago," he began meeting regularly with <PERSON>Mrs. 
Reagan</PERSON>, traveling to the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> as often as once a week to conduct 
interviews with her and the President. But he added that much of the material 
came also from the extensive diaries <PERSON>Mrs. Reagan</PERSON> kept during her years in the 
<ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The book contains no "overriding shocker," <PERSON>Novak</PERSON> said, "so much as intimate 
details of what it is like to live in the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he promised that "My Turn" would be "a very emotionally rich 
book" with surprises about <PERSON>Mrs. Reagan</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> tenure, as well as her 
relationships with her family and others in her immediate circle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Generous First-Run Printing 
</P>
<P>
For <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION>, the surprises are expected to translate into big sales. The 
publisher has scheduled a 350,000-copy first-run printing of "My Turn," a 
figure considered generous by industry standards. 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Mrs. Reagan</PERSON>'s maiden literary effort was only one of a score of "highly 
commercial" fall titles that some publishing officials felt accounted for the 
record crowd at this year's <ORGANIZATION>ABA</ORGANIZATION> convention. 
</P>
<P>
Her fellow big-draw authors for the fall included names such as <PERSON>Erma Bombeck</PERSON>, 
<PERSON>Stephen King</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Danielle Steel</ORGANIZATION> -- as well as former Atty. Gen. <PERSON>Edwin Meese 
III</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Robert H. Bork</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> justice manque. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, why else would you go into the <ORGANIZATION>Administration</ORGANIZATION> except to sell the rights 
when you get out?" columnist Art <PERSON>Buchwald</PERSON> wondered. 
</P>
<P>
In the opinion of longtime <PERSON>Washington-watcher Buchwald</PERSON>, "The Administration is 
only a step toward getting a good literary agent." 
</P>
<P>
With his own book, "Whose Rose Garden Is It, Anyway?" scheduled for fall 
publication by Putnam's, <PERSON>Buchwald</PERSON> playfully lauded the "packaging" of <PERSON>Ronald 
Reagan</PERSON>, now at work on two books about his Presidency. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you realize what a fortune Abe Lincoln could have made?" Buchwald asked. 
"Or <PERSON>Ulysses S. Grant</PERSON>?" Grant, known for his fondness for the grape, "could have 
gone to the <PERSON>Betty Ford Clinic</PERSON>," <PERSON>Buchwald</PERSON> suggested, "and then written about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jim Wright</PERSON>'s Misfortune 
</P>
<P>
As for the misfortunes of another recent <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> author, outgoing <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> 
Speaker <PERSON>Jim Wright</PERSON>, <PERSON>Buchwald</PERSON> offered an easy explanation for the troubles that 
forced <PERSON>Wright</PERSON> to step down from his job. Wright only had problems, <PERSON>Buchwald</PERSON> 
said, "because he was selling wholesale." 
</P>
<P>
At the book sessions, a crowd the size of many small cities roamed a Convention 
Center designed to accommodate, at best, a tiny village. When the air 
conditioning gave out midway through the first day, the atmosphere turned 
particularly oppressive. <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s infamous <DATE>summer</DATE> came early this year, and 
the sticky, 90-plus-degree temperatures outside seemed rapidly to find their 
way inside. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just like the subway," said <PERSON>Dan Weiler</PERSON>, a media consultant in <LOCATION>New 
York</LOCATION>. "Only the subway is cooler." 
</P>
<P>
Initial estimates placed the count at 20,000 book sellers, publishers, authors, 
literary agents and others connected with the industry. 
</P>
<P>
But working her way through a bruising mob that bore eerie resemblance to a 
fire sale at <ORGANIZATION>Tiffany's</ORGANIZATION>, one <ORGANIZATION>ABA</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said the weekend's daily attendance 
was probably closer to 25,000. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time at an <ORGANIZATION>ABA</ORGANIZATION> convention, every one had to work his way through 
a metal detector to enter the meeting area. The heightened security was a 
response to death threats by Muslim fundamentalists against <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>, 
author of the best-selling "Satanic Verses," and anyone associated with its 
publication or sale. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'So Many Lunatics Out There' 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind the security one bit. I really like it," said <PERSON>Lori Ames</PERSON>, working 
at the <PERSON>William Morrow</PERSON> booth, just across the aisle from the Penguin display 
space. Penguin, the paperback imprint of Viking, <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s hardcover publisher, 
was among those targeted for threats when the book first came out. "You just 
never know," <PERSON>Ames</PERSON> said. "There are so many lunatics out there." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Stuart Applebaum</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Bantam</ORGANIZATION> vice president, characteristically found a humorous 
side to the increased security. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, you just have book sellers sniffing out what the bombs will be," 
<PERSON>Applebaum</PERSON> deadpanned. "This time, you have book sellers and trained guard 
dogs." 
</P>
<P>
Conspicuously absent at this year's <ORGANIZATION>ABA</ORGANIZATION> were the two-person dogs and dancing 
bears that have clogged the halls at earlier conventions. Handouts were 
abandoned, as always, but hype was at a decided minimum. Only one adult in a 
gorilla suit was spotted, and even Spiderman was unaccompanied by any of his 
other comic book cohorts. 
</P>
<P>
"It just seemed that people were rushing around with their noses to the 
grindstone," said <PERSON>Martha Jackson</PERSON> of A Clean, Well Lighted Place for Books in 
<LOCATION>Larkspur</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION> "I think people are working hard." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
500 Uninvited Guests 
</P>
<P>
But after hours, they also were partying hard. Book people may like to read, 
but it also turns out that they love to have fun. Almost 500 uninvited guests 
showed up at <LOCATION>Houghton Mifflin</LOCATION>'s party at the <ORGANIZATION>Phillips Collection</ORGANIZATION>, for example, 
making vice president <PERSON>Marly Russoff</PERSON> feel "like I was conducting the invasion at 
<LOCATION>Normandy</LOCATION>" as she warded off crashers at the staid old museum. It looked "like a 
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> nightclub on <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, everyone lined up and getting in two by 
two," <PERSON>Russoff</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Russoff</PERSON>, too, took the enthusiastic masses as a positive sign for the 
publishing industry. "Business is good, for one thing," she said. "Bookstores 
are selling books. Sales are up, and we're publishing more aggressively than 
ever." 
</P>
<P>
Even as they pushed their way through the throng to inspect displays of new 
books or products, convention goers seemed eager and upbeat, Russoff observed, 
adding: "There's a great sense of optimism this year."

<P>
When bookseller <PERSON>Ed Thomas</PERSON> received a phone call from best-selling author <PERSON>Dean 
Koontz</PERSON> of Orange last fall inviting him and his wife, <PERSON>Pat</PERSON>, out for dinner that 
night, <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> should have been tipped off that something was up. 
</P>
<P>
The <PERSON>Thomases</PERSON>, who own Book <ORGANIZATION>Carnival</ORGANIZATION> in Orange, had become good friends with 
<PERSON>Koontz</PERSON> over the years and they frequently go out to dinner with him and his 
wife, <PERSON>Gerda</PERSON>. But <PERSON>Koontz</PERSON>, the prolific thriller writer dubbed "the Master of 
Menace," is not one to do things on the spur of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
At dinner, <PERSON>Koontz</PERSON> presented the <PERSON>Thomases</PERSON> with an advance galley proof of his 
latest suspense thriller, "Midnight," which he had autographed. After <PERSON>Pat 
Thomas</PERSON> read the inscription, <PERSON>Koontz</PERSON> told her to look above the inscription, at 
the dedication: 
</P>
<P>
"To Ed and <PERSON>Pat Thomas</PERSON> of the Book <ORGANIZATION>Carnival</ORGANIZATION> who are such nice people that 
sometimes I suspect they're not really human but aliens from another, better 
world." 
</P>
<P>
"I was shocked and elated," said <PERSON>Ed Thomas</PERSON>. "There's something about seeing 
your name in a book. Within a few minutes you start realizing your name is 
going to be in every copy of the book that's published. It boggles your mind, 
and especially with the way Dean is selling, I figure there's going to be a lot 
of copies of the book sold." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it looks as though <PERSON>Koontz</PERSON> may have another best-seller on his hands. 
</P>
<P>
Book <ORGANIZATION>Carnival</ORGANIZATION>, which is hosting an autograph party for <PERSON>Koontz</PERSON> from 1 to <TIME>4 p.m.</TIME> 
<DATE>today</DATE>, received a large shipment of books to sell at the signing. And in less 
than 2 weeks, the small mystery and science-fiction speciality bookstore at 870 
<ORGANIZATION>N. Tustin Ave.</ORGANIZATION> had already sold 102 copies of "Midnight." 
</P>
<P>
If past <PERSON>Koontz</PERSON> book signings at Book <ORGANIZATION>Carnival</ORGANIZATION> are any indication, his fans can 
count on a long wait in line today. 
</P>
<P>
Koontz, in fact, holds the shop record. When he did a signing at the store last 
fall for his new children's book, "Oddkins," he began autographing books at 1 
in the <TIME>afternoon</TIME> and, because the line was so long, he didn't finish until 
7:15. In fact, he returned the next day and signed for another 6 hours. In all, 
<PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> sold 500 copies of "Oddkins." 
</P>
<P>
Lest <PERSON>Koontz</PERSON>'s fans be bored in line this time around, a magician had been hired 
to keep the crowd entertained. 
</P>
<P>
As for the dedication to the <PERSON>Thomases</PERSON>, <PERSON>Koontz</PERSON> said he normally dedicates his 
books to friends. With a laugh, he said this is the first time that he has 
dedicated a book to friends who also happen to be booksellers. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife," he noted, "has received more dedications than anyone, not because 
she's my wife, but because she is my best friend." 
</P>
<P>
Book Signing: <LOCATION>Anaheim</LOCATION> author <PERSON>Valerie King</PERSON> will sign copies of her new Regency 
romance, "A Daring Wager," from 1 to <TIME>3 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>today</DATE> at <ORGANIZATION>Sunshine Books</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>8898 
Valley View St.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Buena Park</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Read Aloud: <PERSON>Jim Trelease</PERSON>, author of "The Read-Aloud Handbook," will discuss 
"reading aloud: motivating children to make books into friends, not enemies" at 
<TIME>7:30 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Monday</DATE> in the main auditorium at the <ORGANIZATION>First Christian Church of 
Huntington Beach</ORGANIZATION>, 1207 Main St. 
</P>
<P>
The lecture, in which <ORGANIZATION>Trelease</ORGANIZATION> will also discuss the influences of excessive 
television viewing, is being sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION>Huntington Beach Public Library</ORGANIZATION> 
and the Friends of the <ORGANIZATION>Children's Library</ORGANIZATION>. Tickets are <MONEY>$2</MONEY> per person and should 
be purchased in advance from the library. Information: (714) 848-7813. 
</P>
<P>
Author Festival: More than 40 authors and illustrators of children's 
literature, who will be speaking at schools in the <LOCATION>Huntington Beach</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Ocean 
View School</ORGANIZATION> districts during the day, will gather at the <ORGANIZATION>Huntington Beach 
Central Library</ORGANIZATION> from 3 to <TIME>4:30 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Thursday</DATE> to meet their fans and sign 
autographs. 
</P>
<P>
Among those scheduled to appear are <PERSON>John Archambault</PERSON> ("Knots on a Counting 
Rope"), <PERSON>John Reynolds Gardiner</PERSON> ("Stone Fox"), <PERSON>Patsy Garrett</PERSON> ("A Walk with <PERSON>Mr. 
Peeps</PERSON>") and <PERSON>Adrienne Jones</PERSON> ("The Hawks of Chelney").

   Delay in `Gone With the Wind' Sequel Sparks Rumors

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- The sequel to "Gone With the Wind" is gone
from the new book lineup -- for now.
   The sequel to the Margaret Mitchell Civil War classic was
supposed to be the big fall book from the Warner Books
division of Time Warner Inc. But Warner has quietly dropped
the book from its fall list, and it canceled a big party
scheduled to promote the sequel at the American Booksellers
Association convention in Las Vegas last week.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The delay sparked rumors in the gossipy publishing world
that the book is poorly written and needs heavy rewriting.
   <ORGANIZATION>Warner Books</ORGANIZATION> denies that the book, which has been titled
"Scarlett: the Sequel to <PERSON>Margaret Mitchell</PERSON>'s Gone With the
Wind," is in trouble. <PERSON>Laurence Kirshbaum</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Warner
Books</ORGANIZATION>, says the book is merely taking longer than planned and
"it just doesn't make sense to rush it out for <DATE>fall</DATE>. It's
only about <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> finished." He also dismisses rumors that the
sequel isn't up to par. "As one of three people who has read
what's done, I can tell you that it's excellent," he says.
   Warner was the winning bidder two years ago at an auction
of the sequel rights by the original author's estate, paying
a whopping <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY>. <PERSON>Mr. Kirshbaum</PERSON> says the company won't
pay the full amount until it accepts the final manuscript,
which is being written by romance novelist <PERSON>Alexandra Ripley</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Ms. Ripley</PERSON> was selected by the executors of the <PERSON>Mitchell</PERSON>
estate to write the sequel.
   "Gone With The Wind" ranks as one of the best-selling
books of all time, with more than 25 million copies sold
since its publication in <DATE>1936</DATE>. Anticipation of the sequel is
high and so are the stakes for <ORGANIZATION>Warner Books</ORGANIZATION>, which must sell
more than 250,000 copies in hardcover to make a profit.
Warner already sold book club rights to the <ORGANIZATION>Literary Guild</ORGANIZATION>, a
unit of <ORGANIZATION>Bertelsmann AG</ORGANIZATION> for a sum that industry executives
estimate is more than <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY>.
   "Even if the manuscript is in real trouble, I'm sure
<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> won't talk about it," says <PERSON>Howard Kaminsky</PERSON>, chairman
of <ORGANIZATION>Hearst Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Trade Book Group</ORGANIZATION>. "It's such a big
investment, and they'll want to put the best face on it.
Everybody knows that for the first two weeks it comes out, it
will sell just on curiosity, but word of mouth will have to
carry it from there."
   <PERSON>Ms. Ripley</PERSON>, the author, doesn't have time to discuss her
project, because "she's hard at work," says her agent, <PERSON>Robert
Gottlieb</PERSON> of <PERSON>William Morris</PERSON>. But <PERSON>Mr. Gottlieb</PERSON> says <PERSON>Ms. Ripley</PERSON>
has written "about 1,000 pages" and it's taking so long
because "she wants it to be historically pure. She's been
looking at archives -- letters and newspapers from the
period." Asked about rumors that the plot involves <PERSON>Scarlett
O'Hara</PERSON> having a baby and moving to <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>, where <PERSON>Rhett
Butler</PERSON> is running guns, <PERSON>Mr. Gottlieb</PERSON> replied: "I can't get
into a discussion about what's in the book, but part of what
you said is accurate."
   A lawyer representing the <PERSON>Mitchell</PERSON> estate in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Paul
Anderson</PERSON>, said: "It's my understanding that the book has been
delayed, but I fully expect it to be published. It's a
staggering undertaking, so it wouldn't be surprising if there
were some delays."
   <PERSON>Mr. Anderson</PERSON> said the estate hasn't seen the manuscript
and doesn't have final approval of what is written.
   Asked whether he's worried about "Scarlett" getting bad
reviews or fizzling out after initial sales, <PERSON>Mr. Gottlieb</PERSON>,
the agent, seems unconcerned. Even if the book is less than
wonderful, he avows, "it will still sell a zillion copies.
I'm not worried about the future: I want the book to do well
when it's published."
   And what about the devout fans of "Gone with the Wind"?
<PERSON>Carolyn Roderick</PERSON>, a librarian in <LOCATION>Pine Knoll Shores</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>,
says she read one of <PERSON>Ms. Ripley</PERSON>'s earlier novels as soon as
she heard about the sequel. "I was very disappointed. I
couldn't finish the book, to be honest, and I'd just as soon
she didn't {write the sequel}," she says.
   But will she buy the book, even if it gets lousy reviews?
"Good, bad or indifferent, I'm sure I couldn't resist buying
it," says <PERSON>Ms. Roderick</PERSON>. "But I'll probably wait till it comes
out in paperback."
   <PERSON>Mr. Kirshbaum</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Warner Books</ORGANIZATION> says he is now hoping to
publish "Scarlett" in hardcover next <DATE>spring</DATE>, "in time for
Mother's Day," and he thinks that will work out just fine.
"As Scarlett would say," adds <PERSON>Mr. Kirshbaum</PERSON>, " `Next season
is another season.'"

THE MASS-MARKETING OF JEAN AUEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Browsers in 4,000 American bookstores these last few weeks may have mistaken 
the satin, six-foot-long banners that say "IT'S COMING!" for the announcement 
of a major religious phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, <PERSON>Jean M. Auel</PERSON>'s millions of fans might very well view the 
publication of "The Plains of Passage," the latest in <PERSON>Auel</PERSON>'s "Earth's Children" 
series, as a spiritual event of its own. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a devout following," said <PERSON>Andrew K. Martin</PERSON>, vice president and director 
of publicity at <LOCATION>Crown</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Auel</PERSON>'s hardcover publisher. "It's not a cult, exactly, 
but it's just huge, and it's intense. Jean is so loved by her readers." 
</P>
<P>
Auel's fans are so devoted, in fact, that they regularly name children after 
<PERSON>Ayla</PERSON>, her Ice Age heroine, and are so persistent that they've called <PERSON>Martin</PERSON>'s 
office day in and day out for years asking for progress reports on the new 
book. Finally, <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> was forced to take refuge in a form letter that said, 
"Dear Reader, Thank you for your inquiry regarding the fourth novel in the 
celebrated 'Earth's Children' saga. As of this date, author <PERSON>Jean M. Auel</PERSON> is 
still at work. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The success of <ORGANIZATION>Auel</ORGANIZATION>'s previous three novels combined with this intense level of 
interest surrounding "The Plains of Passage" prompted Crown to schedule a 
massive 1.3-million first-run hardcover printing. "There probably have never 
been higher expectations for a novel," said <PERSON>Chip Gibson</PERSON>, Crown's associate 
publisher and marketing vice president. Echoing this optimism, <PERSON>Stuart 
Applebaum</PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Bantam</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Auel</PERSON>'s paperback publisher, called "The 
Plains of Passage" "perhaps the most anticipated popular novel in the last five 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Crown's "major six-figure" marketing campaign resembles a crusade. Martin, 
<PERSON>Gibson</PERSON> and others at Crown "sat around to hash out" a marketing drive that 
would run on "two or three phases," <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said. <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said the strategy, 
planned with military precision, is "all geared to answer that question that 
has been going on for five years -- 'When is the next <PERSON>Jean M. Auel</PERSON>?' It's 
saying, 'Get ready, folks, it's here.' " 
</P>
<P>
First, the "IT'S COMING!" banners went up in stores in <DATE>mid-September</DATE>. On <DATE>Oct</DATE>. 
3, when "The Plains of Passage" arrived in bookstores, they were replaced by 
satin banners of the same proportions that said "IT'S HERE!" For Phase Two, 
along with full-page advertisements in most major newspapers. Crown has teamed 
with <LOCATION>Bantam</LOCATION> to create a floor display with <PERSON>Auel</PERSON>'s three previous books. 
</P>
<P>
"They will be selling in hardcover right alongside the Bantam paperback," 
<PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the third phase will spotlight <PERSON>Auel</PERSON>, the author who never wrote a word 
before she was 40, and who turned down a top-paying job with a bank to become 
what <ORGANIZATION>Newsweek</ORGANIZATION> once called "the late-Pleistocene <PERSON>Harold Robbins</PERSON>." <PERSON>Auel</PERSON>, 54, will 
tour for a month-and-a-half, autographing books in two stores per city. In 
addition, Crown plans a 30-city satellite tour. 
</P>
<P>
"We really started out trying to keep it down," <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said of the author's 
publicity expedition. 
</P>
<P>
Auel is not the only author, of course, who has a fanatical following. <PERSON>Carol 
Schneider</PERSON>, vice president for publicity for <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION>, says fans of <PERSON>James 
Michener</PERSON> and <PERSON>Robert Ludlum</PERSON> are prone to call and say, "My father's in the 
hospital dying. Couldn't you just get it to me ahead of time so he can read it 
before he goes?" 
</P>
<P>
And sizeable publicity blitzes have also been seen with best-selling authors 
such as <PERSON>Tom Clancy</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Danielle Steel</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Stephen King</PERSON>. Along with <PERSON>Auel</PERSON>, said <PERSON>Greg 
Mowry</PERSON>, associate publicity director at <PERSON>William Morrow</PERSON>, "those seem to be the 
four authors who are impervious to changes in the marketplace. They're the ones 
you can go to the bank on." 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Clancy</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>King and Steel</ORGANIZATION>, who publish books on an almost yearly schedule, are 
less likely to hit the interview trail, and are almost certain not to be seen 
signing books twice a day for a month-and-a-half. By contrast, the publicity 
drive designed for <ORGANIZATION>Auel</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mowry</PERSON> said, is "what I call a typical, glitzy 
mass-market paperback approach to a hardback." 
</P>
<P>
In the <PERSON>Auel</PERSON> offensive, "You're seeing the mass-marketization of hardcover," 
<PERSON>Mowry</PERSON> said. "It's totally mass-market. It's a campaign designed to reach the 
widest audience." 
</P>
<P>
The mass-market approach makes sense, said <PERSON>Applebaum</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Bantam</LOCATION>, because "Jean 
is selling hardcovers in mass-market quantities. Therefore, the techniques that 
her publishers are putting forward are appropriate to the consumer demand." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, said <PERSON>Mary Ann Palumbo</PERSON>, the vice president for advertising, 
promotion and publicity at <ORGANIZATION>NAL</ORGANIZATION>, "I think more and more hardcover houses are 
doing things that paperback publishers do." Palumbo was responsible for what 
<PERSON>Greg Mowry</PERSON> called the "fabulous launch" in paperback of <PERSON>Ken Follett</PERSON>'s "The 
Pillars of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of <ORGANIZATION>Auel</ORGANIZATION>'s publicity extravaganza, <ORGANIZATION>Bantam</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Stuart Applebaum</PERSON> said, 
"to not do it would be like not crossing the street" to get to the other side. 
Logic might suggest that such an enormous promotion might not be necessary for 
an author whose readers have been calling and writing about this book for the 
<DATE>last half-decade</DATE>, but as <PERSON>Applebaum</PERSON> said, "It's not so much that it's necessary, 
it's almost a reader service in this case." 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, this kind of effort also may be a publisher's service. "Everyone 
else wants to lure these authors away," <PERSON>Morrow</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Mowry</PERSON> said. Publishers who 
stage lavish and innovative publicity programs "are protecting their 
investments." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Auel</PERSON>, <PERSON>Crown</PERSON>'s investment, is using every last minute before the cross-country 
stump begins to research her next books at the caves of <LOCATION>Lascaux</LOCATION> in southern 
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. Mother of five, grandmother of 14, <PERSON>Auel</PERSON> retains "a complete lack of 
affectation or pretension," <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"She's definitely not of the glamour set," he said. "She's a real celebrity of 
the people, of the masses." 
</P>
<P>
And "masses" is exactly the quantity of copies of "The Plains of Passage" that 
<ORGANIZATION>Martin</ORGANIZATION> expects to sell. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be incredible," <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said in a voice that was full of, yes, 
anticipation.

Do managers read? Or do they just accumulate the latest business tomes on
their bookshelves?
According to <PERSON>Bob Norton</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Head of Information Services</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>Institute of
Management</ORGANIZATION> and author of <ORGANIZATION>The Ten Commandments of Management</ORGANIZATION> (Century
Business), 'managers want to read . . . as little as possible.' So what
accounts for the proliferation of new business titles and the big push by
booksellers into the lucrative business book market?
As <PERSON>Norton</PERSON> stresses, most business books are fundamentally boring. Still,
managers want to glean the cleverest new ideas and techniques buried amidst
the tonnage. The trick is to find them, hopefully in advance of your
competitors. For that, you need help.
Fortunately, booksellers have embraced the challenge. In addition to
stocking a wide range of business and economics titles, the sales staff in
the business bookshops are generally first rate, capable of guiding the
business person through the maze of similar-sounding titles. As the table
shows, major booksellers and speciality business bookshops accept credit
card orders over the phone. They will generally deliver books in stock
within two to three days, and can order titles not in stock from the
publisher, generally within two to three weeks.
Most American business books are available in same time frame via their UK
distributor. Books published in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> which do not have a local distributor
can take six to eight weeks, although Books Etc. claims to be able to get
such books within four weeks.
For the bookseller, business books - not just on general management, but
also topics such as time-management, skill-improvement, sales and marketing
and biographies of business tycoons - offer some advantages. They are not
gifts; people buy them all year around, not just at <LOCATION>Christmas</LOCATION>. Moreover,
these books are expensive, and sold to customers who seem indifferent to
price. 'If somebody wants a book, they don't care if it's Pounds 16.99 or
Pounds 19.99,' says <PERSON>Andrew Meinke</PERSON>, at <ORGANIZATION>Dillons Business Bookshop</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
Many business book purchasers are on expense accounts; in some cases, the
books are tax deductible. UK publishers typically sell a Dollars 16.99
American business book for Pounds 16.99 (Dollars 25). So despite a short
shelf life - most businessmen want the latest book, or the most recent
edition - business books are good business.
But where to get them? The Dillons chain has developed a speciality in the
business book area. Some 40 of its shops nationwide carry a broad selection.
The flagship store is adjacent to <ORGANIZATION>London Business School</ORGANIZATION>. It has a wide
selection and does a brisk mail order business.
What makes a best-seller? According to <ORGANIZATION>Dillons</ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON>Mr Meinke</PERSON>, it all depends on
'buzzwords'. This year the key phrase is 're-engineering'. Last year it was
'networking.' Dillons top-sellers this year are <PERSON>John Kay</PERSON>'s Foundations of
Corporate Success (<ORGANIZATION>Oxford University Press</ORGANIZATION>) and Re-engineering the
Corporation by <PERSON>Michael Hammer</PERSON> and <PERSON>James Champy</PERSON> (<PERSON>Nicholas Brealey</PERSON>). 'It's
always haphazard to figure out how well a book will sell,' says <PERSON>Mr Meinke</PERSON>.
'Sometimes you make horrendous mistakes as I did this year by ordering far
too many copies of Silicon Samurai (a book on Japanese IT innovation,
<PERSON>Blackwell</PERSON>).'
In conjunction with major publishers, Dillons prints a '<ORGANIZATION>Business Book
Service</ORGANIZATION>' brochure containing brief descriptions of the latest titles. Other
specialist branches include the Dillons Barbican Business Book Centre (at
the <LOCATION>Barbican</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>) and Dillons Economist Bookshop on <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> Street,
WC2, near <ORGANIZATION>The London School of Economics</ORGANIZATION>.
Also pursuing the business books trade is the Books Etc chain. Branches in
the <LOCATION>City</LOCATION> of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> cater for bankers, accountants and lawyers. The
best-selling title at the Broadgate shop is Options, Futures, and <ORGANIZATION>Other
Derivative Securities</ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON>John Hull</PERSON> (Prentice-Hall). Books Etc. offers free
same-day delivery in the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> area. <PERSON>Portia King</PERSON>, manager of the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>
Wall shop, puts out an annual business book catalogue listing all current
and upcoming business books, with indices by title and author (next
catalogue available in <DATE>March 94</DATE>). They also have a mailing list where you
can tick areas of interest and will send you news of forthcoming titles.
The main UK specialist in business books is <LOCATION>Parks</LOCATION>, which sells finance,
accounting, and law books, primarily to corporate account customers. Parks
provides same-day hand delivery in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Manchester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Glasgow</LOCATION>, and
<LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION> for a charge of Pounds 1.50 plus VAT. It has a specialised
mailing list. Parks can get hold of anything published in the UK or <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>
but <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> is a problem. 'People come in and they want books on the German
accounting system,' says <PERSON>Mr Rob Frampton</PERSON>, manager of the Copthall Avenue
branch, 'and it's the devil's own job to get hold of these European
publishers.' So much for the single market.
<ORGANIZATION>Waterstones</ORGANIZATION> carries a broad spread of business titles in its larger
branches, such as the Leadenhall market store in the <LOCATION>City</LOCATION>. The chain does
some promotions together with publishers but has no specific service for
business books. Telephone order lines seem to be permanently engaged.
Chances are, if you can't find it elsewhere, Blackwells will have it.
Blackwells, which does some 60 per cent of its business by mail order,
stocks over 8,000 titles just in management, not counting thousands more in
international trade, economics, computing and related disciplines. The main
shop in <LOCATION>Oxford</LOCATION> has an impressive selection of business books. Blackwells
also has a mailing list and can send news of upcoming titles in your area of
interest.
Airport terminals, with thousands of business travellers (two-thirds male)
with time to kill, are a natural outlet for business booksellers. Heathrow
can probably create a best seller on its own. <PERSON>Sam Brown</PERSON>, airports book buyer
for <ORGANIZATION>W H Smith</ORGANIZATION>, which has the concession at three of the <LOCATION>Heathrow</LOCATION> terminals,
<LOCATION>Gatwick North</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Manchester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Stanstead</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION>, chooses one business
book for promotion every month. This is given floor-to-ceiling graphic
displays and four or five shelves to promote the title. Business books
account for 10 per cent of W H <PERSON>Smith</PERSON>'s turnover at <LOCATION>Heathrow</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Sam Brown</PERSON>'s
best-seller right now is <PERSON>John Harvey-Jones</PERSON>'s Making It Happen (<PERSON>Harper
Collins</PERSON>).
If you don't have time to browse through the bookshelves, you can join
Executive World, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s business book club. The club offers its 15,000
members an opportunity to buy the best selling business books at a 25 per
cent discount. The deal is the usual upfront offer (three or four books for
around Pounds 5) and then a commitment to purchase at least four in the next
8 months. Executive World puts out a bi-monthly magazine offering a
selection of 50 titles in areas such as communication, negotiation,
efficiency, small business, and general management. 'The title sells the
book,' says <PERSON>James Opie</PERSON>, who runs Executive World. Its number two best seller
is called Perfect CV by American recruitment specialist <PERSON>Tom Jackson</PERSON>.
'Everybody looks for a job at some point or another,' says <PERSON>Opie</PERSON>. 'For Pounds
7.45, after the 25 per cent discount, you can own that book.' Executive
World can be contacted on 0793-512666.
Executive Book Summaries (EBS) is the answer for those who want to keep up
with the business literature but cannot spare the time. Based in <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>EBS</ORGANIZATION> publishes synopses of business books. Nearly one-third of it subscribers
are outside <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>, including 'just about every country except <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>,'
says marketing director <PERSON>Rob Carter</PERSON>. Presumably, <ORGANIZATION>EBS</ORGANIZATION> is a brilliant idea for
non-native English speakers.
EBS reads all the business books published in English every year, working
with the publishers so they can see advance manuscripts and galleys. They
pick the 30 best books for eight-page summaries and write one-page
mini-summaries for 36 others. 'The publishers and the authors are all for
it,' says <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>. 'We act as a screening service to help our subscribers
decide 'these are the books I need to buy'. Its not a replacement, but it
whets their appetite.' EBS also sells, by mail order, the 66 titles
reviewed. An annual subscription costs Dollars 139 (Pounds 92). For more
information ring US 804-453-4062 (Fax 804-453-5062).
A number of publishers specialise in business books, including <ORGANIZATION>Oxford
University Press</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Nicholas Brealey</PERSON>, <PERSON>Gower</PERSON>, <PERSON>Addison Wesley</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Maxwell Macmillan</ORGANIZATION>
and <ORGANIZATION>McGraw-Hill</ORGANIZATION>. The publisher can do a lot to influence prospective
customers. <ORGANIZATION>McGraw Hill</ORGANIZATION>, one of the largest business book publishers, prints
more than 70 titles per year and is the European distributor for the <ORGANIZATION>Harvard
Business School</ORGANIZATION> press. Every <DATE>April</DATE> it publishes a glossy Business Magazine,
distributed free at bookshops, which features interviews with authors,
excerpts from books, and listings of forthcoming titles.
Also worth noting is Business Age magazine, which publishes one-paragraph
notes on new business books in the back of the magazine. Fortune, <ORGANIZATION>Business
Week and Management Today</ORGANIZATION> each carry a small number of reviews in each
issue. And, of course, there is always the <ORGANIZATION>Financial Times Review of
Business Books</ORGANIZATION>.

   NEW YORK -- Auction fever is hitting the publishing
industry once again, with two big-name novelists commanding
millions for books they haven't written yet.
   According to publishing executives, a division of Bantam
Doubleday Dell Publishing Group agreed this week to pay more
than $12 million in a ferociously competitive auction for two
novels by Ken Follett, author of the best sellers "Eye of the
Needle" and "The Key to Rebecca." And British novelist
Jeffrey Archer, who wrote "Kane &amp; Abel," is expected to
announce today that he will receive a total of more than $20
million for his next three books.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Word of the two transactions is sending a shock wave
through the publishing industry, where a number of companies
have been forced to write off the extravagant advances paid
to writers in past seasons. Just <DATE>last fall</DATE>, publishers vowed
that they wouldn't continue to pay huge advances to authors,
and literary agents reported that many authors were getting
lower offers than in recent years.
   "It was just wishful thinking that outrageous advances
were a thing of the past," said <PERSON>Phyllis Grann</PERSON>, president of
<ORGANIZATION>Putnam Berkley Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which publishes many best-selling
authors. "To me this is a very significant week in the
industry." Added the head of another major publisher: "This
is beyond irresponsible, beyond mathematics. This is like
throwing bundles of money out the window, and it's very
unhealthy for the industry."
   <PERSON>Carole Baron</PERSON>, president and publisher of Delacorte/Dell,
the division of <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Bertelsmann AG</ORGANIZATION> that bought the
two <PERSON>Follett</PERSON> novels, declined to confirm the <MONEY>$12 million-plus</MONEY>
figure. She said the sum paid includes rights for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and hardcover and paperback rights. "This is about
names that absolutely, positively deliver, making the
bestseller lists for both hardcover and paperback," said <PERSON>Ms.
Baron</PERSON>. "I think I made a prudent investment."
   Delacorte/Dell publishes such big names as <PERSON>Danielle Steel</PERSON>,
Belva Plain and <PERSON>Elmore Leonard</PERSON>, and it just had an unexpected
hit with a novel based on the "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"
movie that sold more than two million paperback copies. But
"we don't have anybody quite like <PERSON>Ken Follett</PERSON>," said <PERSON>Ms.
Baron</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Mr. Follett</PERSON> still has another novel to complete under a
contract to <ORGANIZATION>Hearst Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>William Morrow &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION> for hardcover
and British paperback publisher <PERSON>Penguin Books</PERSON>, both of which
dropped out of this week's auction. The <MONEY>$12 million</MONEY> "is
considerably more than we offered, but we won't know for
years who is right," said <PERSON>Peter Mayer</PERSON>, chief executive
officer of <ORGANIZATION>International Penguin Group</ORGANIZATION>, parent of Penguin
Books. "One can say that <PERSON>Ken Follett</PERSON> will have to sell a
great many more copies than he has sold in the past." By one
estimate, <PERSON>Mr. Follett</PERSON>'s next publisher will have to sell
350,000 hardcover copies and more than two million paperbacks
of each novel, just to break even.
   <PERSON>Mr. Archer</PERSON>, reached in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, said "I think it's common
knowledge there was a pre-emptive bid six or eight weeks ago
for <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY> {for two novels and a book of short stories},
which I rejected." <PERSON>Mr. Archer</PERSON> wouldn't say which publisher
had made the offer or why he rejected it, but he confirmed
that an auction of his books is scheduled to conclude today.
   <PERSON>Jack Romanos</PERSON>, president of mass market publishing for the
<ORGANIZATION>Simon &amp; Schuster</ORGANIZATION> division of <ORGANIZATION>Paramount Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION>,
said <ORGANIZATION>Simon &amp; Schuster</ORGANIZATION>, which has been <PERSON>Mr. Archer</PERSON>'s publisher
in hardcover and paperback, had an option to acquire his next
book. "But we weren't willing to come up to the level of
advance he was looking for," said <PERSON>Mr. Romanos</PERSON>. "He is similar
to <PERSON>Follett</PERSON> in that his greatest success, "<PERSON>Kane &amp; Abel</PERSON>," was
about 10 years ago. From my perspective, you've got people
willing to pay in <DATE>1990</DATE> for something that happened in <DATE>1980</DATE>."
   While these newest mega-advances are shocking the
industry, they don't break the record. Novelist <PERSON>Stephen King</PERSON>
has reportedly received advances of <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY> for his next
three books. But then, say publishing insiders, <PERSON>Mr. King</PERSON>
routinely sells more than one million copies in hardcover and
may be the only writer around who can demand that much money
and still leave his publisher with a profit.
