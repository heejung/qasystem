<TEXT>
   The world's largest dictionary of the English
language will be published five months from now and everyone who is
interested will want to have one _ if they can pick it up.
   The second edition of ``The Oxford English Dictionary'' _ known
to word buffs as the OED _ will have 22,000 pages, fill 20 volumes,
weigh 137 pounds (62.5 kg) and be priced at about <MONEY>$2,500</MONEY>.
   ``We are sure we will sell a lot because the dictionary is the
standard work of reference on the English language and any
substantial library will have to have it,'' said <PERSON>Ludo Craddock</PERSON>,
promotions executive of the <ORGANIZATION>Oxford University Press</ORGANIZATION>.
   The publishing house, founded in <DATE>1584</DATE>, describes the dictionary
as its most adventurous project since it started the first edition
in the <DATE>19th century</DATE> and completed it in <DATE>1928</DATE>.
   It has put the vocabulary of English since <DATE>1150</DATE> A.D. on a
computer, creating a data base for the language that can be
continuously updated and eventually be made accessible to any
subscriber with a home computer.
   The cost was estimated at approximately <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> when details
were first announced in <DATE>May 1984</DATE>.
   The 1,100-page first volume of the monumental work to be printed
and bound was sent to the seven-day <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> Book Fair in <LOCATION>West
Germany</LOCATION>, which opened <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   ``The first volume we got ready is actually volume two. Volume
one contains a 68-page introduction which wasn't ready in time,''
<PERSON>Craddock</PERSON> said.
   ``It's a 12-month production job just to print and bind the
first run of the dictionary,'' he said.
   The first edition of the <ORGANIZATION>OED</ORGANIZATION> had 44 million words of text and
the second has 59 million, composed from 350 million printed
characters.
   There are 290,500 main entries on different words, an increase
of <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> on the first edition.
   In addition, there are 157,000 combinations and derivatives and
169,000 phrases making a total of 616,500 ``word forms'' which are
defined. The <DATE>1928</DATE> edition had 414,825.
   The dictionary contains 2,412,400 quotations illustrating how
writers used the words and the first known use of each word.
   The OED was first published in parts between <DATE>1884</DATE> and <DATE>1928</DATE> and a
supplement of new words and words missed the first time around was
added in <DATE>1933</DATE>. Together they made up 13 volumes.
   The last of four additional volumes, including the <DATE>1933</DATE>
supplement and 69,000 modern words added to the lexicon, was
finished in <DATE>1986</DATE> by New Zealander <PERSON>Robert Burchfield</PERSON>, who took 29
years to finish it. The publishers had expected it to take seven
years.
   Since <PERSON>Burchfield</PERSON>'s four volumes, 5,000 new words have been added
_ ``most of them at the beginning of the alphabet as <PERSON>Burchfield</PERSON> was
continually adding as he progressed,'' said <PERSON>Craddock</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>James Murray</PERSON>, a Scottish village tailor's son, was the
dictionary's original editor.
   Computerizing the new <ORGANIZATION>OED</ORGANIZATION> has taken five years under the
supervision of the dictionary's co-editors, <PERSON>John Simpson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Edmund
Weiner</PERSON>. The computer science department of the <ORGANIZATION>University of
Waterloo</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, helped to devise the software and the
British arm of <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines</ORGANIZATION> provided the
hardware.
   According to <PERSON>Craddock</PERSON>, the new OED is ``more than five times the
size of any other dictionary of the English language.''

   Heavy readers take heart. The long-awaited second
edition of ``The Oxford English Dictionary'' will weigh in at a
whopping 137 pounds worth of words.
   The venerable OED, world's biggest dictionary, is getting bigger.
   ``We are sure we will sell a lot because the dictionary is the

   The publishing house, founded in <DATE>1584</DATE>, describes the dictionary
as its most adventurous project since it began the first edition in

   But the first edition had a mere 44 million words of text and

worked in a garden shed from slips of paper. He died in <DATE>1915</DATE> when
he was halfway through the letter `S.'
   The new edition also has been computerized, with the vocabulary
of English since <DATE>1150</DATE> A.D. on a single data base to be available by
home computer.
   The first advertisements for the dictionary are now appearing in
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. The publishers are reluctant to
divulge any other details about the dictionary before it is
officially launched on <DATE>March 29</DATE>.
   But this book is big. According to <PERSON>Craddock</PERSON>, the new OED is
``more than five times the size of any other dictionary of the

<TEXT>
IMAGES OF ENGLISH by <PERSON>Richard W. Bailey Cambridge</PERSON> Pounds 16.95, 329 pages
I ONCE saw a notice in a <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> bus explaining scheduling changes which
concluded with the words, 'So the buses run smoother, and there are less
delays'. To purists this sentence is a ghastly example of the
quasi-illiteracy which besets our culture. To the more liberal-minded, it is
an example of desirable simplification in the direction of demotic forms.
How might the quarrel between purist and liberal be decided? The purist will
say, 'The writer of this notice ignored logic. He was talking of bus
services, not tyres, so it is not the buses but the services which run more
smoothly, and that is why he must use the comparative adverb 'more
smoothly', not the comparative adjective 'smoother', because it is the verb
'run' which is being qualified, not the noun 'buses'. Moreover, it is either
'less delay' or 'fewer delays' but not 'less delays', since in the plural
the word 'delay' is a count noun not a mass term.'
Liberals will respond by saying that the original sentence is perfectly
intelligible, which is all that matters. Purists might defend nice
distinctions and aesthetics, but liberals are unpersuaded: speakers, they
argue, wish to communicate, and whatever serves them is good English.
At least one thing is clear: as long as language exists, it will change; and
change will always provoke complaint. Among the targets in <PERSON>Richard Bailey</PERSON>'s
book are the complainers. He attacks them for wishing to preserve English in
literary aspics of one flavour or another, and he also attacks those who
think English is pre-eminent among languages, an attitude which arose with
<ORGANIZATION>Empire</ORGANIZATION> and has accompanied and promoted some of the worst excesses of
English-speakers' snobbery, colonialism, and self-aggrandisement. The
official aim of <ORGANIZATION>Bailey</ORGANIZATION>'s book is to give a 'cultural history of English';
its real aim is to expose and debunk English-speakers' pretensions.
If <PERSON>Bailey</PERSON> were just another commentator these aims would seem merely
partisan contributions to the familiar purist-liberal quarrel. But he is an
associate editor of the forthcoming <ORGANIZATION>Oxford Companion</ORGANIZATION> to the English
Language, and there is something significant about a Professor of English,
engaged in authoritative research, so clearly setting out a reductive view
of the place and importance of the English language.
Bailey begins with a surprising fact: that the number of people regularly
using English in their daily lives is only 15 per cent of the world's
population, and declining. The belief that English is an international
language and still growing in importance may bolster English-speaking egos,
but its hold on this role is slipping, according to <PERSON>Bailey</PERSON>, not just because
Japanese, German and Chinese are growing in importance, as a result of
economic influence and sheer numbers, but because English itself is
fragmenting into many varieties, some already unintelligible to the
mainstream.
By extensive use of quotation <PERSON>Bailey</PERSON> shows how English first captured the
British Isles and then, after an uncomfortable start without settled
spelling and grammar, began to impose itself abroad through colonialism.
The attitude of <ORGANIZATION>Cotton Mather</ORGANIZATION>, the 17th century American colonist and
divine, is typical; he resisted the idea of an Indian edition of the <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION>
on the ground that 'It is very sure, that the best thing we can do for our
Indians, is to Anglicize them in . . . language, as well as otherwise.'
Praise of English, efforts to increase its influence, improve its spelling,
or protect its purity, are observed by <PERSON>Bailey</PERSON> with a sardonic eye. So too
are claims about the supposed damaging tendencies of slang, neologisms and
jargon. At the same date as the Book of Common Prayer - that exquisite jewel
of the tongue - was being compiled, <PERSON>John Evelyn</PERSON> complained of English's
corruption by 'pedantry of schooles, affectation of travellers,
translations, fancy and style of Court, servility and mincing of citizens,
pulpits, political remonstrances, theatres, shopps, &amp;c' <DATE>Today</DATE> the causes of
linguistic decay are cited as television, poor education, advertising,
computer jargon, and the argot of youth culture. <PERSON>Bailey</PERSON>'s view is that the
language never decays; it merely changes.
This is true; and change is irresistible. But <PERSON>Bailey</PERSON> leaves two large points
unconsidered. First, standards may change, but they exist nevertheless. At
every point in its history there has been good and bad English of the day,
and we need to grasp the difference. And secondly, a language is as great as
its literature; all the world's great languages are rich in this respect,
English among the first. Taking this into account might have influenced some
of <ORGANIZATION>Bailey</ORGANIZATION>'s judgments more positively.

<TEXT>
   Suppose you are writing a historical novel set in 14th-century <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>. 
Your hero is an earthy innkeeper whose speech is studded with guttural 14th-century interjections. 
You want to know just what people were interjecting back then. 

   What they were interjecting was: "wellaway!" "swith!" "perfay!" "prut!" "oho!" and "goder-heal!" 
Also: "avoy!" "ow!" "gramercy!" "hosanna!" "benedicite!" "harrow!" "hoot!" "heave ho!" and "tehee!" 

   Now suppose you are a scholar tracing the influence of Australian Aborigines on world cultures. 
You want to know all the English words borrowed from the Aborigine tongue. 

   For starters, there's "boomerang" and "warrigal." 
And there's "waddy," "quandong," "humpy," "yabber," "gibber," "quoll," "teraglin" and "paddymelon" (a small brush kangaroo). 

   For years, this information was lost in the vast inner regions of the <ORGANIZATION>Oxford English Dictionary</ORGANIZATION>, 12 volumes of exhaustive definitions and etymologies, and eight centuries of illustrative quotations. 
You could pursue research queries like these two, but only by scanning all 415,000 words listed in the OED, which probably would leave you yabbering like a paddymelon. 

   This <DATE>summer</DATE> a saner alternative appeared. 
<ORGANIZATION>Oxford University Press</ORGANIZATION> has crammed the entire OED onto an electronic compact disk that looks like the CDs record stores sell. 
It took 120 people 18 months to type the dictionary into a computer, but wordsmiths everywhere will marvel at the way they have transformed the English language's richest sourcebook. 

   The electronic OED lets you search for every occurrence of a word or phrase, in several different ways. 
You can search through the definitions, the etymology notes or the labels, which are the parts of the entries that say "noun," "not in decent use," "American university slang" and the like. 
You also can look through the quotations, and their authors, sources and dates. 
And you can search several indexes at a time. 
For example: all interjections cited in quotations from the year <DATE>1300</DATE>. 

   The new version costs <MONEY>$950</MONEY>, about five times more than the popular two-volumes-and-a-magnifying-glass version of the dictionary. 
It runs on a personal computer hooked up to a disk reader, which costs about <MONEY>$700</MONEY> and is starting to become a widespread device as more references appear on CDs. 

   Rummaging through the OED on CD is like exploring a dusty warehouse of treasures that has just been mapped and catalogued for the first time. 
All sorts of whimsical and enlightening surprises lurk inside it. 

   <PERSON>Julia Swannell</PERSON>, a lexicographer on the dictionary's staff, sat down with the new version and perused it for quotations from historic cookbooks, a special interest of hers. 
She asked for all the entries from the 18th-century cookbook author <PERSON>Elizabeth Raffald</PERSON>. 
"I got a lot of what you'd sort of expect: 'apple,' 'bake,' 'boil' . . ." she says. 
"The one that sort of caught my eye was 'hedgehog.'" 

   The quotation turned out to be more innocent than <PERSON>Ms. Swannell</PERSON> surmised: "Blanch a few <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON> almonds . . . stick them round the edge of the rolls slantways . . . pour the soup upon the roll . . . some French cooks give this soup the name of hedge-hog soup." 

   Another OED editor, <PERSON>Edmund Weiner</PERSON>, demonstrated the compact disk at a recent conference in <LOCATION>Pisa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, on computational lexicography. 
He came up with a colorful list by asking for all verbs with etymologies that involve back-formation, a linguistic term for words invented on the erroneous assumption that they are the ancestors or root forms of longer words that already exist. 
The list included "burgle," "misnome," "enthuse," "jeopard," "pettifog," "locomote," "edit" and "butch" (what a butcher does). 

   On a whim, <PERSON>Mr. Weiner</PERSON> also asked for quotations that mentioned both <ORGANIZATION>Oxford</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Pisa</LOCATION>. 
The computer spat out a quotation from an <DATE>1887</DATE> history text cited under "fratry": "Agnellus of <LOCATION>Pisa</LOCATION> . . . built a school in the Fratry of Oxford." 

   I booted up the electronic OED and asked for quotations from the year <DATE>1776</DATE> that use the word "American." 
In a few seconds, my screen flashed the entry for "constantly," illustrated by an observation by <PERSON>Adam Smith</PERSON>: "In our American colonies the plantations have constantly followed the sea-coast." 

   In the entry for "Yankee," I came upon a definition labeled "Stock Exchange slang": an American stock or security. 
Seeking other words with this label, I found "hammer," "peg," "pippy" (unstable), "mummy" (an Egyptian security), "duck" (a defaulter) and "waddle" (what a duck does). 

   Among my other discoveries: an English word that derives from the Etruscan language ("mantissa"), two words that are defined as "h-shaped" ("pterion" and "zygal") and 400 words described as "echoic," or imitative of a natural sound (churr, gurgle, flicflac, hub a dub, frizz, fum, giggle, dunkadoo, gloffer, grumph . . .) 

   This CD contains the first edition of the OED, which stopped gathering quotations in <DATE>1927</DATE>. (If you're curious which authors made it into the dictionary during that last year, there were just 13, including <PERSON>Agatha Christie</PERSON>, illustrating the reflexive form of the verb "to worm": "I crawled cautiously out of the bushes, and inch by inch . . . 
I wormed myself down the steep path.") 
The Oxford lexicographers are adding later editions of the OED to the disk, using an electronic editing program called <ORGANIZATION>Oxford English Dictionary Integration Proofing</ORGANIZATION> and Updating System, or Oedipus. 

   For now, the disk highlights the many quirks and whimsies of the dictionary's earliest compilers. 
They saw fit to label two words "not in decent use" -- both of which are still too smutty to be printed in this newspaper. 
The editors also included one piece of biscuit-making terminology ("dock"); two terms of teratology, the study of monsters ("monocephalus" and "phocomele"); and one piece of American university slang: "towny." 

   The CD's laser eye also can spot revealing lessons about the history of printed English. 
It can do a quick count and tell you that there are seven quotations in the OED from <DATE>1171</DATE>, six from <DATE>1172</DATE>, seven from <DATE>1173</DATE>, seven from <DATE>1174</DATE> and 3,069 from <DATE>1175</DATE>. 
A lot of the <DATE>1175</DATE> quotations come from a source identified as "Lamb. 
Hom." 

   "Ah yes, the Lambeth Homilies," says <PERSON>Mr. Weiner</PERSON>. 
"It's quite a big religious text." 
It came out during the period between Old English and Middle English when not much else was being published, he explains. 
"It's one of the most important sources in that sort of barren bit." 

   There are no quotations on the disk from The Wall Street Journal, though <PERSON>Mr. Weiner</PERSON> says later editions of the OED have hundreds. 
But there are four citations that mention Wall Street. 
You could look it up under "operator," "Yankee," "water" and "nerve," as in "the great nerve centre of all American business."

FT  17 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Confusing trend in use of English
language
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms SYLVIA P WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Are British publishers aiming to dispose of one of their key assets -
the English language? Or is the American market the only focus of their
attention, despite the increase in British book sales over the recent
Christmas period?
I received two books at Christmas which give rise to such questions; one was
the well-reviewed Wild Swans - <PERSON>Jung Chang</PERSON>'s autobiographical view of the
development of communism in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>; the second <PERSON>Paul Merton</PERSON>'s satirical
impression of the History of the <ORGANIZATION>Twentieth Century</ORGANIZATION>. Both were printed and
published in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and in each the authors in their introduction make
specific mention of the use of English words.
Therefore the authors cannot be pleased to see American spellings in their
books. One has a PhD in linguistics from a British university and teaches in
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, and the English language must surely be central to the work of an
essentially English humorist. Wild Swans contains examples such as 'somber'
and 'maneuvring' throughout. The Merton book is not consistent in its
choice, but just on one page we see a noun and its related verb both spelt
as 'practise', along with the use of 'offense'.
Is it by accident or design that the American rather than the English
version of the 'spell-checker' seems to be in use, when most word processing
packages offer both? No wonder that so-called 'typos' regularly appear in a
range of publications (although rarely in the FT).
Those seeking to learn and use the English language today, especially by
reading, and to understand its origins and nuances, must be thoroughly
confused.
This raises a final question. Should the government really be seeking
further to involve businesses in British education?

NEW OXFORD DICTIONARY -- IMPROVING ON THE ULTIMATE

<TEXT>
<P>
The uninitiated may understandably wonder what all the fuss is about. 
</P>
<P>
Here's novelist <PERSON>Anthony Burgess</PERSON> calling it "the greatest publishing event of 
the century." It is to be marked by a half-day seminar and lunch at that bluest 
of blue-blood <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> hostelries, <ORGANIZATION>Claridge's</ORGANIZATION>. The guest list of 250 dignitaries 
is a literary "Who's Who." 
</P>
<P>
All this is to mark the publication next <DATE>Thursday</DATE> of the second edition of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Oxford English Dictionary</ORGANIZATION> -- the OED2 to the cogniscenti -- 61 years after the 
first edition. 
</P>
<P>
Claridge's for a dictionary? With this kind of build-up you might have expected 
at least some newly discovered work of <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION>. But then, the <ORGANIZATION>Oxford 
English Dictionary</ORGANIZATION> is to most other dictionaries what <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION> is to a comic 
book, or Stradivarius to a fiddle. 
</P>
<P>
Admirers say the 20-volume second edition should not even be mentioned in the 
same breath with the single-volume compendium of words that most of us keep on 
our bookshelves for help in writing term papers or cheating on crossword 
puzzles. It's like comparing a communications satellite with a walkie-talkie. 
</P>
<P>
This dictionary costs <MONEY>$2,500</MONEY>. It represents more than a century of awesome 
scholarship and has been dubbed no less than "the leading repository for the 
English language." But you can also read it for fun. 
</P>
<P>
The Independent newspaper's <DATE>Sunday</DATE> magazine called it "this monumental, 
indispensable, and slightly eccentric work." 
</P>
<P>
What makes the Oxford dictionary so special -- and so long -- are the nearly 
2.5 million quotations it uses to illustrate the evolution in meaning and 
context of each word, from its earliest recorded usage to an appropriate modern 
example. 
</P>
<P>
Like its less ambitious kin, the dictionary has a pronunciation guide, 
etymology, and definitions for each word, too. But the quotations put it in a 
different league by telling the story of a language. 
</P>
<P>
They reveal, for example, that in the 13th Century the word nice meant 
"ignorant." It took hundreds of years for it to take on its modern meaning of 
"pleasant," passing en route through "foolish," "over-scrupulous," and 
"precise." 
</P>
<P>
The dictionary's co-editor, <PERSON>Edmund Weiner</PERSON> described his role as more a 
historian of language than an arbiter of usage. He doesn't usually get upset 
when he hears someone misuse a word, <PERSON>Weiner</PERSON> said in an interview. He gets 
curious, wondering whether it is just part of the mysterious process by which a 
language grows. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Words as Actually Used 
</P>
<P>
The dictionary doesn't judge, either. It records the way words are actually 
used, even if grammarians and scholars disapprove. It also records their 
disapproval. 
</P>
<P>
The word fulsome, for example, used to mean "insincere." But because of 
confusion with the word "full," now it is often used when the speaker means 
"ample" or "generous." Thus, the "fulsome apology" once deemed hypocritical may 
now be acceptable, and that reality is duly noted in the dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
One of the 5,000 new words and meanings in the second edition is bad, which 
means "excellent" in modern American slang. 
</P>
<P>
Other new entries range from "AMEX" and "artsy-fartsy" to "palimony" and 
"yuppification." Medicine contributes "acupressure," "biofeedback," 
"brain-dead" and "passive smoking," while commerce offers "greenmail," "fast 
track" and "plastic money." 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Oxford University Press</ORGANIZATION>, publisher of both editions of the dictionary, claims 
that the English language grows by at least 450 words a year. <PERSON>Weiner</PERSON> believes 
that is a gross underestimate. Either way, it explains why the publisher has 
been running a losing race with words ever since <DATE>1879</DATE> when it first signed a 
contract with <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s Philological Society to produce an authoritative 
dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Self-Taught Lexicographer 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>James A. H. Murray</PERSON>, a Scottish grammar school teacher and self-taught 
lexicographer, became the Oxford dictionary's first editor with the idea of 
producing a four-volume dictionary in 10 years. By the time he died 36 years 
later, in <DATE>1915</DATE>, <PERSON>Murray</PERSON> had carried his project into the T's. His successors 
finally finished the 12-volume first edition in <DATE>1928</DATE>, and as staggering an 
enterprise as it was, it was already far enough out of date that it needed a 
supplement. 
</P>
<P>
A one-volume supplement in <DATE>1933</DATE> was followed between <DATE>1972</DATE> and <DATE>1986</DATE> by four 
more. But well before the last supplement had appeared, <PERSON>Weiner</PERSON>, co-editor <PERSON>John 
Simpson</PERSON>, and their colleagues were hard at work on the completely new edition 
that debuts <DATE>March 30</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The new edition includes all the material from the original and the 
supplements, plus the new words and meanings. The additions, said <PERSON>Weiner</PERSON>, 
reflect the way in which the language is growing. 
</P>
<P>
There has been an "explosion" in words that were once proprietary, but which 
have now become "not just proper names, but also items of general culture," 
said <PERSON>Weiner</PERSON>. There were only a dozen or so in the first edition, he noted -- 
words like "Vaseline," "Thermos" and "Hoover." Among the scores of new such 
entries in the second edition are "Diner's Club," "Visa" and "Fortune 500." 
They are the modern equivalent, <PERSON>Weiner</PERSON> said, of the way that the names of 
geographical locations were once applied to generic carpets, wines, and other 
artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
"Rambo" rates more words in OED2 than he has spoken in some of his films. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growth of Acronyms 
</P>
<P>
Acronyms are another growth category -- "probably one of the most important 
changes in word formation in the <DATE>20th Century</DATE>," according to <PERSON>Weiner</PERSON>. Debuting 
in the second edition, for example, are "AIDS" (acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome), "AMEX" (<ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>), "PIN" (personal identification number), 
and "START" (Strategic Arms Reduction Talks). 
</P>
<P>
One of <ORGANIZATION>Weiner</ORGANIZATION>'s regrets about the new edition is its failure to include another 
acronym -- "DINK" (dual income, no kids). When the editors were compiling the 
"D" section of the dictionary a couple of years ago, he said, there wasn't 
enough evidence that the term would catch on. "It looked like it might be 
ephemeral." So it was left out. Now, said <PERSON>Weiner</PERSON>, he's convinced <ORGANIZATION>DINK</ORGANIZATION> is "a 
word of the '80s." 
</P>
<P>
The first edition, some say, was really a dictionary of British English. But to 
whatever extent that may have been true, it's much less so in the second 
edition. Weiner estimated that at least half the new words and meanings in the 
second edition originated in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"The English language is now really a big federation," the 38-year-old 
co-editor commented. And because it has the largest single concentration of 
native English speakers, <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> is where there is the most dynamic 
change in the language. It may be an extraordinary view for an Englishman, 
<PERSON>Weiner</PERSON> acknowledged, but "we can't be Brito-centric and turn our back on the 
rest of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the dictionary's original editor, <PERSON>Murray</PERSON>, would probably be less 
surprised by the changes in his dictionary than by the changes in the way it is 
produced. Thanks to computer technology and international cooperation, the new 
edition required only five years to complete -- about one-tenth the time of its 
predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Printed in <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> 
</P>
<P>
The new edition was printed by <ORGANIZATION>Rand McNally</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, and computerized in 
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and Oxford using some remarkable software developed at the <ORGANIZATION>University 
of Waterloo</ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the <ORGANIZATION>Oxford</ORGANIZATION> dictionary is computerized, said <PERSON>Weiner</PERSON>, it will be easier 
to keep pace with the changing English language. The dictionary will be updated 
continually, and perhaps more important, an electronic version is expected to 
be available commercially within two years, opening up an extraordinary range 
of research and cross-referencing possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Want to know how many times a particular source is cited? The <LOCATION>Waterloo</LOCATION> software 
is able to scan all 59 million words in the new edition and give the answer. It 
was able to determine in seconds that the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> Times is cited as the 
source of a quotation 71 times in the new edition. 
</P>
<P>
The electronic version also includes a "reverse dictionary capability" -- it 
can locate a word if the user feeds in key elements of the definition. 
</P>
<P>
That means the second edition of the <ORGANIZATION>Oxford English Dictionary</ORGANIZATION> may be the 
answer to the perennial dilemma of the poor speller: How can you check a 
spelling if you don't know how the word's spelled to begin with? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe <PERSON>Burgess</PERSON> is right. More Champagne anyone?

   <PERSON>Elisabeth Ann Zinser</PERSON>, who resigned as
president of <ORGANIZATION>Gallaudet University</ORGANIZATION> amid protests from students who
want a deaf leader, enraged students and faculty at the school for
the hearing impaired by suggesting she would quickly learn sign
language.
   In truth, say professors at <LOCATION>Gallaudet</LOCATION>, learning sign language _
widely considered the nation's third most frequently used
``foreign'' language _ is as difficult as mastering Russian or
Chinese.
   ``She (Zinser) thought she would come in here and pick up sign
language in three months,'' said <PERSON>Robert Johnson</PERSON>, an audiology
professor at the nation's only liberal arts college for the hearing
impaired. ``Unfortunately, you don't catch sign like you catch a
cold.''
   There are three different varieties of sign language, the purest
of which has no connection with the English language, while the
crudest version relies heavily on English vocabulary and sentence
structure, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   Johnson and <PERSON>Scott Lidell</PERSON>, both professors in <LOCATION>Gallaudet</LOCATION>'s
department of linguistics, say around 2 million Americans are
considered deaf by audiometric standards, while 18 million others
suffer from some hearing loss.
   Those who use sign language are usually in the smaller group,
while persons with less severe hearing loss do not usually learn
sign language. The majority of <ORGANIZATION>Gallaudet</ORGANIZATION>'s students are profoundly
deaf, and use sign language, according to school officials.
   American Sign Language, the purest form of signing, is commonly
used between people who are either profoundly deaf, or have been
deaf since birth, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said. Comparing <ORGANIZATION>ASL</ORGANIZATION> to the use of a
foreign language, <ORGANIZATION>ASL</ORGANIZATION> users are roughly equivalent to those fluent
in a foreign tongue.
   But similarities with written or spoken language end there,
<PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> emphasized.
   ``English relies on a linear structure, with one word following
the last, but in <ORGANIZATION>ASL</ORGANIZATION>, the message is conveyed through simultaneous
use of facial expressions, finger signs, and motions,'' <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>
said.
   <ORGANIZATION>ASL</ORGANIZATION> has a base vocabulary on which general themes, not
individual words, are built. Images, rather than words expressed in
sign, convey the signer's message.
   ``It's extremely time-efficient,'' <PERSON>Lidell</PERSON> said. ``You have two
hands, a face, and a body participating in delivering the message.
In spoken or written English, you have just words. Signing gives
you more channels.''
   Deaf people comunicating with hearing people mix sign language
with some components of formal English, the result being a type of
sign language called <ORGANIZATION>Contact Variety Signing</ORGANIZATION>, or Pidgin Sign
English.
   In the <ORGANIZATION>Contact Variety</ORGANIZATION> method, the message expressed may use
numerous images associated with <ORGANIZATION>ASL</ORGANIZATION>, but the message is based on
the syntax of an English sentence.
   It is this form of communication through which Gallaudet student
protest leaders, with the assistance of interpreters, conveyed
their message to the media and campus onlookers.
   Sign Supported English is the third type of sign. It does not
rely on facial expressions, and involves sending messages primarily
with spoken English. Signing symbols are used to reinforce the
spoken message, in what <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> describes as ``coding speech on the
hands.''
   Sign Supported English, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said, is slow and awkward, and
is the only type of sign language Zinser could have learned in less
than six months. There are sign language symbols for each of the 26
characters in the English alphabet, and, when signers cannot find a
symbol for an English word, they may spell out the English word,
then return to sign. Fingerspelling is used in all three types of
sign.
   Gallaudet professors, <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> of whom are deaf, are required
to know sign language, and must pass sign examinations for
promotions or raises, according to <PERSON>Roger Beach</PERSON>, a counseling
professor who designed <ORGANIZATION>Gallaudet</ORGANIZATION>'s exam program.

<HEAD>Language Campaign Controversial in Multilingual Philippines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By YASMIN ARQUIZA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 15-year campaign to promote
Filipino as the national language has stirred controversy in the
<LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> where more than 80 languages and dialects are spoken.
   In <DATE>1973</DATE>, when he was president, <PERSON>Ferdinand E. Marcos</PERSON> mandated a
policy of using English and Filipino, a Malay language based on the
<LOCATION>Tagalog</LOCATION> dialect, in elementary and high schools.
   English had been used exclusively in schools since the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> took control of the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> in <DATE>1899</DATE> and is
still widely spoken by the educated elite.
   The new constitution, drafted after President <PERSON>Corazon Aquino</PERSON>
took office from <PERSON>Marcos</PERSON>, reinforced the commitment to promote
Filipino while retaining English as a second official language.
Spanish was dropped as an official language.
   Last year, the <ORGANIZATION>Education Department</ORGANIZATION> declared that English would
no longer be an exclusive language for teaching science and
technology in elementary and high schools and that Filipino should
be developed ``as a linguistic symbol of national unity and
identity.''
   As part of the drive, government television switched its main
evening newscast from English to Filipino. Four of the five private
television stations have expanded the use of Filipino in newscasts.
   <PERSON>Ponciano Pineda</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Institute for Philippine
Languages</ORGANIZATION>, said the bilingual campaign is designed to ``make
Filipino the language of intellectual pursuit.''
   But the campaign has run into stumbling blocks because of the
nature and background of the language.
   In the <DATE>1930s</DATE>, President <PERSON>Manuel Quezon</PERSON> decreed that the
Manila-area dialect, <LOCATION>Tagalog</LOCATION>, would become the basis of a national
language.
   But <LOCATION>Tagalog</LOCATION> is used as the principal language by only about <PERCENT>30
percent</PERCENT> of the country's 58 million people. Speakers of various
<LOCATION>Visayan</LOCATION> dialects, used in the central islands and <LOCATION>Mindanao</LOCATION>, form a
slight majority.
   To make the decision more palatable to other linguistic groups,
the language was called ``Pilipino'' and later ``Filipino.'' Some
words and grammatical constructions from other native languages
were added.
   That has led to a debate among language scholars over spellings,
as well as the extent to which foreign words, notably English,
should be considered acceptable.
   A group of professors tried to promote phonetic spellings, such
as ``sabjek'' for the English ``subject'' and ``nawn'' for ``noun''
in an effort to mirror Filipino pronunciation.
   Pineda of the languages institute says borrowing of words can be
acceptable if they have been ``Filipinized,'' such as ``kudeta''
for ``coup d'etat.''
   But the widespread use of ``loan words'' has produced what
critics call ``Taglish'' a mix English and <LOCATION>Tagalog</LOCATION>.
   Educated Filipinos, especially in <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>, frequently switch from
English to Filipino in conversations, beginning a sentence in one
language and ending it in the other.
   Words such as ``magbeysbol,'' or ``to play baseball,'' have
crept into the language. The residue of 350 years of Spanish
colonialism lives on in such words as ``mesa,'' for table and
``tindahan'' from the Spanish ``tienda,'' meaning shop.
   Professor <PERSON>Jesus Ramos</PERSON>, a Filipino-language teacher at the
<ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, defends the use of English words
because it ``mirrors the use of the national language by all
Filipinos.''
   Most of the nearly 30 newspapers in <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> are published in
English, as are numerous legal documents, magazines and books.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Aquino</PERSON>, who was educated in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, uses English
for most of her major speeches. Debates in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> are normally
conducted in English.
   Critics complain that the bilingual policy has resulted in a
deterioration of English skills. They believe the country should be
promoting English because it affords greater opportunity for study
and work here and abroad.
   But <PERSON>Pineda</PERSON> said: ``The purpose for which we started teaching
English in the <DATE>1900s</DATE> no longer holds. We used to think that only
through the window of English could we look at the picture of life,
but we have discovered that this is not true.''
   Professor <PERSON>Ramos</PERSON> predicts that Filipino eventually will supplant
English and that the need for English loan words will fade.
   ``If English will weaken here, borrowing of English words will
also lessen,'' he said.

<HEAD>A Mammoth Second Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>OXFORD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 5,000 ``new'' words in the second
edition of the <ORGANIZATION>Oxford English Dictionary</ORGANIZATION> say more about the glacial
pace of lexicography than about the age of the words.
   There are freshly minted terms such as AIDS-related, antiquark,
fax, <ORGANIZATION>Filofax</ORGANIZATION> and ghetto-blaster; words or word senses redolent of
the <DATE>1960s</DATE> such as acid, downer, grok and chopper, and jazz-age
coinages such as <ORGANIZATION>Big Apple</ORGANIZATION>.
   There's even one new word from Anglo-Saxon: ``ash,'' the symbol
that combines the letters A and E.
   The second edition, to be published <DATE>March 29</DATE>, reflects more than
a century of scholarly labor.
   It pulls together the 400,000 entries in the first edition,
completed between <DATE>1879</DATE> and <DATE>1928</DATE>; the first supplement of <DATE>1933</DATE>; the
four-volume second supplement of 1972-1986; and the 5,000 new
entries.
   That chronology explains why the OED took so long to catch up
with ``Big Apple,'' <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>'s nickname.
   The first use of the term recorded by the dictionary is in <DATE>1927</DATE>,
though ``we've since heard there was record of it in <DATE>1906</DATE>,'' said
<PERSON>John Simpson</PERSON>, the co-editor responsible for new words in the second
edition.
   ``Now, in the first edition of OED the letter B came out in <DATE>1885</DATE>,
<DATE>1886</DATE>, so (Big Apple) wasn't available for inclusion then.
   ``I think it was a pity it wasn't included in the supplement.
Perhaps it wasn't really widely well known. I don't know.''
   Simpson also doesn't know why his entry for ``Pythonesque,''
inspired by the satirical lunacies of comedy troupe called <PERSON>Monty
Python</PERSON>'s Flying Circus, was ultimately rejected by <PERSON>Robert
Burchfield</PERSON>, editor of the second supplement.
   ``So I thought, I've had enough of that, so I put it back in
again for the second edition,'' <PERSON>Simpson</PERSON> said. ``Nobody objected so
it's gone in.''
   Also inducted: acid rain, acupressure, barf, bleeper, creation
science, detox, <ORGANIZATION>Diner's Club</ORGANIZATION>, dingbat, duty-free, endangered, est,
fast track, foxy, <ORGANIZATION>Great Leap Forward</ORGANIZATION>, greenmail, lap-top, nose job,
passive smoking, plastic money and Visa.
   From now on, the 20-volume dictionary will be subject to rapid
updating because this edition was prepared on a computer. <ORGANIZATION>Oxford
University Press</ORGANIZATION> hopes to offer it on computer discs by <DATE>1991</DATE>.
   The computer version will solve the age-old problem of looking up
a word you can't remember. The computer can look for definitions,
and much more.
   The basic work of lexicography, however, is still done on index
cards, now numbering in excess of 3 million, each containing a
quotation found by a paid or volunteer reader to illustrate the use
of a word.
   The method is the same used by <PERSON>James A.H. Murray</PERSON>, the first
editor of the OED, who took on what was supposed to be a 10-year
task in <DATE>1879</DATE> and had completed the letter T at his death in <DATE>1915</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Murray</PERSON>, who appears in photos looking like an Old Testament
figure in mortarboard and long white beard, instructed his
researchers to ``make a quotation for every word that strikes you as
rare, obsolete, old-fashioned, new, peculiar, or used in a peculiar
way.'' They were also asked to produce as many quotations as
possible for ordinary words.
   The OED surveys English from the middle of the <DATE>12th century</DATE>, and
the research net covered the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australasia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and
the English-speaking parts of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>.
   ``We regard the OED as an international dictionary now,'' said
co-editor <PERSON>Edmund Weiner</PERSON>.
   That's reflected in its production. The dictionary was edited in
<LOCATION>Oxford</LOCATION>, the computer program was developed by the <ORGANIZATION>University of
Waterloo</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION>, the text was keyboarded in <LOCATION>Fort Washington</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, and the 10,000 sets, each weighing 137.7 pounds, were printed
in <LOCATION>Taunton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>.
   It's hard to explain exactly when a word becomes so widely used
that it qualifies for the OED, <PERSON>Weiner</PERSON> said, but in practice words
are almost always added by consensus, based on citations from
printed sources.
   ``It is not our job to lay down what standard English is,'' said
<PERSON>Weiner</PERSON>, but to produce a photograph of English as it is used.
   ``The dictionary records the language, warts and all,'' <PERSON>Simpson</PERSON>
said. ``I would say we don't prescribe ourselves, but we try to make
it obvious in the entries if you are dealing with a particular use
that a group of people dislike.''
   If a word is misused enough, it may rate an entry. Thus,
contractural, a common misspelling of contractual, earned a citation
in the OED, <PERSON>Simpson</PERSON> said.
   Some day, it may be the standard spelling.
   `Over history, over and over again, you see what was originally a
non-standard variation becoming standard, and the standard one
becoming old-fashioned and falling out of use,'' <PERSON>Weiner</PERSON> said.
   ``These days, `disinterested' is condemned when being used in the
sense of not interested, but actually it's older in that sense. ...
   ``We can only report that people, grammarians or whatever, said
that a usage was wrong,'' <PERSON>Weiner</PERSON> said. ``But very often you will
find in the quotations that Shakespeare or <PERSON>Dryden</PERSON> or whoever
actually did use this supposedly wrong usage, and that rather
confounds the extreme prescriptivist point of view.''

Foodies and Femtoseconds

<TEXT>
   All the people who are currently so upset about the decline of literacy in this country are certainly not preaching their sermons to deaf ears. 
Large numbers of readers are buying their books and even larger numbers are buying dictionaries, presumably to help themselves become more literate. 
Two of the five titles on the self-help best-seller list produced by <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s leading local paper are desk-top dictionaries. 
"<PERSON>Webster</PERSON>'s New World Dictionary" (<ORGANIZATION>Simon &amp; Schuster</ORGANIZATION>, 1,692 pages, <MONEY>$16.95</MONEY>), the authority relied on by editors at the Journal, has been a best seller 26 times. 
"<PERSON>Webster</PERSON>'s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary" (Merriam-Webster, 1,533 pages, <MONEY>$14.95</MONEY>) has been on the list 118 times, having just sneaked ahead of "Super Marital Sex." 

   The lexical passion thrives in this country in a pragmatic way. 
Where the multivolume "Oxford English Dictionary" looks mostly backward and gives today's lingo only a guarded nod, our dictionaries are for use, proudly up-to-date, welcoming to new words and modes of diction, portable or at least in single volumes. 
The golden age of the American dictionary ended in <DATE>1961</DATE> when Merriam-Webster replaced the peerless second edition of its unabridged dictionary with the "Third New International Dictionary." 
Webster's Second (W2) simply overwhelms the competition because it has more words and better words -- in other words, words an adult might need to look up. 

   This is surely the main point of a big dictionary for the general reader. 
If W3 struck many of us as an ignoble retreat from this ideal -- in favor of slack standards and terms too new to belong in a dictionary -- then "The <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> Dictionary of the English Language" in its first edition (<DATE>1966</DATE>, RD1) tried to satisfy both camps, the moldy figs and those who wanted to cast off the fig leaves of lexical modesty. 
Now we have RD2 (2,500 pages, <MONEY>$79.95</MONEY>). 
It is bigger (more than 50,000 new entries) and conceptually better. 
Biographical and geographical entries are alphabetized with the other words. 
RD2 has an updated four-color 32-page atlas, a history of the English language and, for him or her who wants it, advice on how to avoid sexism in writing. 
As <PERSON>Bennett Cerf</PERSON>, co-founder of <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION>, once put it, "Safari, sogoody." 

   But what about the words? 
You could do far worse and will have trouble doing better without hunting for W2 in the out-of-print market. 
RD2 has more than 315,000 entries. 
They include the old (scutage) and the new (junkbond) but not the barbarous (herstory). 
Almost everyone will find what he is looking for in RD2 most of the time, but it is not hard to find holes and unevenness. 
Beard fanciers will miss pogonotomy. 
Under kiwi, the complex entry does not distinguish clearly between the bird and the plant, and gives the scientific name of the plant only in another entry under its other, now rarely used, vernacular name, Chinese gooseberry. 
The etymology for schmuck is incomplete and misleading; only the obscene Yiddish meaning is given while the High German cognate, an everyday term for jewel, is omitted. 
<PERSON>George Henry Lewes</PERSON> is identified merely as an English writer and critic, but not, as most people, even nonsexists, think of him, as the lover of <PERSON>George Eliot</PERSON>. 
These are quibbles, but they are not cheap shots. 
No dictionary can be truly universal, especially not a single-volume dictionary. 
But the flaws just mentioned were caught by random page-flipping in a few minutes. 
It was impossible to survey the text thoroughly, but a spot check revealed that the rare Shakespearean word scammel, from "The Tempest," is not included, which makes one wonder if other words in <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION>'s vocabulary are also missing. 
At the very least, dictionaries should have the bard thoroughly covered. 

   Still, one is glad for the riches that are offered, and that are now being promoted with a <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> budget. 
It was a delight to turn from a newspaper account that mentioned that unimaginably short piece of time, the femtosecond, to find in RD2 not only that femto- is a combining form signifying a quadrillionth, but that it comes from the Danish for 15 (in scientific notation a quadrillionth is 10 to the negative 15th power). 
How did femto- come into English? 
I suspect the hand of that very great <PERSON>Dane</PERSON>, physicist <PERSON>Niels Bohr</PERSON>. 

   Another new word defined in RD2 is foodie. 
The man who gave this perhaps unnecessary new name for gourmet its widest currency is not himself listed in RD2, but he is working hard to make the next edition. 
<PERSON>Paul Levy</PERSON>, the Kentucky-born food and wine editor of the Observer (<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>) produced in <DATE>1984</DATE> a facetious but factual account of contemporary gastronomic life called "The Official Foodie Handbook." 
<PERSON>Mr. Levy</PERSON> has also written a study of British philosopher <ORGANIZATION>G.E. Moore</ORGANIZATION>. 
And he has written occasionally for this page. 

   Now his fellow Americans can see <PERSON>Mr. Levy</PERSON> whole for the first time. 
And there is a lot of him. 
In the new collection of his assorted writings called "Out to Lunch" (<ORGANIZATION>Harper &amp; Row</ORGANIZATION>, 240 pages, <MONEY>$18.95</MONEY>), we find <PERSON>Mr. Levy</PERSON> busy nearly everywhere, from <LOCATION>Peking</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>. 
He eats dog in <LOCATION>Macao</LOCATION> and drinks Armagnac in the former home of <LOCATION>D'Artagnan</LOCATION>. 
He debunks the mystique of truffle hunting and he tells you everything worth knowing about pastrami down to its post-Ottoman etymology (RD2 is very good on pastrami also). 
Since it is the policy of this department to present but not to judge books written by our regular contributors, suffice it to say, by way of recommendation, that my first copy of "Out to Lunch" was stolen off my desk.

speaking, it was another example of "mincing words in a way that isn't 
necessary." So, when President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> finally used the "H" word in a speech 
earlier this week, <PERSON>Bryson</PERSON> saw it as a welcome meshing of language with reality. 
He applied the same reasoning to the quibbling over whether the cutoff of 
supplies to <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> was or was not a blockade. 
</P>
<P>
"That's precisely what they are doing," he said. "The Iraqis are holding 
hostages and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> responded with a blockade." 
</P>
<P>
Bryson also noted that diplomatic niceties weren't observed when Iraqi 
President <PERSON>Saddam Hussein</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> described each other. Each head of state 
chose the same epithet, liar, to describe his enemy. 
</P>
<P>
To the Iowa-born writer who has lived in <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION> for the <DATE>last 15 years</DATE>, 
the crossed words over the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> are only the latest go-round in a long 
scrutiny of the English language. Even before he ever thought of writing "The 
Mother Tongue: English &amp; How It Got That Way," <PERSON>Bryson</PERSON>, 38, admits to being 
a "random" collector of tidbits about the language. 
</P>
<P>
With the publication of "The Mother Tongue," <PERSON>Bryson</PERSON> demonstrates that he has 
concentrated this previously unfocused penchant into a potential career. The 
book is a main selection of the <ORGANIZATION>Book-of-the-Month Club</ORGANIZATION>, a latter-day <LOCATION>Eldorado</LOCATION> 
for writers and publishers. Moreover, the book has been widely and favorably 
reviewed by critics charmed by <PERSON>Bryson</PERSON>'s mixing of voluminous research with a 
humorous, anecdotal style. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the book opens with the dry comment, "More than 300 million 
people in the world speak English and the rest, it sometimes seems, try to." 
</P>
<P>
In the next paragraph, <PERSON>Bryson</PERSON> quotes an announcement found in a hotel in 
<LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>: "The flattening of underwear with pleasure is the job of the 
chambermaid. Turn to her straightaway." Then he cites a pseudo-English warning 
to drivers in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>: "When a passenger of the foot heave in sight, tootle the 
horn. Trumpet at him melodiously at first, but if he still obstacles your 
passage, then tootle him with vigor." 
</P>
<P>
Much further along -- toward the end of the book, in fact -- <PERSON>Bryson</PERSON>'s chapter 
on swearing notes that in the <DATE>19th Century</DATE>, an "outburst of prudery . . . swept 
through the world like a fever." In its wake, Victorians desperately fell to 
using anatomical euphemisms: stomach for belly; drumstick, first joint and 
white meat for the leg, thigh and breast of a chicken. Perhaps most extremely, 
bulls were called "gentlemen cows." 
</P>
<P>
While these examples may lack the sweep and majesty of the English language in 
the hands of a Churchill or <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION>, they fit the criteria laid down by 
<PERSON>Bryson</PERSON> for inclusion in his book: 
</P>
<P>
"Did it actually tell you something useful about the language or was it 
entertaining," he explains. "That was my whole idea, to share the delight and 
fascination with English that I have." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, <PERSON>Bryson</PERSON>'s book is as full of factoids as a clear-cut forest is full of 
stumps. For instance, he reports that in his plays and poems, <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION> used 
17,677 words, "of which at least one-tenth had never been used before." His 
list of <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION>'s word inventions includes leapfrog, monumental, castigate, 
hurry, pedant and obscene. 
</P>
<P>
While <PERSON>Bryson</PERSON> said he has no pretense of changing or enlarging the language, he 
admitted that writing the book made him something of a language liberal. 
</P>
<P>
"I have become less convinced that we have to be really strict in our usage of 
the language," he said. "For instance, one reviewer criticized me because I 
asked in the book 'who by and who for.' She pointed out it should be 'whom by 
and whom for.' I was aware that was the correct way it should be, but it seemed 
to me to write it 'whom by and whom for' would be incredibly pretentious and 
pompous." 
</P>
<P>
Such critics, he asserted, "fail sometimes to recognize that one of the glories 
of the English language is that it does grow and evolve and expand, and that it 
has this enormous flexibility." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "More and more I'm moving to the view that people are too fussy about 
the language. They think that proper English usage is a matter of learning a 
whole set of rules and blindly and arbitrarily following them. I think it's a 
lot more subtle than that." 
</P>
<P>
Having said that, however, <PERSON>Bryson</PERSON> cautioned that he is not a radical who can 
tolerate slipshod use of his mother tongue. "I think there's a great case for 
precision in the language, and we should respect distinctions between words, 
between imply and infer and flout and flaunt." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, <PERSON>Bryson</PERSON> maintained that his book is largely a work of reporting, not 
an opinionated essay. "There are not a whole lot of my own views in there," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The tedium of objective research sometimes made <PERSON>Bryson</PERSON> slightly crazy. 
"Sometimes it felt like I was doing 20 college term papers all at once. It was 
homework," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence of the latter is right there in the back of the book, a select 
bibliography of more than 100 books on English, ranging from various 
dictionaries and histories of the language to "Sociolinguistics: An 
Introduction to Language and Society" and "A Dictionary of International 
Slurs." 
</P>
<P>
And it was homework in a literal sense for <PERSON>Bryson</PERSON>, who used to work for <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> 
newspapers but is now a free-lancer. He lives 250 miles from <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and half an 
hour from "the nearest town with shops," he says. "By British standards, that's 
incredibly remote." 
</P>
<P>
Yet his isolation carries its own lesson about the huge variations -- and 
fierce parochialisms -- of the English language. 
</P>
<P>
"I live in this little dale in <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION>, a valley that's five miles long, and 
people swear they can tell that you were born up the dale or down the dale by 
the way you speak," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Bryson himself has undergone an audible change since he moved to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in the 
mid-1970s. Although a native of the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>, his voice now hails from the 
<LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
When his accent is pointed out, he shrugs it off. "I know," he says with a hint 
of resignation. "It's been pointed out to me over and over again. The funny 
thing is, I resisted as consciously as I could giving up my American accent. I 
still pronounce words exactly as I did when I left home. I still say bath and 
banana and tomato (the way Americans do), and I don't say TEWsday, I say 
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>." 
</P>
<P>
He adds: "I think the problem is that living over there for a long time, your 
cadence and your rhythms (of speech) all change."

<TEXT>
There is a sportswear shop in <LOCATION>Calais</LOCATION> called 'Athlete's Foot'. I was thinking
of it last week in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> on my way to the <ORGANIZATION>Academie Francaise</ORGANIZATION>, that venerable
custodian of the French language, when I passed a marine equipment shop
called '<ORGANIZATION>Nauti Store</ORGANIZATION>'.
As I crossed the <LOCATION>Seine</LOCATION> in the <DATE>spring</DATE> sunshine, pondering the Balladur
government's announcement of a language bill with stiffer penalties to
enforce the public use of French, I was nearly run over by a breakdown van.
Painted in large letters on its side were the words 'Yellow Cad'.
The perpetual secretary of the academie, its commanding officer in the war
against linguistic corruption, is the writer and anglophile <PERSON>Maurice Druon</PERSON>.
'Je vais commencer alors par un statement,' he said as he ushered me with a
flourish of Gallic courtesies into his elegant cabinet room. 'I'm a great
admirer of the style of <PERSON>Gibbon</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Churchill</ORGANIZATION>. Bon. Voila comment je vous
accueille.'
Druon does not, God forbid, speak franglais. He is a former minister of
culture, member of the French and European parliaments and a winner of the
<ORGANIZATION>Prix Goncourt</ORGANIZATION>. He was with de <ORGANIZATION>Gaulle</ORGANIZATION>'s Free French in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> during the
second world war.
No, he switches with virtuous ease between the two tongues, according to the
mood of the moment. In his own language he is declamatory, rolling the words
around his tongue with the relish of a wine-taster. In English he has the
upper-class drawl of the clubman (he is a member of the <PERSON>Garrick</PERSON> and the
Savile), and makes redundant apologies for the poverty of his syntax and
pronunciation.
We sat in matching armchairs with aged leather seats. The first 'Immortals',
the founder members of the academy set up by <PERSON>Cardinal Richelieu</PERSON> in <DATE>1635</DATE> as a
supreme court to decide the rules of French, looked down from the walls.
'A cup of tea, perhaps?' said the perpetual secretary.
A butler arrived and set down a silver tray. I began by asking: What,
really, is the threat? Isn't the academy's attempt to preserve the language
culturally stifling?
Druon sighed. 'I answer in another way. I much regret that you have not an
academie anglaise, a state institution to watch over your language.'
As for the academy's work, he continued: 'Did that stop the Enlightenment,
the philosophes of the 18th century? Did it stop the industrial age, the
discoveries of the <DATE>19th century</DATE>? Did that stop Pasteur? Did it stop <PERSON>Claude
Bernard</PERSON>, or - closer to us - the Curies or the Duc de Broglie?'
But aren't things different now? Perhaps French is becoming fossilised . . .
'Fossilised?' Druon stared with disbelief. 'Fossilised? When in the first
volume of our dictionary we have 5,000 new words? In the former edition, of
<DATE>1935</DATE>, there were about 35,000 words. Our new edition (it has reached the
word 'enzyme') will have at least 50,000 words, probably more - that is,
15,000 accepted new ones.'
He got up and walked about. 'Do you play golf?' he said. I said No. 'When
people propose oiselet for 'birdie' or, I don't know, obstacle de sable for
'bunker' I raise my shoulders and I say 'Let the expression pass] Foutez-moi
la paix]' Because golf terms are English and we have adopted them.'
The academy had even accepted anglicisms such as 'tennis' which derived from
the French - as in tenez]
To recognise words for which there is no substitute is one thing, I
persisted. To legislate for the control of language seems to me quite
another, extraordinary thing.
'Sir. You have been informed by the French press, which is very badly
informed.' He gave his wheezy, smoker's laugh. 'It's not a law on the French
language, it's a law on the obligation of using French in various areas.'
Yet if it suits a firm to use English internally and that facilitates
business, why not?
'Why use a foreign language if the user is not an English speaker?' In some
cases, he added, it could even be dangerous - if, for example, technical
instruction manuals were not in French.
I agreed. But there was a time, I said, when the whole of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> used Latin
for certain purposes. Today we clearly need a lingua franca and . . .
'But exactly] You have the French language]' He was triumphant.
Isn't English the lingua franca now?
'Listen. There we are going to have a difference of opinion. For one thing,
the English language is no longer what it was. What is sprayed all over the
world is not really English. It's American. It's not the English tongue,
it's a dollar tongue.'
But the Latin spoken all over <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> was dog Latin, not the Latin of Tacitus
or <LOCATION>Cicero</LOCATION>.
'Certainly. That's why it has been replaced by the French]'
If this bastard English is useful, why should we not speak it where it's
appropriate?
'Where is this notion of useful? It's useful in commerce, in advertising,
useful in money. It is not useful for the mind.'
The academy has about 40 members - usually septuagenarians - of whom <PERSON>Maurice
Druon</PERSON>, of course, is one. (There are also two women now). I stuck out my
neck.
Why should the language of the majority, I asked, be determined by the
sentiment of an old minority?
'It's not an old minority. It's an old majority.'
But why should they have this power?
'Sir. Words are a means of exchange. That's a currency, and bad currency . .
. comment dire, chasse . . . drives out, the good. We are trying to keep a
good currency. That's why we accept a lot of new words if they are in common
usage. Don't think we are the enemy of English . . .'
I read that people refuse to employ the gallicisms that have been created
for them. Why not let the market decide what is most appropriate?
'If you let in the market, you let in the jungle.'
Can you resist the market in this age?
'Bien sur. Bien sur. One can dissuade. Monsieur, we are there to give the
sense of sin. Commit it by all means, but know that you are committing a
sin.'
Isn't that bad law, like the law against smoking in bars, which I hear is
widely disregarded?
'Listen. I am smoker, but this is another matter. It goes much further. The
language of a people is its soul. If you love your country, you must love
your language. It is the fundamental intellectual patrimony. It is what
determines, to a large extent, your identity. And as perpetual secretary of
the <ORGANIZATION>Academie Francaise</ORGANIZATION>, it is I who am in the vanguard.'
But, of necessity, behind the rest of the country?
'Mais, No]'
I compared the Academie Francaise with the <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Druon</PERSON> talked of the
four great institutions of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> before the first world war. The one that
had not survived, he said, was the general staff of the German army. I did
not understand the French phrase so the academicien went to the bookshelf
and plucked out <PERSON>Harrap</PERSON>'s dictionary, screwing a monocle into his eye to read
the entry for me.
As a writer (he told me he had sold 11m copies of his books in <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> alone)
<PERSON>Druon</PERSON> is concerned not just with words, but with syntax. And the
Anglo-Saxons, he said, were losing control of their syntax.
Do you mean that thought itself suffers when syntax goes?
'Yes. Ah, yes.'
And political ideas will become more banal?
'The political question is the ability of the new generations to construct
and express their thought in proper sentences.' The importance of the
message impelled him back into French: 'You cannot dissociate words from
thoughts. And it's to preserve this quality of the formation of ideas that
we conserve French, a language which is analytic, precise and clear. We
don't want it to lose its clarity.
'If we get to the point of using false English words in French, that is the
height of degradation. Another idea: it is not good for the world, for
humanity, to have only one language, because that language will not keep
itself pure.'
Isn't that to overstate what's happening?
'Wait. A sole language, a uniformity, a pidgin angloricain spreading over
the planet. It's very bad. We need different languages. If there is no
difference there is no melange or confrontation of cultures. New ideas will
not be born.'
Can we not have horizontal boundaries between languages - the peasant
speaking his patois, the bourgeois his demotic, the international civil
servant speaking English? 'I'm no more in agreement with you. The human
spirit must have a language that transcends all levels and specialities.
'Look, I'm an old Anglophile. I should not want English and French to be
enemies, but allies. Because they are both carriers by nature of the values
of liberty and dignity. So we needn't deprive ourselves of either.'
Most countries, I said, manage without linguistic laws and academies. What
makes <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> so different?
'Ah, ca] Perhaps because we are the oldest nation in the world with the
sentiment of nationhood. Also because the instrument we have forged, the
linguistic instrument, became the lingua franca of the 18th and 19th
centuries. All the countries of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION> excepted, were
intellectual provinces of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. But this is because of the quality of our
language.'
I tried one last shot: it has fewer words, I believe.
'Dare I say, you have less syntax. And besides - I don't want to be
disagreeable - if English has had some success it is because it is the
easiest language to speak badly.' He gave another wheezy chuckle.
That, perhaps, is its great advantage, I said. But you say English, too,
needs preserving?
'Yes.'
What shall we lose if we don't create an academie anglaise? The power of
literary expression?
'No, your soul.'
The perpetual secretary laughed. There was no reply.

   The voice of authority speaks with a synthesized tongue.
   The Language Master 4000 Speaking Dictionary from <ORGANIZATION>Franklin
Computer Corporation</ORGANIZATION> will tell you what it means, how to spell it,
and how to say it.
   Small dictionary-thesaurus or spell-checking computers, often
with extra calculating and storage functions, make up a new
category of electronic gadgets aimed at students, writers, and
other language-conscious consumers. They range from a <MONEY>$60</MONEY> spell
checker offered by <ORGANIZATION>Seiko</ORGANIZATION> to the Language Master, which sells for
about <MONEY>$400</MONEY>.
   They come basically in two sizes: the larger such as the
Language Master or <ORGANIZATION>Smith Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s Spell-Right 200 are about the
size of a paperback book, while smaller models, like the Smith
Corona Spell-Right 310P or the <ORGANIZATION>Seiko WP</ORGANIZATION> 4000 fit in the palm of the
hand, about the size of a snapshot. All feature typewriter keyboard
layouts.
   The Language Master, weighing just under 12 ounces, has a
frog-like, synthesized voice. It includes a dictionary, thesaurus
and phonetic spelling corrector. It can distinguish between
identically spelled words with different meanings and
pronunciations. The synthesized voice tells you the difference
between ``desert'' (last syllable accent, verb), meaning to
abandon, and ``desert`` (first syllable accent, noun), meaning dry,
barren region.
   If set to talking, the synthesized voice could recite its entire
vocabulary in more than 21 hours of uninterrupted speech. It
contains over 274,000 definitions and spellings of more than 83,000
words from Merriam-Webster's dictionary.
   The thesaurus has 487,000 synonyms for more than 40,000 entries
from <ORGANIZATION>Merriam-Webster</ORGANIZATION>'s Collegiate Thesaurus. Enter a word on the
keyboard, and its various thesaurus definitions appear on your
computer screen. Say you want to look up ``stirring.'' Write it in,
and the computer returns properly inflected synonyms _ ``arousing,
awakening, bestirring.'' Then press the ``say'' key, and you'll
hear the word pronounced electronically.
   The program has an advanced vocabulary-building tutorial that
includes 3,300 words often found on SAT, <ORGANIZATION>GRE</ORGANIZATION> and GMAT exams. It
uses the SAT word list in a variety of word games.
   <ORGANIZATION>Smith Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s Spell-Right 200, selling for about <MONEY>$160</MONEY>, is a
less expensive version of the larger format. It covers 100,000
dictionary entries, has a thesaurus, a spell function that corrects
misspelled words, provides synonyms, and alerts the user to
commonly confused words, displaying their definitions. It has a
built-in calculator which can solve math problems, a foreign
currency converter, and address book storage capacity of 6,000
characters. The unit also has crossword entries, works out
anagrams, and offers a word-guessing game called Hangman.
   The company's two pocket-size checkes, the Spell-Right 300P and
310P, priced at about <MONEY>$140</MONEY> and <MONEY>$150</MONEY> respectively, have many of the
same functions in units with displays located in fold-down covers,
making them look like miniature laptop computers. The 300P checks
spelling, while the 310P additionally provides definitions for
50,000 words and has a word game called Skill that randomly flashes
words followed by their definitions. Both have thesaurus,
calculator and word game functions.
   <ORGANIZATION>Seiko</ORGANIZATION>'s WP-4000 in the smaller format is a dictionary-thesaurus
with 90,000 definitions, 500,000 synonyms and a 95,000-word spell
checker, based on <ORGANIZATION>Roget</ORGANIZATION>'s thesaurus and the <ORGANIZATION>American Heritage</ORGANIZATION>
dictionary. One of its keys lets users scroll through the memory.
This unit sells for around <MONEY>$185</MONEY>.
   Also in the <ORGANIZATION>Seiko</ORGANIZATION> line are the WP-1000, a spell checker with an
85,000-word vocabulary, selling for <MONEY>$60</MONEY>, and the WP-3000 spell
checker-thesaurus with a 170,000-word vocabulary and 240,000
synonyms, priced at about <MONEY>$135</MONEY>.
   The instrument format has been extended to foreign language
translation by <ORGANIZATION>Seiko</ORGANIZATION>, which offers four bilingual translators. The
TR-1100 (French) and TR-1300 (Spanish) each have 40,000-word
vocabularies while larger models TR-1200 (French) and TR-1400
(Spanish) have 80,000-word vocabularies. These pocket-size cards
can translate both to and from English. If the user misspells a
word, the unit will guess at the translation, adding a question
mark on the display. A comma will appear if there or multiple
meanings or synonyms. The translators have scrolling and word
locating functions, as well as a backspace key for erasing errors.
Each unit operates as a calculator and currency exchanger. The
smaller models sell for around <MONEY>$90</MONEY>, and the larger for about <MONEY>$120</MONEY>.

   In <PERSON>Mr. Webster</PERSON>'s first definition, a hyphen is used to divide or
join words or parts of words. Thus, from the start, a hyphen is
expected to be both a divider and a unifier, which is why the
stylebook of the <ORGANIZATION>Oxford University Press</ORGANIZATION> warns, ``If you take the
hyphen seriously, you will surely go mad.''
   A hyphen also is expected to help avoid confusion, ambiguity,
absurdity, even insult. It treads on treacherous turf. Think of the
thin line that is crossed should you drop a hyphen from a
small-business man, who is not a midget.
   According to ``The Story of English,'' there are about 2,700
languages in the world, and, as with death and taxes, one assumes
the hyphen gets to most or many of them.
   More people speak Chinese than any other language, but English
is used in the most countries and, with the orbiting impact of
television and radio, comes closest to being the planetary
language. Thus, le snacque-barre found its way to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> and, like
seksapil, dzhin-in-tonik surfaced in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>.
   Clearly, the hyphen is not exclusively an American or capitalist
problem, although the Chinese might be suggesting that. <PERSON>Baden Baden</PERSON>
may have escaped but not <LOCATION>Bosnia-Hercegovina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>, which
belonged to <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION> until the Hapsburgs took it in <DATE>1908</DATE> and made it
part of the schizoid Austro-Hungarian Empire where the same man
ruled as emperor on one side of the hyphen and king on the other
and commanded different prime ministers in both.
   In <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, whether the Tories or Socialists are in, a woman
with enough money or social clout joins her name to her husband's
with a hyphen. So might an insurance company and a fertilizer firm
in the current contagion of corporate mergers.
   <PERSON>Mao Tse-Tung</PERSON> is now <PERSON>Mao Zedong</PERSON> because the Chinese officially
changed the English phonetic spelling of Chinese names, which
caused a severe drop in the hyphen market. Revolutionary
governments tend to shed the clothes of their colonial masters.
   Ours did. ``Our honor requires us to have a system of our own,
in language as well as government,'' <PERSON>Noah Webster</PERSON> wrote before
publication of his ``American Dictionary of the English Language''
in <DATE>1828</DATE>.
   We may have gone too far, as in a ``pre-dawn vertical
insertion,'' which was the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>'s contribution to the
language of <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Keats</PERSON> to announce a parachute drop in
<LOCATION>Grenada</LOCATION>.
   Through the ages, language moves with an inexorable force that
brushes aside teachers, linguists, critics and other unlicensed
arbiters. It gathers new words, it buries rejects, it accepts the
unacceptable.
   So it is with hyphens. Popular use tends to become proper use.
With time, two words eventually become one after a period of
hyphenation. Relentlessly, bed chamber snuggled into bed-chamber
until it became bedchamber.
   Stylists in the <ORGANIZATION>American South</ORGANIZATION> were in the vanguard of the
trend. Far more than a century ago, they made one word out of two,
as in damnyankee.

<HL> Law: Oxford Reference Will Trace Lineage Of Legal Language --- Publisher, University Plan New, Broader Dictionary On Law Rivaling Black's </HL>

   Lawyers searching for the perfect word will have a new reference work available -- at least by the middle of the next decade. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>University of Texas</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Oxford University Press</ORGANIZATION> announced plans to publish the <ORGANIZATION>Oxford Law Dictionary</ORGANIZATION>, which will trace the evolution of legal language in English from its earliest known uses in the <DATE>16th century</DATE>. 

   Research is expected to take more than six years and keep eight full-time staff members busy at the newly established <ORGANIZATION>University of Texas/Oxford Center for Legal Lexicography</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION>. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Oxford Law Dictionary</ORGANIZATION> will compete in a market dominated by <ORGANIZATION>Black</ORGANIZATION>'s Law Dictionary, first published in <DATE>1891</DATE>, long the standard reference work in the field. 

   According to <PERSON>Bryan A. Garner</PERSON>, who will serve as editor in chief, the <ORGANIZATION>Oxford Law Dictionary</ORGANIZATION> takes a broader historical approach than its competitors. 
Entries will include quotations from each historical period demonstrating how the use of the word evolved over the years. 
In addition, words such as "law review" that don't appear in any dictionary but are nonetheless part of a lawyer's jargon will be included, said <PERSON>Mr. Garner</PERSON>. 

   Many law librarians say that there is room for another law dictionary. 
"Items we expect to be in <ORGANIZATION>Black</ORGANIZATION>'s are sometimes nowhere to be found," said <PERSON>Margaret Davenport</PERSON>, a law librarian at the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> law firm <ORGANIZATION>Cahill Gordon &amp; Reindel</ORGANIZATION>. 
"Black's is a good book, but it needs improvement. 
Oxford could move in." 

   "Black's is recognized world-wide as the leading dictionary for law, and we will compete aggressively. 
It's too early to say what the market for the <ORGANIZATION>Oxford</ORGANIZATION> dictionary as a competitor to Black's will be," said a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Minneapolis-based West Publishing Co.</ORGANIZATION>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION>Black's</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Oxford's new law dictionary will be the first historical dictionary published by <ORGANIZATION>Oxford University Press</ORGANIZATION> outside the <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Garner</PERSON> will also serve as director of the center for legal lexicography and as a visiting law professor at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Texas</ORGANIZATION>. 
Last year <ORGANIZATION>Oxford University Press</ORGANIZATION> published <PERSON>Mr. Garner</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage</ORGANIZATION>.

   Ancient Language Is Given
   An Unusual Refurbishing
   To Rid Foreign Influence

   REYKJAVIK, Iceland -- The Icelandic language has two Old
English letters and far too many new English words. At least
that's the view of many Icelanders, who dislike foreign
phrases cluttering up their ancient tongue. To slow the
spread of "jogurt" and "hamborgarar," Icelanders now are
purging their vocabulary by finding old words for new things.
   Icelandic has changed so little in the past 800 years that
"some parts of the sagas could have been written this
morning," says Baldar Jonsson, head of the Icelandic Language
Institute. But the Vikings didn't have computers. Modern
Icelanders do. They call them "tolva," a merger of two
medieval words, meaning "numbers prophetess." The word for
telephone, "simi," translates as "long thread." A military
tank is "skrithdreki," or "crawling dragon."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Iceland</LOCATION> now has committees grappling with foreign phrases
in 30 fields, from aviation to physics. Amateur wordsmiths
often send in ideas of their own. It is a task for which
Icelanders are well-suited. Per capita, <LOCATION>Iceland</LOCATION> has more
bookstores and Trivial Pursuit games than any nation in the
world. Long, dark winters also afford ample time for
brainstorming.
   <LOCATION>Iceland</LOCATION> isn't alone in fighting to keep its language pure.
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> has long done battle with "Franglais," but linguistic
patriotism is hard to enforce in such a big and cosmopolitan
land.
   In remote, sea-locked <LOCATION>Iceland</LOCATION>, the war against Icelish
appears more successful. New words are published in journals
and quickly filter out through classrooms, dictionaries and
the media. In a society of only 250,000 people, it doesn't
take long for word to travel, and to catch on.
   <PERSON>Mr. Jonsson</PERSON> helped compose two words for AIDS. One is
"alnaemi," which roughly translates as "sensitive to
everything." The other is "eythni," derived from an old verb
meaning "to squander."
   <PERSON>Kirstin Flygenring</PERSON>, an economist, is combing <PERSON>William
Branson</PERSON>'s "Macroeconomic Theory," listing terms such as
"liquidity trap" for which Icelandic substitutes are needed.
Sometimes, a literal translation will do. The "gross" in
gross national product, for instance, is easily derived from
an Icelandic word meaning "polluted" or "unfiltered." But
colloquialisms don't translate so easily. <LOCATION>Iceland</LOCATION> doesn't
have junk bonds or greenmail (or even a stock exchange), and
"putting some of these words into Icelandic can make them
confusing and a little silly," <PERSON>Ms. Flygenring</PERSON> says.
   In a related campaign, Icelanders also are weeding out
foreign names. Traditionally, Icelanders have been known by
first names only, followed by a patronymic; hence, <PERSON>Jon</PERSON>, the
son of Thor, is <PERSON>Jon Thorsson</PERSON>, and his sister's last name is
Thorssdottir. <LOCATION>Iceland</LOCATION>'s slim phone book is alphabetized by
first names, and Icelanders rarely use <PERSON>Mr. or Mrs.</PERSON>, except
when traveling abroad.
   But over the past century, many Icelanders have taken
middle names and also adopted non-Icelandic surnames. To stem
this tide, <LOCATION>Iceland</LOCATION>'s parliament, or Althing, is expected to
toughen an existing ban on non-Icelandic surnames and also to
establish a formal list of acceptable forenames.
   "Names are part of our language and if we lose them we
lose our history," says <PERSON>Guthrun Kvaran</PERSON>, who is drafting the
law. While aimed at preserving tradition, the law also
acknowledges modern trends. Children born out of wedlock will
be able to take their mother's name.
   Immigrants who become Icelandic citizens also must take
new names and pass them on to their children. Hence, a
Vietnamese refugee named <PERSON>Tran Dat Phat</PERSON> now is <PERSON>Petur Tran Dat
Phat</PERSON>, and his children take the name Petursson or
Petursdottir.
   One notable exception to this rule is <PERSON>Vladimir Ashkenazy</PERSON>,
the Soviet pianist and conductor who was allowed to keep his
name after becoming an Icelander. (His wife is Icelandic, but
he now spends more of his time in <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>.)
   The <PERSON>Ashkenazy</PERSON> case inspired a Spanish immigrant in
<LOCATION>Reykjavik</LOCATION>, unhappy at having to adopt an Icelandic name, to
lodge a bizarre protest. As the Russian pianist's name was
now an approved Icelandic moniker, the <ORGANIZATION>Spaniard</ORGANIZATION> announced
that he wanted to take <PERSON>Vladimir Ashkenazy</PERSON> as his name, too.
Officials were amused but unmoved.

<HL> Letters to the Editor: Let's Swear Off Vulgar Language </HL>
<SO> </SO>
<TEXT>
   Re <PERSON>Robert Perrin</PERSON>'s <DATE>Sept. 27</DATE> editorial-page article "There's Too Darn Much Cussing in This Goshdang Society": I agree wholeheartedly with his contention that there is too much use of vulgar language in this country. 
In fact, I would go as far as to say that the amount of this vile talk is detrimental to our language as a whole, for it perverts the very fabric that makes up the English language. 

   By this I mean that the use of obscenities is almost always used in place of a more appropriate word that is not obscene and is better fitting. 
What we have so graciously called "four-letter words" are nothing more than a crutch for those who do not know how to use the English language correctly or those who do not want to use it correctly. 
In either case, I am afraid that we are cheapening our native tongue as well as robbing ourselves and our children of the opportunity to speak both eloquently and succinctly. 
This is a sad happening for all in our society and need not be. 

   <PERSON>Charles F. Edris</PERSON>
   <LOCATION>Boca Raton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>.
   ---
   Three cheers for <PERSON>Mr. Perrin</PERSON>'s article. 
I regret the increased incidence of "blue" language. 
I suppose every language has its expletives and they probably all relate -- people being people -- to the same body parts and functions. 
But these expletives should be reserved for occasions calling for a cuss. 
When they permeate all conversations, they lose their intrinsic value and our language is that much weaker. 

   People who believe language represents values have put up with this assault too long. 

   <PERSON>Robert Marquis</PERSON>
   <LOCATION>Princeton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>

   I am so happy to see an article like this written by a man. 
Perhaps articles such as <PERSON>Mr. Perrin</PERSON>'s will help to get across the message that profanity is just a sad excuse for a poor vocabulary.

SPOTTING FAVORITES IN A LITERARY ZOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER, TIMES BOOK CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The State of the Language edited by <PERSON>Christopher Ricks</PERSON> and <PERSON>Leonard Michaels</PERSON> 
(<ORGANIZATION>University of California Press</ORGANIZATION>, 531 pages). 
</P>
<P>
Opening this book is like opening the zoo gates to an impatient crowd. 
Sixty-two writers tumble in, each invited to put down thoughts about some 
aspect -- any aspect -- of the English language at the start of our century's 
last decade. Naturally they scatter, each to his favorite species, though the 
insectivorursus (bugbear) seems most popular. 
</P>
<P>
Each to his? Each to her? Each to his/her? Each to their? Predictably, 
language's conquests and casualties in the gender wars are a prominent theme. 
So is the language used to speak or write about AIDS. So are questions of 
language and race, language and class, language and the nature of reality. 
Literary reality, that is, and also real reality. 
</P>
<P>
These are the most political topics -- language as power -- and I will get back 
to them. But to get to them risks getting swallowed up by them -- this is an 
open zoo -- so before doing so, let me give an idea of the range and variety of 
the collection. 
</P>
<P>
It is the second "State of the Language." The first was edited 10 years ago by 
<PERSON>Christopher Ricks</PERSON> and <PERSON>Leonard Michaels</PERSON>, English writers and English teachers 
at, respectively, <ORGANIZATION>Boston University</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>. It was a flaming success -- 
we seem as fascinated to know we are speaking English as <ORGANIZATION>Moliere</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>M. Jourdain</PERSON> 
was to know he was speaking prose -- and this new volume by 60 new writers is 
the result. Ricks and <PERSON>Michaels</PERSON> are repeaters. 
</P>
<P>
There are pieces, for example, on Australian English and graffiti English and 
one by <PERSON>Michael Bawtree</PERSON> suggesting that if the English opera tradition is 
relatively weak, it is in part because Shakespeare and others gave such glory 
to theater words that they refused subsequently to lie down and let the music 
upstage them. 
</P>
<P>
There is a piece on the contributions of Variety newspaper to the language: 
palooka, corny, blockbuster, deejay, among others. There is a piece on swear 
words by an <ORGANIZATION>Oxford</ORGANIZATION> don that has this reviewer trying to choose between "jocular 
ponderousness" and "ponderous jocularity." 
</P>
<P>
There is a piece on the use of pidgin in advertising in the <LOCATION>South Seas</LOCATION>. There 
are Wall Street folk terms for particular stocks: Kellogg is cornflakes; 
<PERSON>MacDonald</PERSON>'s, we are told, is murderburger, and <PERSON>Simmons Mattress</PERSON> is American 
playground. I don't know if I believe this <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT>, but I <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> want to. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the pieces wander freely. <PERSON>M.F.K. Fisher</PERSON> writes of a pornography ring at 
her boarding school and <PERSON>Ted Hughes</PERSON> contributes a poem. An essay on poets' 
letters tells us that <PERSON>Anne Sexton</PERSON>, taken aback when a monk she was 
corresponding with said he was leaving the monastery and wanted to meet her, 
replied: "I feel I have somehow deceived you into thinking this is really a 
human relationship. It is a letter relationship between humans . . . " 
</P>
<P>
If words can deceive us into passion, they can also help us out of it. Ricks 
tells of smashing a window years ago in a marital dispute. A constable, 
summoned to the scene, was politely sympathetic: "We got a phone call, sir, 
telling us that someone has gone beresk." Suddenly, <PERSON>Ricks</PERSON>' misery lifted. That 
beresk got him well out of life and back in literature with <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION>'s 
malaprop <ORGANIZATION>Dogberry</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
On to language as power. Our disputes about ideas and issues tend to become 
disputes about terminology. Like Humpty Dumpty we want the mastery over words 
in order to gain mastery over their meaning. As <PERSON>Michaels</PERSON> writes in his 
foreword, it is not so much a question of using language as of being used by 
it: 
</P>
<P>
"Until recently, it was considered very good luck to be used by English . . . 
There are now quite a few Englishes, and formerly colonized people may well 
prefer to get free of them and be used by their own language." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>David Dabydeen</PERSON> writes convincingly of the need for black writers in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> to 
use their own kind of speech. A literary tradition in which an 18th-Century 
English poet was able to refer to plantation overseers as Master Swains, and to 
slaves as assistant planters clearly needs help. He gives a splendid quote from 
the <ORGANIZATION>Creole</ORGANIZATION> poet <PERSON>John Agard</PERSON>: 
</P>
<P>
"Dem accuse me of assault/on de <ORGANIZATION>Oxford</ORGANIZATION> dictionary/imagine a concise peaceful 
man like me," he writes. 
</P>
<P>
"I ent serving no jail sentence/I slashing suffix in self-defense/I bashing 
future wit present tense." 
</P>
<P>
Bashing the future with the present tense describes him perfectly. Several 
pieces refer to the terminology of AIDS. One writer notes the controversy over 
the term "AIDS victims." "People with AIDS" is preferred by many, as tending 
less to segregate the sufferers. Others object to this as linguistic cottage 
cheese. 
</P>
<P>
The feminist movement has provided the liveliest disputes. What does one do 
about the relative pronoun? The writer who sticks up for . . . his . . . her . 
. . their . . . his/her . . . convictions is to do what? Half a dozen essayists 
weigh in, none comfortably. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Margaret Anne Doody</PERSON> is spirited, in any case, when she objects to line-by-line 
combing-out of church hymnals. Taking out references to king and His risks 
turning the hymns to mush. Better to omit particularly objectionable stanzas, 
she argues, than to do so much rewriting that "we are invited to forget that 
our Christian forefathers and foremothers ever said anything that poses a 
problem."

JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: CAMPUS-SPEAK;

<P>
THE THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE IS NOT THE INSPIRATION FOR COLLEGE SLANG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EVERYONE KNOWS that teen-agers speak a sublanguage of their own. Fewer of us 
are aware, I suspect, that college students similarly develop a slang that 
becomes the common language of campus and dormitory life. 
</P>
<P>
The two languages do not necessarily serve the same purpose: Teen slang makes 
teen conversation unintelligible to adults and thus preserves the teen group's 
privacy. College students are not so threatened by the immediate presence of 
their parents, so we must assume that the purpose of their slang is to improve 
and invigorate the language. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Pamela Munro</PERSON>, professor of linguistics at <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>, has sent me a book, "UCLA 
Slang: A <ORGANIZATION>Dictionary of Slang Words</ORGANIZATION> and Expressions Used at <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>," which was 
compiled by a dedicated class she taught. (It is for sale for <MONEY>$5</MONEY> at the <ORGANIZATION>UCLA 
Book Store</ORGANIZATION>.) 
</P>
<P>
Glancing through it, I infer that slang is indispensable to campus life and 
reflects its nature: There are more expressions for drunkenness, throwing up 
and sex than for any other activities. 
</P>
<P>
That does not mean, I suspect, that college youths are more given to strong 
drink than the general population, -- though they may be, and being less 
experienced, they may be more likely to throw up. There are more synonyms for 
drunk in the English language than for any other. 
</P>
<P>
Among the printable words for drunk, for example, are blasted, blitzed, bombed, 
ripped, shredded, slaughtered, blown and blotto. You will notice that some of 
them -- like bombed and blotto -- are in the general language and have been for 
a long time. 
</P>
<P>
There is a plethora of demeaning epithets: animal, a wild, crazy person; 
airhead, a dumbbell; beddy, a promiscuous woman; bub, a person with no 
redeeming qualities; <PERSON>Chester Molester</PERSON>, a lecherous man; scary, unattractive, 
repulsive. Also newt, nerd, kook and dweeb, most of which are in the general 
language and define an inept, stupid wimp. 
</P>
<P>
There is no shortage of words meaning to have sex. A few of the printable ones: 
boink, bump, jock, jump and romp. Whether those represent a high incidence of 
sex on campus or merely a high incidence of thinking about it, we can only 
imagine. They do seem to reflect macho male attitudes toward the practice. 
</P>
<P>
A curious phenomenon in the dictionary is the incidence of formal, rather 
out-of-date words that have been revived in their original sense. For example, 
strumpet (a sleazy girl) and inebriated (drunk). Prof. <PERSON>Munro</PERSON> notes that such 
words have returned to life only on campus. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, other standard words have completely novel definitions in 
campus use. For example, grovel means "to make out," and wrap means 
"girlfriend." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the slang expressions seem childish but rather graphic. "To give 
someone cavities" is to talk excessively sweetly to him or her. To "shake one's 
skirt" is to dance. 
</P>
<P>
"Coke-bottle eyes" is a condition brought on by excessive drink in which all 
members of the opposite sex appear desirable (a not uncommon phenomenon in 
post-collegiate life.) 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the words describing persons are derogatory -- geek, an idiot; 
loon, a weird person; lump, a useless, lazy person -- there are a few words of 
admiration: A goddess is a female achiever, and a god is a gorgeous male, 
although that word also is used in "bow to the porcelain god," meaning to throw 
up. An Adonis is an extremely good-looking male. 
</P>
<P>
Many words and phrases, of course, are related to studies and tests, which 
presumably are sandwiched in between the boozing, barfing and bumping. Most of 
them are in the general language, which suggests that the students are not very 
inventive in academic areas. To ace a test is to pass it with flying colors; to 
mess up is to fail; a mick is an easy class; murder is very difficult. 
</P>
<P>
I find few words of genius, and few that seem to have any chance of survival. 
Undoubtedly today's slang is tomorrow's English; but I can't say that today's 
<ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> slang will enrich or invigorate the language of tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
Prof. <PERSON>Munro</PERSON> assures us in her introduction that "almost all <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> students have 
a full command of standard English, which they use in writing papers and 
talking with older people." 
</P>
<P>
So don't despair.

<TEXT>
   This year's presidential campaign
between Republican <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON> has
made little contribution to the English language, say editors at
Merriam-Webster dictionaries.
   ``It's been dull,'' said senior editor <PERSON>James G. Lowe</PERSON>, whose
lexicographers have been keeping close tabs on campaign rhetoric in
hopes of finding new words.
   Since the days of ``caucus,'' an Algonquin Indian term that
entered the American political vocabulary in the <DATE>1760s</DATE>, and down
through ``mugwump,'' ``power broker,'' ``suffragette,''
``smoke-filled rooms,'' ``arm-twisting,'' ``wheeler-dealer'' and
``dirty tricks,'' national politics and particularily presidential
campaigns have been a rich source of new words, he said.
   Although the candidates have revived some old terms, such as
``limousine liberal,'' coined by <PERSON>Mario Procaccino</PERSON> during his <DATE>1969</DATE>
campaign against <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>John Lindsay</PERSON>, they have come
up with little new.
   With only a few weeks of the campaign left, <PERSON>Lowe</PERSON> sees only
``scam'' used as a combining term _ as in ``Iranscam,''
``Contrascam,'' ``debatescam'' _ as enduring and ``pastel
patriotism'' as a possible starter.
   According to one version, ``pastel patriots'' were what the
Republicans called the Democrats for decorating their convention
arena not in traditional red, white and blue but in hues that
looked red, white and blue on television.
   ``I don't know whether to blame their speech writers, but the
candidates haven't been talking about issues,'' said <PERSON>Lowe</PERSON>, pointing
out that this campaign is devoid of New Deals, Square Deals,
Hoovervilles and frontiers of any kind.
   ``Their forte is one-liners,'' he said. ``It's a quick way of
getting attention, but as soon as the campaign is over those
one-liners will be forgotten.''
   Even the press has been uninspired, according to <PERSON>Lowe</PERSON>.
   ``It's very often the journalists that invent words,'' <PERSON>Lowe</PERSON>
said. ``Time and <ORGANIZATION>Newsweek</ORGANIZATION> magazines, because of their breezy style
and need to condense information, have been particularily fertile
sources for us over the years. But not in this campaign.''
   A new word gets into <PERSON>Webster</PERSON>'s simply by being used repeatedly
in newspapers, magazines and other contemporary writing. Lowe's
staff spends most of its time reading and noting new words and new
uses on citation cards, and when a term builds up sufficient
citations over an extended period of time, it is added to the
dictionary.
   The test involves being more than a one-campaign phenomenon,
such as former Vice President <PERSON>Spiro Agnew</PERSON>'s ``radiclib,'' which
quickly amassed a pile of citations following his <DATE>1970</DATE> speech and
has been heard little since.
   The <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> years in general have provided slim linguistic
pickings, <PERSON>Lowe</PERSON> said. Two terms that have stuck and moved beyond
their political origins are ``exit poll,'' which came into popular
use in <DATE>1980</DATE> when <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> television viewers learned before their
polls closed that <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> had defeated <PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON>, and ``yuppy,''
which blossomed with <PERSON>Colorado Sen. Gary Hart</PERSON>'s campaign for the
Democratic nomination in <DATE>1984</DATE>.
   Not only has the current crop of candidates added little to the
vocabulary, Republican vice presidential hopeful <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON> even
tried, unsuccessfully, to get <PERSON>Webster</PERSON>'s to delete a word.
   Quayle took offense last year at supplementary definitions for
the word ``hoosier'' in the <ORGANIZATION>Third New International Dictionary</ORGANIZATION>,
which pointed out that besides referring to a resident of <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>,
the noun can refer to an ``awkward, unhandy or unskilled person.''
As a verb the word can mean ``to loaf or botch a job.''
   Quayle suggested the dictionary company define ``hoosier'' as
``someone who is quick, smart, resourceful, skillful, a winner.''
   <PERSON>William A. Llewellyn</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Merriam-Webster</ORGANIZATION>, declined to
revise the dictionary entry. He pointed out that many words have
more than one meaning and ``we in the dictionary business cannot
arbitrarily decide that we will enter only one of those senses.''
   ``Dictionary makers do not truly define words,'' <PERSON>Llewellyn</PERSON> said.
``Rather, they record the language as it is used.''

<TEXT>
<P>
Most readers have responded with censure or reservations to my comment on 
"There Is No Zoo in Zoology," by <PERSON>Charles Harrington Elster</PERSON>, an admittedly 
"opinionated" guide to correct pronunciation. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, as I said, I mentioned words that I myself had evidently been 
mispronouncing, according to <PERSON>Elster</PERSON>'s dicta, among them aqua, coupon, daiquiri, 
guillotine and piquant. 
</P>
<P>
I have always said AWK-wa, not AK-wa, as recommended by <PERSON>Elster</PERSON>; KYOO-pahn, not 
KOO-pahn; DAK-uh-ree, not DY-kuh-ree; GEE-uh-teen, not GIL-uh-teen; and 
pee-KHANT, not PEE-kint. 
</P>
<P>
Bill <ORGANIZATION>Dekle of Sherman Oaks</ORGANIZATION> says that if <PERSON>Elster</PERSON> hopes to homogenize the English 
language he won't succeed. "Thank goodness it'll never happen. What a boring 
place it would be." 
</P>
<P>
Elster, of course, realizes that pronunciation varies according to class, 
region and other factors, but he has sought to validate the pronunciations 
agreed on by most dictionaries and other authorities. 
</P>
<P>
That <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON> said <PERSON>Cuber</PERSON> did not make it right; that <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> said nucular did 
not make it right. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Daniel Burnham</PERSON> of Bishop expresses disappointment in me for appearing to agree 
with <PERSON>Elster</PERSON>. "In more interesting and adventurous times," he says, "everyone 
was his own arbiter in matters of spelling and pronunciation. Now, 
unfortunately, we're all at the mercy of professional tastemakers and 
intellectual storm troopers." 
</P>
<P>
I think <PERSON>Burnham</PERSON>'s alarm is unfounded. Listen to any broadcast or talk show and 
you must conclude that the language is in anarchy. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Patrick Groff</PERSON>, professor at <LOCATION>San Diego State</LOCATION>, reports that his <ORGANIZATION>Random House 
Dictionary</ORGANIZATION> of the English Language (<DATE>1983</DATE>) permits AKH-wa, DAK-uh-ree, 
GEE-u-teen, pee-KHANT, VAL-ay and for-TAY. 
</P>
<P>
One of <PERSON>Elster</PERSON>'s sources, by the way, was the <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION>, but his choices 
evidently were based on a consensus. Some readers seem to have misunderstood 
<PERSON>Elster</PERSON> on valet. His point was that valet had long since been Anglicized into 
VAL-it, which is correct; but that to pronounce it VAL-it would seem pedantic, 
since VAL-ay is so entrenched. I said I would continue to say VAL-it, since I 
considered VAL-ay an affectation. 
</P>
<P>
D. <PERSON>G. Bradford</PERSON> wonders, if <PERSON>Elster</PERSON> thinks VAL-it is correct, whether we should 
also pronounce bouquet as boo-KWET, sachet as sash-ET, filet as fil-ET, and 
gourmet as gour-MET. Oddly, she notes, we have anglicized banquet. Fil-et is 
also heard. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>David P. Lewis</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Sherman Oaks</LOCATION> scoffs at <LOCATION>Elster</LOCATION>'s AK-wa for aqua. "I have been 
around for 70-plus years, have lived in four major American regions and have 
visited every state in the <LOCATION>Union</LOCATION> except <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, and I can assure him and you 
that the overwhelming majority of Americans say AHK-wuh, and will continue to 
do so." (Me, too.) 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> also thinks people will go on saying for-TAY, for forte, because it is 
not ambiguous. "We know when we hear for-TAY that the speaker isn't referring 
to a rampart of some kind." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Block agrees that forte pronounced as one syllable "would be thought of as 
a place to hide from the Indians. Eventually, forte will be accepted as a 
two-syllable word, even by pedants." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Charles M. Cobb</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Agoura Hills</LOCATION> says <PERSON>Elster</PERSON> may have wit and opinion, but 
little scholarship. "Every linguist knows that language is dynamic and flexible 
and that pronunciation is a function of space and time, not of something called 
'correctness.' A dictionary is not a lawgiver; it is a reporter." 
</P>
<P>
Our language might be more colorful if one of <PERSON>Elster</PERSON>'s sources had been "How to 
Talk Pure Ozark," by <PERSON>Dale Freeman</PERSON>, a glossary of the language as spoken in the 
southern highlands. 
</P>
<P>
In this hardy dialect, bag is used as in "He bagged her to marry up with him"; 
banch as in "scrubs sit on the banch"; dork, what it gets when the sun goes 
down; flar, a rose is about the prettiest flar there is; hern, it ain't hern, 
it's hisn; jav, did you have? keeyow, a farm animal; oral, your car needs two 
quarts of oral; rah cheer, he was born rah cheer; retch, as in "If I'd knowed 
it was you I'd have retch out and wove." 
</P>
<P>
Ozark evidently has no words for aqua, valet and piquant.

<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SUCCESS of <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION> mathematician <PERSON>Alan Turing</PERSON> as a code-breaker is one
of the legends of the second world war. Around <DATE>1944</DATE>, when the German naval
codes had all been cracked decisively by the government code and cypher
school at <LOCATION>Bletchley</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Buckinghamshire</LOCATION>, Turing had (in the words of his
biographer, <PERSON>Andrew Hodges</PERSON>) 'learned how to build a brain - not an electric
brain, as he might possibly have imagined before the war, but an electronic
brain.'
If Turing were alive today - the harsh English law against homosexual men
led to his untimely death in <DATE>1954</DATE> - he would surely take a well-deserved
pride in the universal labour-saving which the electronic brain he and other
pioneers conceived plays in all our lives. He might have foreseen that it
would revolutionise business and industrial practices, and that it would
take over much of the ground-work in applied mathematics, the engineering
sciences, physics and astronomy; but could he have imagined the inroads it
has now begun to make into the area known traditionally as the humanities?
Some of the most hitherto insoluble problems of authorship have begun to
yield to scrutiny by <ORGANIZATION>Turing</ORGANIZATION>'s electronic brain. The identity of the
acidulous Whig activist who contributed letters to the public prints,
attacking <PERSON>George III</PERSON> and other 18th century worthies under the pseudonym
'<PERSON>Junius</PERSON>,' was one of the earliest pieces of successful, computer-based
research analysing an author's style. Swedish scholar <PERSON>Alvar Ellgard</PERSON>
published his conclusions in A Statistical Method for Determining Authorship
(<DATE>1962</DATE>), where he established the overwhelming probability that the
scurrilous letters were written by Sir <PERSON>Philip Francis</PERSON>, <PERSON>Gibbon</PERSON>'s schoolmaster
and later a civil servant.
Work of this kind where each word and punctuation mark in a text is computed
into lists, charts and graphs designed to show the number of times it is
used in a given type of sentence-formation - plotted against a putative norm
 -once required the resource of a mainframe computer, the kind of machine
available only to a scholar working in some handsomely endowed university
research centre. Now, though, the equipment to undertake such a project is
coming within the reach of anyone with a reasonably efficient modern home
computer.
Many of the <ORGANIZATION>Oxford</ORGANIZATION> dictionaries are now on computer disc and available
commercially to the ordinary 'user'; so are several of the standard texts of
the <ORGANIZATION>Oxford English School</ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>Oxford University Press</ORGANIZATION> has in train an
extensive programme of electronic publishing, as I discovered on a visit to
its headquarters at <ORGANIZATION>Walton Street</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Oxford</ORGANIZATION>.
'Look here upon this picture, and on this . . .' as <ORGANIZATION>Hamlet</ORGANIZATION> says. In this
instance, Picture One depicts 20 heavy, large, dark-blue volumes occupying
4.5 ft of shelf space and costing around Pounds 1,500 for the set (according
to the bargain you strike with your supplier). Picture Two shows what author
<PERSON>Anthony Burgess</PERSON> calls a 'silver beer mat'; in other words, a compact disc.
This particular one costs Pounds 495.00. Both accommodate exactly the same
amount of information - the entire contents of the Oxford English Dictionary
2nd edition (<DATE>1989</DATE>). In the first instance, all you need is a strong pair of
arms and reasonably good eyesight;. in the second, a personal computer (PC)
fitted with a CD-ROM drive.
This is a gadget that extends a computer's memory vastly, necessary when the
machine has to take on board the <ORGANIZATION>OED</ORGANIZATION>'s 500,000 head words, their
definitions, pronunciation, etymology, and the 24m quotations that
illustrate their use in texts since the beginning of English. Many libraries
and institutions have such a drive but most private PC owners do not
(although it is becoming less expensive and is likely to become a standard
option for them fairly soon). To run the <ORGANIZATION>OED</ORGANIZATION> electronically, you also need
to have the <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> system known as Windows (version 3 or above); a
Macintosh version of the OED 2nd edition will be available next <DATE>spring</DATE>.
In this form, the <ORGANIZATION>OED</ORGANIZATION> has become a lexical database. Its users are able to
look up English words in a variety of different ways, not just
alphabetically as before. The entire dictionary may be scanned in less than
a minute to give the answer to abstruse searches. Colonel <PERSON>Pickering</PERSON> in
<LOCATION>Pygmalion</LOCATION> was an authority on spoken Sanskrit and was working with Professor
<PERSON>Higgins</PERSON> on Indian dialect words in English. He would have been overjoyed at
being able to 'wild card' - that is, put an asterisk against typical
end-formations in English of the kind of words in which he was interested
and, within 40 seconds, to have on screen a complete list of all such words
in the dictionary. At a more frivolous level, crossword addicts may use the
wild card command to find words of which they know only certain letters.
There is an obvious benefit in having the OED available in this electronic
form for its editors and compilers; it releases them from an incalculable
amount of donkey work. Looking to the future, the editors now have the task
of preparing the 3rd edition of the OED, scheduled for publication in <DATE>2005</DATE>.
Will there need to be a printed version of the 3rd edition at all or will by
then everyone be using it electronically?
That is a question to which the OUP does not yet know the answer. What is
becoming clear is that the old system of issuing supplements between
editions in order to keep up to date with new words and fresh shades of
meaning can now be abandoned because these neologisms can, as soon as they
are identified, be added to the database.
It is not only lexicography that it is being given a new lease of life by
the computer but classical and literary scholarship as well. Computers have
been aiding scholars in deciphering early languages like Ancient Egyptian
for many years, but now they are moving in force into the study of
literature.
The Americans have a project to put the whole of English poetry, from
<LOCATION>Langland</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Larkin</LOCATION>, on to computer disc, and some classical texts studied in
the <ORGANIZATION>Oxford Greats School</ORGANIZATION> are available as software. The <ORGANIZATION>Bodleian Library</ORGANIZATION> in
<ORGANIZATION>Oxford</ORGANIZATION> has a terminal in the reading room and classics dons at work on
Virgil or <PERSON>Horace</PERSON> can be seen operating it.
The <ORGANIZATION>OUP</ORGANIZATION> has just launched its <ORGANIZATION>Oxford Electronic Texts Library</ORGANIZATION> for English
literature. This consists of The Complete Works of <PERSON>Jane Austen</PERSON> (Pounds 60),
The Riverside Chaucer (Pounds 75), The Poetical Works of <PERSON>Samuel Coleridge</PERSON>
(Pounds 60), and The Poetical Works of <PERSON>William Wordsworth</PERSON> (Pounds 60). These
are all out now, and coming next <DATE>Spring</DATE> will be electronic versions of
<LOCATION>Hardy</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Milton</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mary Shelley</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mary Wollstonecraft</PERSON>.
The controversial modern spelling edition of <PERSON>William Shakespeare</PERSON>: The
Complete Works, edited by <PERSON>Wells</PERSON> and <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> and published in <DATE>1986</DATE>, is now
available to PC users at Pounds 95.
None of these electronic texts has the search functions that are built into
the electronic OED. They offer the standard Oxford texts on diskettes of
regular size in which each line, as well as each page of the text, is
enumerated. Used in combination with a text-analysis software package such
as Micro-OCP (<ORGANIZATION>Oxford Pounds</ORGANIZATION> 175.00), however, you can very easily get your
computer to make searches, word lists, concordances and indexes from them.
What use, though, is it for the person who does not happen to be studying
for a <ORGANIZATION>BA</ORGANIZATION> in English or a B <PERSON>Litt</PERSON> to have such a resource? Clearly, no use at
all. If you just want to sit by the swimming pool and read Northanger Abbey
for fun, you would be much better off with the Worlds Classics paperback.
But it is important, even to such a reader, to have a text as close as
possible to the one approved by the author. Computers can play an important
role in establishing an authentic text and, in some cases, establishing
authorship as well.
A new computer-based literary discipline called Stylology has begun to
emerge in which texts are submitted to computational tests not merely as
part of textual scholarship but also in the hope of arriving at new critical
insights. An outstanding example of this is the book Computation into
Criticsm: A Study of <PERSON>Jane Austen</PERSON>'s Novels and An Experiment in Method by JF
<PERSON>Burrows</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Oxford</ORGANIZATION>, Pounds 25.00). The author, an Australian professor of
English, checked the speech habits of all the main characters in <PERSON>Jane Austen</PERSON>
through an extended series of computer tests and collated them, using
methods borrowed from statistics, to determine variations from normal or
average usage.
Burrows' findings inevitably are the source of much debate in English
faculties. They have been welcomed warmly in an appreciative review by at
least one prominent member of the Oxbridge establishment: <PERSON>Marilyn Butler</PERSON>,
the <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION> professor of English Literature. His charts and graphs of
pronoun usage by <PERSON>Elizabeth Bennett</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr D'Arcy</PERSON> and the rest prove beyond any
doubt (if they prove nothing else) that, in a novel, the distinction made up
to now between the 'grammatical' words said to be inert, and the 'lexical'
words said to be the source of energy, no longer holds. Burrows shows in
innumerable ways how grammatical words are as great a source of fictional
energy as the lexical ones in character building, narrative development etc.
Move over, <PERSON>Dr Leavis</PERSON>, you have had your byte at the cherry. Now let the
computer have its turn.

<LEADPARA>  SEVERAL weeks ago I wrote a column about the need to focus our children's
attention on the precise pronunciation of certain troublesome words, and I
urged parents and teachers to use the month of February to practice the
pronunciation "Feb-roo-ary" (instead of "Feb-yoo-ary").;    I received more
mail about that column, I think, than any other in the Family Learning series.
Most of the letters asked the same question: How can we get children to adopt
the "correct" pronunciation when Webster's Dictionary lists the "Feb-yoo-ary"
form first? Doesn't that mean it is the "preferred" pronunciation?  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     No, it doesn't. But to understand what it does mean, we have to understand
a little more about dictionaries.;    What do you think a dictionary should
do? I mean, when you look up a spelling or a pronunciation or a definition in
a dictionary, do you think that what you are being told is the way a word
should be spelled, pronounced, and used, or are you being told the way that
word is spelled, pronounced, and used by most people most of the time?;   
I'll bet that, like most people, you remember someone telling you that when
there are several spellings or pronunciations for the same word, the
dictionary will always place the "correct" one first -- the one preferred by
the most educated speakers and writers. And, until the early <DATE>1960s</DATE>, this is
exactly what most dictionaries did.;    But then the folks who were writing
"<PERSON>Webster</PERSON>'s Third International Dictionary" decided that it really wasn't their
business to tell people how they should use the English language.;    Their
job, instead, was to create a book that would reveal the way English actually
is commonly used. So, almost all the <PERSON>Webster</PERSON>'s dictionaries from that time on
began placing the "most frequent" spelling of a word in the first position
(even though that form might be listed as a frequent "misspelling" in a school
grammar text) and less frequently used forms later.;    In the same way, the
"most frequent" pronunciations preceded less frequently heard forms. This
created a great debate among lexicographers (those who compile dictionaries),
a debate that is still going on today.;    Some publishers followed the
<PERSON>Webster</PERSON>'s lead and created "descriptive" (some would say "permissive")
dictionaries. Others tried to remain "prescriptive," but then faced the
difficulty of deciding just who should be doing the prescribing, and just why
one form should be more "correct" or "preferred" than another anyway.;    So,
there you have it. What do you think a dictionary should be, "descriptive" or
"prescriptive"? An even better question is, which of these labels applies to
your own dictionary?;    The only way for you to know is to wade through the
introductory pages, which are usually set in microscopic type, and look for a
section titled "Variants." A dictionary can be a wonderful home reference
tool, but you just can't assume that it is telling you one thing when it may
well be telling you something else.;    This is why I urge families to have
their own "family dictionary," and to get to know it by making it a convenient
and frequent part of their living room or family room activities. A "desk
size" or "collegiate size" is ideal -- not one of those
bigger-than-a-breadbox, "unabridged" models that never gets used because no
one can lift it.;    "Prescriptive" dictionaries are no better than
"descriptive" ones. The purpose of each is to help you make an informed choice
about the usages that you choose to adopt for yourself.;    In the end, you
and your children will determine the standards that apply to your own use of
language. You will model your standards, and change those standards again and
again, according to the usages you hear and read.;    And one of the things
you'll read is that first "r" in "<DATE>February</DATE>." What you do about it is all up to
you.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>New Dictionary May Save Language of Alabama Indian Tribe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of linguists is working to save the
language of the <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> Indian tribe of eastern <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, which had no
written grammar or dictionary and was faced with extinction as the
number of speakers dwindled.
   <PERSON>Heather Hardy</PERSON>, an associate professor of English at the
<ORGANIZATION>University of North Texas</ORGANIZATION>, began the project after receiving a
newspaper clipping in <DATE>1980</DATE> about an <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> tribe member who was
using note cards to create a dictionary of her native language.
   <PERSON>Ms. Hardy</PERSON> decided to contact the woman.
   ``I knew not much had been done on the <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>,'' she said.
``When you've got languages in your own back yard that have hardly
been described at all and are dying out, that takes priority.''
   The <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> live with the <LOCATION>Coushatta</LOCATION> tribe on a joint reservation
nestled in the Big Thicket National Preserve, 70 miles northeast of
<LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Ms. Hardy</PERSON> drove to the reservation and found <PERSON>Cora Sylestine</PERSON>, a
former teacher. The two women struck a bargain: <PERSON>Ms. Sylestine</PERSON> would
guide <PERSON>Ms. Hardy</PERSON> through the thickets of her native language if <PERSON>Ms.
Hardy</PERSON> would help her create the dictionary of her dreams.
   First, <PERSON>Ms. Hardy</PERSON> had to create a system of writing to record the
language. And the grammar used by its speakers had to be deciphered
before its words could be broken down for a dictionary.
   <PERSON>Ms. Hardy</PERSON> said the process has been laborious, done on weekends
and school breaks, financed mostly with small grants and personal
funds.
   As of <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE>, though, a team working on the project, which
includes <ORGANIZATION>University of North Texas</ORGANIZATION> linguist <PERSON>Timothy Montler</PERSON>, is
being financed for two years by a <MONEY>$161,000</MONEY> grant from the <ORGANIZATION>National
Endowment</ORGANIZATION> for the Humanities and the university.
   Montler, a computer expert, modified a program the team will use
to create the dictionary, which will define <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> words in
English and vice versa, <PERSON>Ms. Hardy</PERSON> said.
   Transcribing <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> to written form and translating it to
English hasn't been as tough as working with some other American
Indian languages, which use many sounds that don't exist in
English, <PERSON>Ms. Hardy</PERSON> said. Only one <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> sound _ a breathy,
slurred ``l'' _ is not found in English, she said. The dictionary
will represent it with an l crossed by a hyphen.
   But the language has its own special quirks.
   In other languages, for instance, plural forms usually add
something, be it an ``s'' in English or some prefix or suffix, <PERSON>Ms.
Hardy</PERSON> said. But in <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, to create a plural, the root word is
shortened. The <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> word ``batatli,'' for example, means to hit
one time, but the word ``batli'' means to hit repeatedly.
   ``We've never found anything like this,'' <PERSON>Ms. Hardy</PERSON> said. ``It
led to the joke that, in <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, less is more.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Hardy</PERSON> said she hopes the group's work will allow the tribe
to start a language reclamation program and create collections of
<LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> folk stories. ``<PERSON>Cora</PERSON> says the language is the culture,''
<PERSON>Ms. Hardy</PERSON> said. ``By preserving the language, you preserve a lot of
information about the culture.''

   Big, as I like to remind the tall people who have formed a
conspiracy to sit in front of me at the movies, is no
bargain. How much more practical and charming, for me and for
them, it would be if these giraffes made themselves available
publicly in miniature versions, like Reader's Digest
condensed books. But they persist in seeing their freakish
and obstructive size as a natural right to be flaunted
without apology. To its credit, however, the Oxford
University Press has taken the biggest jewel in its crown and
reproduced it in handy miniature form and at (relatively) low
price.
   "The Compact Oxford English Dictionary" (Prepared by J.A.
Simpson and E.S.C. Weiner, 2,416 pages, $295) is a small-type
edition of the full text of the full-size OED. That behemoth,
in the second edition published in 1989, now runs to 20 big
volumes, costs $2500 and weighs 138 pounds. By contrast, the
coltish COED contains the same 500,000-plus definitions,
127,000 pronunciations, 249,300 etymologies and 2.4 million
illustrative quotations garnered from the entire history of
our language -- all in one liftable 14-pound tome.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   How can this be? Basically they do it with lenses. The
COED, like its micrographic predecessor in two volumes, has
tiny type. But this new edition achieves the compact ideal by
compressing nine pages of the full OED onto a single
14-by-10-inch COED page.
   With the help of the Cyclopean domed magnifier that comes
with the book, it is fairly easy to read, if not browse
through. Its oceans of verbiage stretch from `a' (over six
pages) to `zyxt' (an obsolete Kentish form of the verb see).
   If you want a comprehensive historical dictionary, the OED
is obviously it. And this compact format is the only one for
people without wads of cash and four feet of shelf space to
devote to logomania. In other words, this is the <ORGANIZATION>OED</ORGANIZATION> for the
'90s.
   It should keep us happy until we move up to the CD-Rom
OED, which permits computer-like searches through the entire
mazy work, but the price (<MONEY>$950</MONEY>) and the lack of CD-Rom
hardware will keep most of us waiting a while for this
refinement. In the meantime, buyers of the COED will be able
to improve their dictionary skills by reading the full-size
text of the complimentary (and complementary) pamphlet by
<PERSON>Donna Lee Berg</PERSON>, "A User's Guide to the Oxford English
Dictionary."
   This 71-page primer is clearly intended to make the
dictionary itself user-friendly (a term amply defined, by the
way, in the OED itself). <PERSON>Ms. Berg</PERSON> brings off what might have
been a mundane task with verve. Her choice of example entries
to show how the <ORGANIZATION>OED</ORGANIZATION> musters quotations is clever if not
subtly provocative: academia, after, palumbine, periderm,
phlizz and wranlons.
   Everything on this jewel of a page has an ironic resonance
to it. <PERSON>Ms. Berg</PERSON> has chosen academia, I think, to surprise us
with how recently it popped into the language. The first
quotation is from <PERSON>William H. Whyte</PERSON>'s "The Organization Man"
of <DATE>1956</DATE>. The second instance, fruitily non-academic in
diction, is from the "White House Diary" of an author the <ORGANIZATION>OED</ORGANIZATION>
identifies with Wimbledonesque formality as <PERSON>Mrs. L.B.
Johnson</PERSON>: "If I had to capsule these two days in <LOCATION>Academia</LOCATION>, how
would I?"
   The citations for "after" show this common word's uncommon
possibilities, e.g. <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Julius Caesar</PERSON>: "If you know,
That I do fawne on men. . .And after scandall them." The
other four words are unusual and show the dictionary's range:
palumbine, superficially recondite, is actually a poetic and
mellifluous way of conjuring the wood pigeon or ring-dove;
periderm, on its face a Greek botanicism for "the corky
layers of plant-stems," turns out to have originated recently
among learned Germans; phlizz was <PERSON>Lewis Carroll</PERSON>'s "fanciful"
term for a fruit or flower without real substance, "hence,
allusively, anything without meaning or value, a mere name."
Yet phlizz, as <PERSON>Ms. Berg</PERSON> must want us to conclude, is no mere
word, but a splendid piece of whimsy worth knowing about and
reviving.
   She winds up her elegant demonstration with a
lexicographical flourish: the extremely obscure 15th-century
term wranlons, "unthriving trees that will never become
timber." In her own voice, <PERSON>Ms. Berg</PERSON> observes, in a quietly
deconstructionist vein, that such a word "may appear more
frequently in dictionaries than in other contexts."
   Not even the <ORGANIZATION>OED</ORGANIZATION> can contain every word. Owners of that
still more compact chrestomathy, "Chambers English
Dictionary," can be smug about myristicivorous
(nutmeg-eating), added to the <DATE>1988</DATE> Chambers after an earlier
edition specifically mentioned this jawbreaker as the kind of
obscurity impossible to include in a single-volume lexicon.
It is still not to be found in the OED.
   Perhaps it will be soon. <PERSON>Ms. Berg</PERSON>, in the course of
conceding that some entries in the current OED and COED lack
modern quotations, reveals that "updating these entries will
be one of the tasks of the third edition, ALREADY IN
PROGRESS" (joyful emphasis mine).
   ---
   Another compact source of useful information comes to us
now from the hand of <PERSON>Barbara Ensrud</PERSON>, who sometimes writes
about wine on this page. "Best Wine Buys for <MONEY>$10</MONEY> or Less, a
Guide for the <ORGANIZATION>Frugal Connoisseur Featuring Wines</ORGANIZATION> from Around
the World" (<ORGANIZATION>Villard</ORGANIZATION>, 170 pages, <MONEY>$9.95</MONEY>) is just what the title
so fully indicates.
   In a few well-chosen words, <PERSON>Ms. Ensrud</PERSON> leads us to the
outstanding values at the low end of the endlessly
proliferating wine market. She is eloquent and timely in her
discussion of the developing world of serious Chilean wines.
She is up to the minute on what to expect from the
surprisingly well-managed vineyards of <LOCATION>Bulgaria</LOCATION>. Arriving at
<LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>, she plumps for several "superbuys," most especially
the "dry, delightfully fruity" white muscat from <PERSON>Joao Pires</PERSON>.
She even finds superbuys in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>. I won't say
which, because that would be like revealing whodunit in a
murder mystery.

   The French are finally throwing in the
``serviette,'' or towel, in the global battle for linguistic
supremacy.
   French officials and teachers say English is unquestionably the
No. 1 international tongue and there's little point in going
``tete-a-tete'' with it any longer.
   The Germans agree. If a battle lies ahead, it may be between
French and German for second place.
   ``We can't make a linguistic Maginot Line,'' said <PERSON>Bernard
Cerquiglini</PERSON>, a leading French authority on language. ``That's what
we've been trying to do, especially against English. It's a lost
battle.''
   Cerquiglini, who is fluent in English, heads the <ORGANIZATION>General
Delegation</ORGANIZATION> of the French Language assigned by Prime Minister <PERSON>Michel
Rocard</PERSON> to promote the study of French abroad.
   He and his colleagues hope to make French the most popular
language throuhout <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, after English.
   ``Our strategy is to promote all European languages, to make
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> multilingual,'' <PERSON>Cerquiglini</PERSON> said. ``The riches of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> are
in its languages. If <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> becomes unilingual, the language will
be English. Obviously.''
   That view marks a strategic retreat in the long effort to
restore French to international leadership.
   In the 17th and 18th centuries, French was unchallenged as the
language of diplomacy and the conversation of educated people.
   The Industrial Revolution, led by <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, made English the
language of international commerce. By the time <PERSON>Queen Victoria</PERSON>'s
empire had spread English around the world, an Oxbridge accent had
as much cachet as aristocratic French.
   Diplomacy remained a francophone stronghold through the early
part of this century. The <ORGANIZATION>Versailles Treaty</ORGANIZATION>, after World War I, was
written in French and understood in that language by President
<PERSON>Woodrow Wilson</PERSON>.
   After World War II, the global role of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> built
an unrivaled position for English. <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s efforts to hold the
line have included aid to French-speaking countries, francophone
song festivals and even futile attempts to weed out ``franglais,''
English words used in common speech.
   Promoters of French see opportunity in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>. Nations
with historic links to <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> are the prime targets, paticularly
<LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Czechoslovakia</LOCATION>.
   Rocard's Cabinet said recently that promotion of French in
<LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION> should be ``a major component of foreign policy.''
   French television viewers were buoyed by seeing residents of
<LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION> speaking perfect French to reporters during the <DATE>December</DATE>
revolution in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>. French and Romanian are based on <LOCATION>Latin</LOCATION>, and
French is the only Western language many Romanians know.
   ``We've had great luck so far,'' said <PERSON>Catherine Michaud</PERSON> of the
<ORGANIZATION>Hachette Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, which sent 100,000 French-language books to
Romanian libraries. ``There are plenty of people who already know
French and want to keep learning it.''
   The world's best-known French school, the <ORGANIZATION>Alliance Francaise</ORGANIZATION>,
plans to add branches this year in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Bulgaria</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Czechoslovakia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION>. It already has schools in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>.
   French television is beamed to <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Czechoslovakia</LOCATION>, and
bilingual radio stations are starting up.
   ``I think that a cultivated man in the <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> of tomorrow will
need at least two languages besides his own,'' said <PERSON>Francois
Hingue</PERSON>, director of foreign services for <ORGANIZATION>Alliance Francaise</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``One will be English, the other probably French, or maybe
German. In <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> with the <ORGANIZATION>EEC</ORGANIZATION>, or <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> in banking, French is
definitely going to be an advantage.''
   A unified, economically strong <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> may seem in a better
position to establish its language in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Susanne Hoehn</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Goethe Institute</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Munich</LOCATION>, an organization
similar to the <ORGANIZATION>Alliance Francaise</ORGANIZATION>, said it is opening branches in
<LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Prague</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION>. She said the changes in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>
had produced ``an extremely strong increase in interest for
German.''
   According to the <ORGANIZATION>Goethe Institute</ORGANIZATION>'s figures, she said, 9.5
million people are studying German in the region and ``they need
textbooks, teachers, all kinds of teaching aides.''
   Germans in general seem less concerned with promoting their
language.
   It once was the lingua franca of science, but now ``there's a
tendency in medicine, in the sciences and engineering to publish
very much in English,'' said <PERSON>Werner Bies</PERSON>, an English specialist at
the <ORGANIZATION>Free University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>West Berlin</LOCATION>.
   He said ``the French try much harder'' to promote their own
language.
   The General Delegation of the French Language plans to sponsor
teacher exchanges with a unified <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> to encourage better French
instruction in the eastern sector.
   German school officials believe English will continue to be the
foreign language of choice, even among former East Germans who were
required to learn Russian.
   Cerquiglini believes the reason is partly psychological.
   ``For people who've been forced to learn Russian for a long
time, to learn Western languages like English and French is like
already having a bit of liberty,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A growing movement is afoot to rid <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>
of a pervasive vestige of the British colonial Raj: the English
language.
   It won't be easy.
   English is the language of law, government and some of the best
modern Indian literature.
   It is spoken by the wealthy and well-educated who have dominated
politics and business since independence in <DATE>1945</DATE>. They often are
called, derisively, the <PERSON>Brown Sahibs</PERSON>.
   Kapil Kapoort, a linguistics professor, predicted the movement
would grow because knowledge of English ``provides privileges to a
few, but it deprives privileges to many.''
   Experts estimate 35 million Indians know some English. That is
more than the population of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, double that of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and
about half the number of people in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, but only 4 percent
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s 880 million.
   Anti-English sentiment has arisen periodically, sometimes
accompanied by violence. This year, the campaign has gone farther
than before toward eliminating English from official business in
some of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s 25 states.
   <PERSON>Mulayam Singh Yadav</PERSON>, who leads the government of <PERSON>Uttar Pradesh</PERSON>,
the most populous state, banned the official use of English in
<DATE>April</DATE>. He instructed the courts to conduct their business
exclusively in <LOCATION>Hindi</LOCATION>, the language of about 200 mllion people in
northern <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>.
   Yadav also suggested forbidding English as the language of
instruction in private schools, where the children of many
well-to-do Indians are educated.
   Two other Hindi-speaking states in northern and central <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>
have ordered all official correspondence and public announcements
made in <LOCATION>Hindi</LOCATION>.
   In Goa, on the southwest coast, the local government tried to
cut off public funds for English-language schools and teachers
blocked the main highway for three days in protest.
   At a seminar in <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> <DATE>last month</DATE>, Yadav of Utter Pradesh
said: ``I will happily accept any Indian language as our national
language, but English must go.''
   There are plenty of indigenous tongues to choose from.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has 15 recognized official languages, including English. A
census in <DATE>1971</DATE> indicated 1,652 languages and dialects were spoken,
33 of them by more than a million people each.
   English billboards and signs rule the streets of <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>, in
the heart of the Hindi belt. One-fourth of all the newspapers
circulated in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> are in English, as are <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> of the books,
said publisher <PERSON>Ravi Dayal</PERSON>.
   ``It's not that easy to get rid of English,'' said <PERSON>M.P. Chhaya</PERSON>,
a consultant for the <ORGANIZATION>Education Department</ORGANIZATION>. ``It's only possible if
one common language besides English is accepted. That won't happen
soon.''
   One advantage of English is its neutrality. Although Hindi is by
far the most widely spoken language, southern Indians say adopting
it as the official national tongue would amount to accepting
northern domination.
   Chhaya said in an interview: ``English was thrust on us by the
British. They were the rulers and we had no choice. Now we are a
democracy. You can't thrust Hindi down everyone's throat.''
   Even politicians who rail most loudly against English send their
children to English-language schools, he said.
   In the English-language <ORGANIZATION>Indian Express</ORGANIZATION>, publisher <PERSON>Dayal</PERSON> wrote:
``Regional languages now dominate administrative activity in the
states. English has its own niche in the government at the Center
(federal level) and in communications with the states, in the
higher courts, in some universities.''
   Home Minister <PERSON>Mufti Mohammed Sayed</PERSON>, questioned in <LOCATION>Parliament</LOCATION>
about his sincerity in promoting Indian languages, admitted his
office had 633 typewriters in English and only 57 in the Devnagri
script used for <ORGANIZATION>Hindi</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The constitution was written in English,'' said <PERSON>Kapoor</PERSON>,
director of the <ORGANIZATION>Center for Linguistics</ORGANIZATION> and English at <ORGANIZATION>Jawaharlal
Nehru University</ORGANIZATION>. ``Maybe <PERCENT>98 percent</PERCENT> of the people can't read it,
but they are supposed to swear by it.''
   ``English is an instrument for making people feel inferior,'' he
said in an interview.
   Persian was the administrative language of the Mogul emperors
who united most of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> in the <DATE>16th century</DATE>, then English became
the tongue that linked the nation together.
   Sanskrit, ons and the medium of
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s classics, has been dead as a spoken idiom for 1,000 years.
   After 40 years of studying English, <PERSON>Kapoor</PERSON> said, he began to
appreciate his own culture when he discovered the importance of
Sanskrit and early Indian literature to Western thinkers.
   ``In this prestigious university, there is no department or
chair in <LOCATION>Sanskrit</LOCATION>,'' he said. ``We have chairs in all kinds of
classical languages, but not our own.''
   Resentment of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s ruling class feeds the anti-English
movement.
   ``They are a class of people deliberately created by the
British,'' <PERSON>Kapoor</PERSON> said. ``They are English in taste and opinion,
and Indian in blood and color.''

<P>
The importance of a strong vocabulary for children cannot be overstated. 
Students with the best vocabulary perform the best in college entrance exams 
and job interviews, and well-spoken people also have the upper hand in almost 
every imaginable social situation. 
</P>
<P>
Grade school is the best time to start helping your child develop language 
skills. There are many ways that you can do this while having fun and 
strengthening your bond with your grade-school child. 
</P>
<P>
The easiest and most important way to enlarge your child's vocabulary is by 
taking turns reading out loud, said <PERSON>Ilene Rotenberg</PERSON>, a teacher at <ORGANIZATION>Westminster 
Computer Magnet School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Venice</LOCATION>. "It sounds obvious," <PERSON>Rotenberg</PERSON> said, "but so 
many parents don't do it." 
</P>
<P>
Before reading together, pull out all of the words that you think your child 
may not know and go over them. This way the student will read smoothly and 
confidently without stumbling over unfamiliar words. 
</P>
<P>
To find out which words you can expect your child to know, ask his or her 
teacher for a copy of the Dolch List, which contains 220 words that are most 
vital for reading in primary grades. The list contains <PERCENT>76%</PERCENT> of the words used in 
first-grade books, <PERCENT>69%</PERCENT> of those in second-grade books and <PERCENT>62%</PERCENT> of the words in 
third-grade books. 
</P>
<P>
The list of 300 "Instant Words," edited by <PERSON>Edward Fry</PERSON>, is also useful because 
it has about <PERCENT>65%</PERCENT> of words read by children and adults. Amazingly, just the 
first 10 words on the list represent about a quarter of all printed English 
words. 
</P>
<P>
Make sure you have age-appropriate reading materials in the home. There are 
many magazines published just for children, but a favorite among <PERSON>Rotenberg</PERSON>'s 
fifth- and sixth-graders is "Stone Soup." 
</P>
<P>
"It's all written by children, all the articles, stories and poetry, and the 
art as well," she said. "Highlight" and "Cricket," which carry stories and word 
puzzles for elementary school children, are also popular. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best resources for expanding your child's vocabulary is the 
newspaper. It offers a variety of topics that children like, such as comics, 
horoscopes, sports play-by-plays and album charts. "You can make a game out of 
the newspaper," <PERSON>Rotenberg</PERSON> said. "I have my students read the want ads and I ask 
them to find me a new car or a job." 
</P>
<P>
To help your student decipher words, keep a children's dictionary handy. 
Bookstores usually carry a variety of colorful and widely differing 
"beginner's" dictionaries, so choose the one your child seems most interested 
in. 
</P>
<P>
Computer software is a powerful tool for vocabulary-building, and there are 
dozens of inexpensive educational packages. Many adventure programs are also 
good linguistic workouts because they make the child learn to follow 
directions, recognize word clues, and detect double or hidden meanings. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kristin Cady</PERSON>, a fifth-grader at <ORGANIZATION>Grant Elementary School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION>, has 
learned more than a hundred words from the "Reading Rabbit" software program, 
which features word games. "It's fun and it makes me more interested in reading 
and learning words," <PERSON>Kristin</PERSON> said. "If you do things right, the little rabbit 
dances and it's really funny." 
</P>
<P>
"If you want kids to learn words, it has to be a game," said <PERSON>Kristin</PERSON>'s father, 
<PERSON>Patrick Cady</PERSON>, a teacher at <ORGANIZATION>Santa Monica High</ORGANIZATION>. "Words have got to be seen as 
friends and tools, as well as academic." He suggested playing some simple word 
games with your child to make new words seem more friendly. 
</P>
<P>
Crossword puzzles are probably the most popular word game in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, and are 
very easy to find. Bookstores carry volumes and weekly magazines are full of 
them, and <ORGANIZATION>The Times</ORGANIZATION> provides one every day. Crosswords are great for learning 
synonyms and spelling. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, "Wheel of Fortune," minus <ORGANIZATION>Vanna</ORGANIZATION>'s evening gowns and <PERSON>Pat</PERSON>'s jokes, is 
actually a good exercise in vocabulary-building. Along with the contestants, 
your child can guess and spell the secret word or phrase. "Wheel" can help your 
kid practice spelling, separating vowels from consonants and classifying words. 
</P>
<P>
Educators and business leaders agree that vocabulary can affect your child's 
ability to get good grades, admission to college and the right job. Make sure 
your child develops a vocabulary that provides him or her with a competitive 
edge.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Management: George Orwell's 1994 - Simon Gibson explains why
the language that a company uses can have a direct effect on its financial
performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON GIBSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A company's fortunes are expressed by its figures, but its future is caught
in its language. While numbers are merely red or black, the words that a
company uses in its corporate speeches, articles and annual reports open up
a window on the way that management is thinking. Indeed, they show whether
it is thinking at all.
Companies today are required to communicate more regularly than ever before,
both to internal and external audiences. Many cope admirably, many others
fail. All too often executives resort to management-speak rather than using
clear and original expression.
The struggle against the corruption of the language goes beyond the concern
of the corporate communications director - it is a business issue. Indeed,
one can argue that the language that a company uses can have a direct effect
on its financial performance.
The enemies of clear expression are not unique to the world of business.
They are language's common foe, given new clothing. In one of the great
essays on this subject, Politics and the English Language, <PERSON>George Orwell</PERSON>
listed a number of 'bad habits which spread by imitation', which he believed
were signs of the corruption of political thought at that time.
These bad habits included: pretentious diction, meaningless words, dead
metaphors, hackneyed phrases, cliche and jargon. It is a list that one could
level at today's business communications with equal legitimacy.
Perhaps the most obvious villain is jargon. The language of business is full
of it: empowerment, downsizing, proactive, business re-engineering,
networking. These are just a few of the jargon words that are trotted out at
innumerable business meetings.
The argument is not specifically against industry coining technical words to
describe its processes, but rather against the misuse of such technical
terms. Indeed, certain industries have built up their own vocabulary of
technical words that when used are quite precise.
Frequently, the problem occurs when words are borrowed from other activities
in an effort to mystify the business of business. For example, 'downsizing
the headcount' sounds more cerebral, worthy and expensive than 'giving
people the sack'. Equally, it seems that everyone who has been given the
sack recently has not been made redundant, but has become a consultant.
Consultants are often the worst offenders when it comes to the use of
jargon, presumably in the vain attempt to remain part of the corporate club.
Some will see these accusations of the corruption of language as a crusade
against Americanisation. It is not. Silicon Valley may be responsible for
some of the worst excesses of techno-babble, but these are only injurious
when misused. Again 'downsizing' is a good example. When applied to
computers it is a forgiveably neat way to describe the migration from
mainframe to client-server technology; applied to people it is simply
dehumanising.
Nor is the argument an elitist one, part of an effort to protect the purity
of our culture in the way that the French establishment is currently
attempting.
The argument is simply against the use of language without meaning or with
false meaning. Too often meaningless words or phrases are used simply to
indicate that the speaker belongs to the middle management club. 'Vision',
'challenge', 'short-termism', 'whither', 'I hear where you're coming from',
'we need to manage change', 'think global, act local' are all typical
examples. Describing business partnerships as 'getting into bed with'
someone was another common example of this trait; often heard in the <DATE>1980s</DATE>
it has fortunately gone out of fashion.
Another feature of this language of acceptance is what one might term the
proposition of the indisputable. For instance, phrases such as 'people are
our most important asset', 'I'm with <ORGANIZATION>Cadbury</ORGANIZATION> on that one' or 'we are
committed to giving our shareholders a sound return on their investment',
are all so palpably blessed with holy oil that no one would dare argue
against them. Anyone caught using them is probably begging as many questions
as they are attempting to answer.
When was the last time you can remember someone daring to question a speaker
who extolled the values of 'total quality management' or of being
'market-driven'? Yet phrases such as these are frequently misused and most
often employed by people who have not thought sufficiently about quality or
the marketplace. They are merely camouflage.
Without them, without cliche, jargon and other dead language, most
businesses would work better. So what should govern the way that companies
and those in business express themselves?
Prescriptive lists are always dangerous. Language is far too individual to
be shackled by too many rules. However, there are good guidelines. <PERSON>Orwell</PERSON>
suggested the following:
Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are used to
seeing in print.
Never use a long word when a short one will do.
If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
Never use the passive where you can use the active.
Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you can
think of an everyday English equivalent.
Break any of these rules rather than say anything that is outright
barbarous.
These guidelines are still sound. If a company were to banish the bad habits
and take up <PERSON>Orwell</PERSON>'s principles, managers would have less camouflage to hide
behind. Employees would be more likely to think for themselves.
In the process some startling things might be discovered: for example, that
people may not be the most important asset of the company or that
shareholder value may not be the only golden rule for senior management.
Above all, clear language both encourages and reflects clarity of thought
and, in business, isn't that the only real asset a company can depend upon?

It's a light bat for tennis with a network of catgut, silk, or nylon in an oval 
frame attached to a handle, according to <PERSON>Webster</PERSON>'s New World Dictionary of the 
<ORGANIZATION>American Language</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
But how do you spell it? R-a-c-k-e-t or r-a-c-q-u-e-t? 
</P>
<P>
The two orthographies have been volleyed back and forth since the sport was 
invented and there have been many variations to this day. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Webster</PERSON>'s defines the word only under the 'k' spelling, but the dictionary also 
says "same as racket" under the racquet listing. 
</P>
<P>
Although no one is getting involved in head-to-head competition over the 
matter, some tennis enthusiasts have a preference. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just always known r-a-c-q-u-e-t is how you spell it," <PERSON>Alexander McNab</PERSON>, 
Editor of "Tennis" magazine, said emphatically. 
</P>
<P>
McNab, 37, has been playing tennis since he was 10 years old and said he has 
always spelled the word that way. 
</P>
<P>
And so has his magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The cover of Tennis magazine's premiere issue, published <DATE>May, 1965</DATE>, read, 
"Tennis -- The Magazine of the Racquet Sports." 
</P>
<P>
But even in <DATE>1965</DATE>, when the instrument was still generally composed of wood and 
<PERSON>Roy Emerson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Margaret Smith</PERSON> won <LOCATION>Wimbledon</LOCATION>, the reader had to look no further 
than the third page of that issue to see the other spelling. 
</P>
<P>
A <LOCATION>Bancroft</LOCATION> advertisement urged tennis buffs to "Play with <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s New No. 1 
Tennis Racket." 
</P>
<P>
The editors at Tennis have no control over how their advertisers spell the 
word. 
</P>
<P>
McNab said the magazine follows The <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION>' style. The company has 
owned the magazine since the early <DATE>1970s</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The piece of equipment itself has undergone many structural and cosmetic 
changes over the <DATE>last 20 years</DATE>, first with the move from a wood to aluminum 
body and later to fiberglass and graphite constructions. 
</P>
<P>
While those innovations have affected the dynamics of the game, the impact of 
the often-used 'qu' version is more subtle, but it exists, according to <PERSON>John 
Singler</PERSON>, an assistant professor of linguistics at <ORGANIZATION>New York University</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at who the tennis pros are, considering their backgrounds and all, 
you see this spelling is just reinforcing the snob appeal," <PERSON>Singler</PERSON> said, 
referring to the 'qu' version. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you bring in something that's French it's brought in for snob 
appeal." 
</P>
<P>
The French spelling is racquette. 
</P>
<P>
Singler explains that language doesn't decide that one spelling of a word is 
more prestigious than another; the writers and speakers of the language make 
that distinction. 
</P>
<P>
The notion that there is only one way to spell a word is relatively recent, 
according to <PERSON>Singler</PERSON>, arriving with the <ORGANIZATION>18th Century</ORGANIZATION> ascendancy of the 
grammarians in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Singler</PERSON> has his own preference. "A racket's a racket and it's a ck," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Oxford English dictionary lists the following among its historic spellings 
and usages for the word: 
</P>
<P>
 -- <DATE>1624</DATE> - Captain <PERSON>John Smith</PERSON>, writing about <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>: "The beaver, his tail 
somewhat like the form of a racket..." 
</P>
<P>
 -- <DATE>1828</DATE> - <PERSON>Benjamin Disraeli</PERSON>, former British prime minister: "In the tennis 
court he toiled with the racquet." 
</P>
<P>
 -- <DATE>1897</DATE> - Outing, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> magazine: "When the racquette is fastened the heel 
and toe are free." 
</P>
<P>
The spelling difference has nothing to do with "snob appeal," <PERSON>McNab</PERSON> said, but 
rather "it's a matter of being correct versus being incorrect. I think we're 
right and other people are wrong." 
</P>
<P>
The linguist <PERSON>Singler</PERSON> supports his "snob appeal" explanation with an example. 
</P>
<P>
The spelling of the word for a loud disturbance or the slang word for an easy, 
profitable business or profession would never become r-a-c-q-u-e-t because 
those usages don't have any elitist associations, <PERSON>Singler</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The advertising world, though, has not overlooked even that possibility. 
</P>
<P>
A magazine ad for <ORGANIZATION>Clairol</ORGANIZATION>, featuring a woman with long flowing hair holding the 
object in question against her face as if it were a veil, reads, "Beautiful 
hair is our racquet." 
</P>
<P>
The spelling in <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> style and word usage manual is 
r-a-c-k-e-t. 
</P>
<P>
But who cares anyway? asks <PERSON>W. Timothy Gallwey</PERSON>, author of "The Inner Game of 
Tennis," a <DATE>1974</DATE> tennis instruction book that uses the 'k' form. 
</P>
<P>
Gallwey said he has never thought about the issue and said he thinks he 
probably spells it both ways. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a decadent society that considers such issues," he said.

<LEADPARA>  ENGLISH playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan died July 7, 1816, but one of the
characters he created remains very much alive in our language today.;    In
Sheridan's first comedy, a play called "The Rivals," he coined the name for
one of his characters by combining the French words "malapropos" ("not
appropriate"). The result was one Mrs. Malaprop, who took such pride in her
use of big words, but who always seemed to confuse one for another. She
described her niece as being "as headstrong as an 'allegory' on the banks of
the Nile," and she urged her to "illiterate" a certain gentleman from her
memory.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Ever since, the often-humorous and unintentional misuse of one word for
another has been called a "malapropism" or just a "malaprop." Malaprops abound
in the written and spoken English of children and adults alike. Most are just
simple cases of choosing the wrong word from the many pairs of English words
that are similar and often confused, such as oral/aural, flaunt/flout.;    But
occasionally, the literal meaning of the malaprop can produce a very comical
visual image, as when the politician said he "didn't want to cast asparagus"
at his opponent, or when the science student wrote "The Abominable Cavity
contains the Bowels, of which there are five: A, E, I, O, and U.";   
MALAPROPS, then, offer parents and teachers a way to combine learning and fun
in children's language education. When children picture both what is actually
being said and what the speaker or writer intended to say, the silly scenes
not only stretch their imagination but also teach vocabulary and reinforce the
importance of precise spelling.;    You can get help in creating a list of
comical malaprops from such library books as "A Children's Almanac Of Words At
Play," by <PERSON>Willard Espy</PERSON>, and from the routines of comedians who have built
their careers on this type of word play (Norm Crosby comes quickly to mind).
Have your children picture and describe what each sentence actually says, and
then what the writer intended to say. Make sure you reveal (or have your child
spell or write) the intended word after each sentence.;    Even young children
get a special pleasure from the silly scenes resulting when words are misused
or misinterpreted. The fact that so many common English words are identical in
sound, and sometimes in spelling, to words with vastly different meanings
creates an abundance of opportunities for experiencing the many benefits of
word play at an early age.;     <PERSON>FRED Gwynne</PERSON> (of television's "The Munsters"
fame) has written and illustrated several books (such as "The King Who
Rained") that picture for children the crazy ways some words and phrases can
be misinterpreted. <PERSON>Peggy Parish</PERSON> has also written a series of comical books
about "<PERSON>Amelia Bedelia</PERSON>," a maid who follows all directions literally and so,
for example, takes out a sketch pad to "draw" the drapes.;    It is only a
very short literary distance from unintentional malaprops to intentional puns.
Instead of discouraging children from repeating and creating knock-knock jokes
and "How's business?" jokes (for example, "I'm in the firecracker business."
"How's business?" "Booming!"), parents should keep in mind that this type of
word play allows children to see early on that their own language offers a
constant source of material to twist and contort for amusement. Soon, the puns
will grow into "<PERSON>Tom Swifties</PERSON>" ("I can't find the oranges," <PERSON>Tom</PERSON> said
fruitlessly.) and "daffy definitions" ("Boomerang: What you say when you
frighten a meringue"). Just look what that did for "Carnac the Magnificent."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>French Government Losing Battle Against Franglais</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   One recent morning, a newscast on <ORGANIZATION>France Inter</ORGANIZATION> radio
carried a story about ``le dumping'' by the Japanese on European
markets. The newspaper Liberation had a headline saying a top
politician was in ``les starting blocks'' for coming elections. In
the afternoon, ``un outsider'' won the day's top horse race.
   For years the French government has been battling the creeping
invasion of English without much success. Every time a new French
word is invented, such as ``logiciel'' for computer software, or
``cadreur'' for cameraman, six new Englishisms pop into the language.
   ``Couch potato'' has yet to gain currency in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, but it can't
be far away. An article in Le Monde about American television
introduced the term, calling such a person ``une patate de canape.''
   Most French profess to hate Franglais. On the other hand, most
use it. From morning to night, in newspapers, on radio and in
conversations, one is bombarded with ``le marketing,'' ``un
challenge,'' ``le sponsor,'' ``un leader,'' or ``un self-made-man.''
   Successive governments have made fighting Franglais their
official policy, creating a series of organizations to counter it.
   The most recent is the <ORGANIZATION>Commissariat General de la Langue
Francaise</ORGANIZATION>, which emerged in <DATE>1984</DATE> with the job of ``the defense of
the French language.'' The agency has just published the fifth
edition of its dictionary of official neologisms.
   The 2,393 neologisms _ new French words _ in the book are
mandatory for use in all ministries, official correspondence and
documents. But getting the public to accept them is another matter.
The folks at the <ORGANIZATION>Commissariat</ORGANIZATION> have no enforcement power; usage, not
policy, determines the success or failure of a word.
   ``It is out of the question that we play the role of policing the
language,'' said <PERSON>Bernard Billaud</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Commissariat</ORGANIZATION>'s chief
wordmaster. ``Our role is to raise consciousness.''
   Many feel that the adoption of foreign words enriches a language,
within limits.
   ``All languages borrow words,'' <PERSON>Billaud</PERSON> said. ``It goes in the
other direction too. It is not so much a problem of borrowing words
as it is a matter of `naturalization' of the word borrowed and the
spirit of the word'' to make it really French.
   Fewer than 2,500 official neologisms is not a particularly
distinguished showing for nearly 20 years of work by the
<ORGANIZATION>Commissariat</ORGANIZATION> and its predecessors. But word-making is a long process.
   ``We have to consult specialists, find a word, perhaps consult
with the Academie Francaise,'' says <PERSON>Billaud</PERSON>, referring that oldest
of the guardians of the language (it was created by Richelieu in
<DATE>1635</DATE>). Billaud also acknowledges that there are ``serious gaps'' in
the dictionary.
   English-speakers are constantly amused by the struggle.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Commissariat</ORGANIZATION> has decreed that ``un bulldozer''
(bool-doe-zair) will now be a ``bouteur;'' journalists no longer get
``un scoop,'' but an ``exclusivite;'' pilots no longer work in ``un
cockpit,'' but in a ``habitacle.''
   Officialdom also has zapped ``zapping,'' the term used here for
TV-channel jumping. It has replaced it with ``saute-chaine,'' which
literally means ``channel-jump.''
   It has substituted ``tuiteur'' and ``boumeur'' for tweeters and
woofers on stereo sets. But try as it might, it has never been able
to get people to use ``Agetac'' _ the French version of the acronym
<ORGANIZATION>GATT</ORGANIZATION> (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), and ``bande video
promotionelle'' just doesn't beat ``un clip.'' ``Un clip'' refers to
any promotional video, especially music videos.
   The word factory also has failed to come up with satisfactory
replacements for ``le look,'' when referring to image; ``le stress''
for day-to-day pressure, ``le sandwich'' or ``un blue-jean.''
   Perhaps more unusual are English words that, when absorbed into
French, lose their original meaning, such as ``le forcing,'' which
is to apply pressure, or ``un gadget,'' which can even be applied to
a government minister or program, meaning something just for show.
   The real irony is when English speakers steal a French term, like
``savoir faire,'' and the French retaliate by swiping ``know-how.''
The same can be said of ``rendezvous'' and ``meeting.''
   Worst of all are the sweatshirts and imitation American high
school jackets, where the fashion is to have English words written
on them, no matter how nonsensical, such as ``Athletic Sporting
Team,'' or ``Babie Bear Club.'' Then there's the sweatshirt that
says ``Scoop Entrainement <DATE>Winter</DATE>,'' which has no meaning at all and
is a spoof on the proliferation of English words on sweatshirts.
(``Entrainement'' is French for training.)
   Why this fascination with English?
   ``Much of the usage of English is snobbism,'' said <PERSON>Billaud</PERSON>,
speaking in French but slipping into an Englishism _ ``snobbisme,''
which has made its way into the French dictionary.
   ``It takes a psychoanalysis of the French people, who have always
been impressed by what comes from the outside,'' he added. ``It is
evidently a phenomenon resulting from the decline of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in the
world since <DATE>1939</DATE>. <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> is conscious its influence has diminished.
It is trying to find compensation. English plays this role.
   ``The French want to be modern, and English is a sign of
modernity.''

<HEAD>Dictionary Seeks Compromise on `Jew'; Jews Not Satisfied</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: The following contains references to racial epithets, especially
16th graf, which some readers may find offensive.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Concise Oxford Dictionary</ORGANIZATION> has offered a
compromise in its long-running quarrel with Jewish groups over its
inclusion of the word ``Jew'' as a racial slur.
   The Jewish campaigners say they welcome the change but believe
it's not enough.
   The disputed entry defines ``Jew'' as ``1. person of Hebrew
descent; person whose religion is Judaism... 2. (derog., colloq.; R)
person who drives hard bargains, usurer. ...''
   And as a verb: ``(derog., colloq.; R) cheat, bargain with
(person) to lower his price.''
   ``Derog., colloq.; R'' stands for ``derogatory, colloquial,
racially offensive.''
   According to a letter from <PERSON>S.J. Tulloch</PERSON>, senior assistant editor
of the dictionary, to the <ORGANIZATION>Council of Christians</ORGANIZATION> and Jews, the next
edition will add: ``The stereotype, which is now deeply offensive,
arose from historical associations of Jews as money-lenders in
medieval <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>.''
   The aim, <PERSON>Mrs. Tulloch</PERSON> wrote, is to put things into context.
   But council director <PERSON>Canon Jim Richardson</PERSON> said he wished the
dictionary simply would drop all the pejorative definitions.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Tulloch</PERSON> wrote that dictionaries had to record, not to pass
judgment, and that ``Jew'' pejoratively ``is still current both as a
noun and as a verb.''
   <PERSON>Richardson</PERSON>, an Anglican clergyman whose organization fosters
Christian-Jewish understanding, disagreed. ``She said it was in
common practice. We actually doubt that and ask: Is it really in
use? Couldn't it be left out?''
   ``The Jewish community is very sensitive about the definition of
`Jew' in the <ORGANIZATION>Oxford Dictionary</ORGANIZATION>,'' he said in an interview. ``The
definition of `Jew' as a usurer, as a person who strikes a hard
bargain, promotes an anti-Jewish attitude.''
   He said the lexicographers' latest step was ``very much a move in
the right direction, but we won't be satisfied until it (the
definition) is scrapped, because it is dangerous.''
   <PERSON>Mrs. Tulloch</PERSON> wrote: ``The meaning of Jew that you mention is
certainly offensive, but that is not grounds for omitting it from
the dictionary, nor does our inclusion of it imply that we condone
its use in this sense. Instead, it should be carefully labeled, so
that the reader understands the context in which it exists.''
   <PERSON>Shimon Cohen</PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON>Lord Jakobovitz</PERSON>, the chief rabbi of
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, said he was ``somewhat pleased'' with the proposed change,
but also wanted the pejorative definitions removed altogether.
   Other British dictionaries also include pejorative definitions of
``Jew.'' Chambers <ORGANIZATION>20th Century Dictionary</ORGANIZATION>, published in <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>,
defines the word as ``usurer, miser.'' The Longman Dictionary of the
English Language attributes its origin to ``the alleged sharpness of
Jews in business dealings.''
   Chambers, <PERSON>Longman</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Oxford</ORGANIZATION> also list the meanings of ``kike,''
``sheeny,'' ``wog,'' ``nigger'' and ``chink'' with notations that
they are offensive slang.
   In the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Webster</PERSON>'s New World Dictionary has restored
obscene words and racial slurs after prolonged banishment.
   <PERSON>David B. Guralnik</PERSON>, editor-in-chief until his recent retirement,
expunged the words in the <DATE>1970s</DATE> in a practice mocked by some British
lexicographers as ``Guralnikism,'' but restored them in the latest
edition published in <DATE>September</DATE>.
   The verb to ``jew'' is defined in <PERSON>Webster</PERSON>'s as ``to swindle;
cheat; gyp'' with the warning: ``This is a vulgar and offensive
usage even when not consciously expressing an anti-Semitic
attitude.''
   ``Times have changed,'' said the present editor in chief,
<PERSON>Victoria Neufeldt</PERSON>. ``There is far more acceptance in print of all
the vulgar terms and what <PERSON>David Guralnik</PERSON> called the true obscenities
_ ethnic slurs.''
   In a telephone interview from her <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> office, she said she
did not think dictionary inclusion of such words encouraged their
usage.
   ``Putting `ain't' in the dictionary hasn't made `ain't' more
acceptable. Dictionaries don't have that power,'' she said.
   In <DATE>1973</DATE>, <PERSON>Marcus Shloimovitz</PERSON>, an English Jewish textile merchant,
took the <ORGANIZATION>Oxford Dictionary</ORGANIZATION> to court to force it to stop defining a
Jew as ``a grasping or extortionate money-lender or usurer.''
   He argued that ``the Jewish race includes sages, scholars,
judges, scientists and people from the arts and stage. They have
done great service for their countries. They are not cheats or
unscrupulous usurers.''
   Shloimovitz lost because he failed to prove the dictionary
entries caused him personal suffering. But the lexicographers
subsequently toned down the disputed definitions.

(``Entrainement'' is French for training.)
   Why this fascination with English?
   ``Much of the usage of English is snobbism,'' said <PERSON>Billaud</PERSON>,
speaking in French but slipping into an Englishism _ ``snobbisme,''
which has made its way into the French dictionary.
   ``It takes a psychoanalysis of the French people, who have always
been impressed by what comes from the outside,'' he added. ``It is
evidently a phenomenon resulting from the decline of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in the
world since <DATE>1939</DATE>. <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> is conscious its influence has diminished.
It is trying to find compensation. English plays this role.
   ``The French want to be modern, and English is a sign of
modernity.''

<TEXT>     Although her spoken English is limited, her intelligence and energy are
not. In a detailed poster, Cristalina analyzed the political and economic
causes of the <ORGANIZATION>Colonial Revolution</ORGANIZATION> to the point of poetic metaphor for a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
history class assignment.;   For a student with only limited English to have
the analytical skills to liken the British Empire to a sick, then dying man
losing his grip on his surroundings, and to do it in English, does not
surprise guidance counselor <PERSON>Karen Ramirez.</PERSON>;   "We get a good number, of
students who come with skills and motivation, but no English language skills,"
<PERSON>Ramirez</PERSON> said. "Because they can't read English doesn't mean they can't
think.";   <ORGANIZATION>Sequoia</ORGANIZATION>'s English proficiency program, chaired by <PERSON>Joan Green</PERSON>, has
been struggling with the question of how to motivate and interest these kids
while teaching them basic language skills since <DATE>1978</DATE>. They think they've
arrived at a solution with their sheltered studies program.;   "The one huge
dilemma schools have to agonize over is: Do you immerse them at the expense of
learning or do you give them a so-called "sheltered" bilingual program where
you give them studies and hope they learn the language?" Green said.;   Just
learning a language isn't very challenging, <ORGANIZATION>Green</ORGANIZATION> said. And kids who aren't
challenged are kids who get bored and lose interest in school. "We want to
keep them on track with their peers and we want to keep them in school," Green
said.;   At <ORGANIZATION>Sequoia</ORGANIZATION>, kids learn English by studying social studies, science
and mathematics. The materials -- books, lectures, slides and classroom
assignments -- are in English.;   But discussions and reinforcement are in
Spanish as often as they are in English.;   "The hardest part about learning a
language is expressing yourself in it," Green said. "Here they may comprehend
the material and they can feel competent and successful and they can move
ahead.";   Most of the students in the program are Latino, <ORGANIZATION>Green</ORGANIZATION> said. But
they reach many Vietnamese, as well as the occasional Russian, Bulgarian and
Chinese student.;   "It's tougher for the kids who don't speak either Spanish
or English," she said. "For them, it nearly is an immersion program.";   But
funny things happen. "Last year, we had Vietnamese students who learned
Spanish as well as English -- and the other kids learned a few words of
Vietnamese," Green said.;   Current research shows it takes four to seven
years to learn a language well enough to be able to talk about tough concepts
in it, Green said.;   "The intent is to maximize their learning potential and
keep them on track with their peers and still provide a lot of English
language instruction -- and provide bilingual support and expression," she
said.;   So Sequoia's program teaches the kids world geography in the ninth
grade, world culture in the 10th, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> history in the 11th and government and
economics in the 12th.;   Those classes are taught over a double class period
by one teacher, who works on language as much as content. The kids chart
history, act out events and set up economic systems to enhance their
comprehension of the English language texts and discussions.;   "Once you've
felt the tax collector come and take your money when you have nothing to say
about it, you understand the idea of taxation without representation," Green
said.;   "It does not mean simplifying content or important concepts," she
said. "It means taking those important concepts out of the language they're
embedded in.";   The students also study math, science and, of course,
grammar. In those classes, they usually have bilingual teachers or teachers'
aides, <ORGANIZATION>Green</ORGANIZATION> said.;   "These kids want to go to college so we have to teach
them on a high enough level that they can aim for it," Green said.  </TEXT>

   Jesus rides into <LOCATION>Jerusalem</LOCATION> on a donkey instead of
an ass in a new English-language Bible that is careful not to upset
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> readers, the editor said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   ``The old usage is a classic example of offense being caused in
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> for obvious reasons,'' said <PERSON>Roger Coleman</PERSON>,
coordinating editor of ``The Revised English Bible.''
   In <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, the word ass doesn't have as many meanings as it does
in American use.
   ``References to ass have been adjusted to the inoffensive and
unambiguous donkey,'' he said.
   The change is one of thousands in the 1,294-page revision of
``The New English Bible,'' which appeared in <DATE>1970</DATE> and which in
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> has largely replaced the Authorized Version or King <PERSON>James
Bible</PERSON> of <DATE>1611</DATE> and its <DATE>late 19th</DATE>- century Revised Version.
   <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> said American viewpoints reached the translators through
the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> offices of the <ORGANIZATION>Oxford</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION> university presses,
which are jointly printing the new Bible.
   ``They came largely from people who want to use the <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION>
literally, with only the meanings they attribute to the words,
although a large number of Americans are used to the Authorized
Version where `ass' is used liberally,'' <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> said.
   The publishers describe the new Bible as a linguistically updated
version, whose style relates less to the vocabulary of a
<DATE>19th-century</DATE> clergyman and more to the needs of a 20th-century
congregation.
   It substitutes ``you'' for ``thee'' and ``thou,'' ``did'' for
``didst'' and abandons the ``O'' in references to God such as ``O
Lord.''
   God is still referred to as ``he'' (but without a capital H) in
faithfulness to the original writings, <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> said, but in other
references to gender the version grapples with sexism for the first
time in a British-produced Bible.
   ``English is not too well equipped to express gender,'' <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON>
told a news conference.
   ``We carefully looked at all cases where male-oriented language
was used _ `men' or `brethren' applied to people of both sexes _ and
we used an inclusive gender term or adjusted the translation to
sidestep the problem,'' he said.
   ``Brethren'' becomes ``friends'' in some places and ``a man''
sometimes is changed to ``a person.''
   Elsewhere, ``corn'' has been changed to ``grain'' in many cases
because it means wheat in some countries, maize in others and oats
in <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>William Duff McHardy</PERSON>, formerly Regius Professor of Hebrew at
<ORGANIZATION>Oxford University</ORGANIZATION>, the revision's director, was asked why the
phrase, ``Vanity of vanities ... all is vanity'' from the first
chapter of <LOCATION>Ecclesiastes</LOCATION> was changed to ``Futility, utter futility.''
   ``We discussed it for a long time,'' he said. ``Vanity did not
represent all that the original Hebrew ought to represent, but
futility was the best we could do. We still have slight misgivings.''
   <PERSON>Morna Hooker</PERSON>, professor of New Testament studies at <ORGANIZATION>Cambridge
University</ORGANIZATION> and the only woman among the revisers, said: ``If God was
referred to as `she,' it wouldn't be the <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION>, which one must
remember is 19 centuries old. You must always stand at a slight
distance from it.''
   Scholars of all <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s mainstream churches cooperated for the
first time in the revision, which took 15 years: Anglicans, Roman
Catholics, Presbyterians, Methodists, <LOCATION>Baptists</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Quakers</ORGANIZATION>, the
<ORGANIZATION>Salvation Army</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION> societies.
   Literary advisers included the poet <PERSON>Philip Larkin</PERSON> before his
death in <DATE>1985</DATE> and novelist <PERSON>Mary Stewart</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Lord Coggan</PERSON>, former archbishop of <ORGANIZATION>Canterbury</ORGANIZATION> and a scholar of
ancient Hebrew who presided over meetings of the project committee,
said they aimed to produce the ``first fully ecumenical Bible'' in
``straightforward language for reading in church that can be
immediately understood.''
   ``The Bible is one of the main tools of the Christian church but
tools get blunt and the edges need resharpening. Knowledge increases
as the years go by, language changes and style alters,'' he said.
   The new Bible, officially published <DATE>Sept. 28</DATE> but already on sale,
will be used immediately in Protestant churches but still needs the
imprimatur _ license to publish _ of Catholic authorities before
their congregations can use it, <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> said.
   The revisers met in the <ORGANIZATION>Jerusalem Chamber of 900-year-old
Westminster Abbey</ORGANIZATION> where the compilers of the first Revised Version
met from <DATE>1871</DATE> to <DATE>1881</DATE>.
   The work is being printed in a first run of 300,000 copies for
the English-speaking world, including 200,000 for the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>,
said <PERSON>Geoffrey Cass</PERSON>, chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Cambridge University Press</ORGANIZATION>.

JACK SMITH: OURS HAS BECOME THE LANGUAGE OF THE NATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We all know that English is a crazy language, a truth popularized by <PERSON>Richard 
Lederer</PERSON> in his recent book, "Crazy English" (Pocket Books). 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Allan Paul</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Costa Mesa</ORGANIZATION> sends an excerpt from <ORGANIZATION>Writer</ORGANIZATION>'s Digest in which <PERSON>Lederer</PERSON> 
notes that English is the most widely spoken language in the history of our 
planet, has the largest vocabulary of all the world's languages (perhaps as 
many as 2 million words), and is, in a word, crazy. 
</P>
<P>
Among many anomalies, he points out that we have words to express certain 
things or ideas only when they don't exist. "Have you ever seen a horseful 
carriage, or a strapful gown? Have you ever rubbed into someone who was 
combobulated, sheveled, gruntled, plussed, chalant, ruly, gainly, maculate, 
pecunious or peccable?" 
</P>
<P>
"But still," he concedes, "you have to marvel at the unique lunacy of the 
English language." 
</P>
<P>
How difficult English is for foreigners is illustrated in "English Well 
Speeched Here" (Price Stern Sloan), a booklet called to my attention by <PERSON>Jane 
Wyatt</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Compiled by <PERSON>Nini Lo Bello</PERSON>, it gives examples of signs, in English, seen around 
the world. For example, a sign in a Norwegian cocktail lounge: "Women are 
requested not to have children in the bar." A sign outside a clothing store in 
<LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>: "Come inside and have a fit." In a <LOCATION>Florence</LOCATION> shop window: "Dresses for 
Street Walking." A <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> laundry suggests: "Ladies, leave your clothes here and 
spend the afternoon having a good time." A <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION> hotel advises: "Because of 
the impropriety of entertaining guests of the opposite sex in the bedroom, it 
is suggested that the lobby be used for this purpose." Equally moralistic is a 
sign in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s Black Forest: "It is strictly forbidden on our <ORGANIZATION>Black Forest</ORGANIZATION> 
camping site that people of different sex, for instance, men and women, live 
together in one tent unless they are married with each other for that purpose." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, adman <PERSON>Stephen Baker</PERSON>, whose native language is Hungarian, 
extols English as the language of the angels in a Writer's Digest article sent 
me by <PERSON>Meredith Brucker</PERSON>. "No other language is like it," he says. "Nothing even 
comes close to it in sound, eloquence, and just plain common sense." 
</P>
<P>
Illustrating the versatility of English, he notes that in Hungarian jumpers 
could only ugri (jump). In <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, they can leap, hop, vault, <DATE>spring</DATE>, bound, 
bounce, caper, prance, buck, trip, bob, skip or even go hippity-hop. 
</P>
<P>
I won't say all those words are exact synonyms for jump, but you get the idea. 
He points out that we have no academy to enforce standard English on us. We are 
free to invent and enlarge and change. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, in this country the line between 'correct' and 'colloquial' speech 
has become so blurred as to be nearly imperceptible to all but the most 
consummate wordsmiths." (Well, everyone to their own opinion about that.) 
</P>
<P>
I especially agree with <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> that "the free and uninhibited use of the pronoun 
you in English pretty much stands alone among speakers of the world. Americans 
should feel fortunate to be so blessed." 
</P>
<P>
He notes that the French, Dutch, Scandinavians and Russians have at least two 
second person pronouns, one familiar, one unfamiliar. Germans have three, 
Italians have four, the Spanish five and the Portuguese 20. 
</P>
<P>
I am well aware of how important this distinction is, at least in French. Once 
I referred to my French daughter-in-law's younger sister as tu, instead of 
vous. She seemed embarrassed; my wife and my daughter-in-law were shocked. I 
didn't know what I had done wrong. My wife explained to me that one uses the 
pronoun tu only for persons with whom one is very familiar. 
</P>
<P>
"Vivid in my memory," <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> recalls, "is the resounding slap meted out by my 
high-spirited Hungarian girlfriend who felt that my switching to the familiar 
te after a single perfunctory kiss at the door was just a bit premature." 
</P>
<P>
As for our you, he says, "Those born and raised here rarely appreciate the 
impact of this unassuming but handy little word. Quite possibly you represents 
one of the cornerstones of democracy. Because of it, cabdriver or passenger, 
celebrity or ordinary citizen, worker or manager all converse on the same level 
playing field." 
</P>
<P>
Baker urges his fellow immigrants to learn and use their new language. "Sure, I 
nurture my memories from the 'old country.' Like everyone else, I enjoy waxing 
nostalgic to my children. But I do so in their native language. Which happens 
to be English. And you know something? My stories flow better." 
</P>
<P>
American English may be the ideal language of the free. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, you -- <PERSON>Mr. President</PERSON> -- read my lips!

<HEAD>Gov't, Citing Winnie the Pooh, Asks Bureaucrats to Use Plain
English</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s army of civil servants got new marching
orders <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>: use plain English.
   Citing such authorities as Confucius and Winnie the <ORGANIZATION>Pooh</ORGANIZATION>, a
Cabinet Office pamphlet appealed to the bureaucrats to be clear and
concise in talking to the public and to each other.
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s 500,000-member civil service has never been known for
using a word when three would do, as the pamphlet notes in citing
this 18th-century note from the <ORGANIZATION>Commissioners of Excise</ORGANIZATION> to the
Supervisor of <LOCATION>Pontefract</LOCATION>:
   ``I am ordered to acquaint you that if you hereafter continue
that affected and schoolboy way of writing, and to murder the
language in such a manner, you will be discharged for a fool.''
   The Duke of <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION> railed against official jargon as ``the
futile driveling of mere quill-driving.''
   Some of the examples given as good writing would make those
quill-drivers blanch. It quoted this note from a minister in
ancient <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> to a senior civil servant:
   ``Apollonius to <ORGANIZATION>Zeno</ORGANIZATION>, greeting. You did right to send the
chickpeas to <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>. Farewell.''
   The pamphlet was written by <PERSON>John Wright</PERSON>, head of information at
the <ORGANIZATION>Cabinet Office</ORGANIZATION>. The introduction is by Prime Minister <PERSON>Margaret
Thatcher</PERSON>, who likes to be thought of as the enemy of verbose
bureaucrats.
   ``She's a very great friend of the plain English campaign and
extremely keen on the civil service using plain English,'' said
<PERSON>Wright</PERSON>. ``She is a plain-speaking woman.''
   <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> writes: ``Too often clarity and simplicity are
overwhelmed by pompous words, long sentences and endless
paragraphs.''
   Or as the book of <LOCATION>Ecclesiastes</LOCATION> admonishes: ``Let thy speech be
short, comprehending much in few words.''
   Among the tips in the pamphlet:
   _ ``Use shorter words. Write `try' for `attempt,' `about' for
`concerning,' `more' for `additional.' Long words are often a sign
of a stodgy style that sends readers to sleep.''
   _ ``Use short sentences. Aim at an average of 15-20 words _ even
shorter if you can manage it. You can still be polite and, if need
be, formal or forceful.''
   _ ``Use jargon and abbreviations only when you're sure the
reader knows what they mean. Otherwise explain them.''
   It suggests sentences with active verbs, such as ``the
department decided that employees should work from 9 to 5'' instead
of ``the decision of the department was that employees should work
between 9 and 5.''
   Or as Confucius would say: ``If language is not correct, then
what is said is not what is meant; if what is said is not what is
meant, then what ought to be done remains undone.''
   ``Remember,'' says the pamphlet, ``readers are in a hurry to get
to the point. They don't want to be stuck in a verbal traffic jam.''
   <PERSON>Wright</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> the problem has been clearing
up in recent years. ``There's increasing use of crisp and direct
language. There's a great deal of plain English around.''
   That would please Winnie the Pooh, that bear of little brain who
signs off the pamphlet: ``Long words bother me.''

   ALL multinationals have language problems. 
But few have the troubles of the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Each day, the group struggles to conduct business in its hodgepodge of nine official languages. 
Things are so bad that the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> dedicates <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT> of its administrative budget to translation. 

   To bridge these linguistic barriers, the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> has turned to the wonders of technology -- and has begun to supplement the work of human translators with machines capable of producing raw translations in about 10 minutes. 

   But the machine translators illustrate the troubles Europeans have with technology. 
While Europeans have been quick to use the new machines -- and have been among the leaders in researching the field -- they haven't yet demonstrated the knack of bringing commercial products to market. 

   The use of machines to translate human languages took off in the mid-1970s, especially in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, where 700 million people speak more than 30 languages and devote <PERCENT>57%</PERCENT> of their international trade to dealing with each other. 

   The market for commercial products seems vast: It includes both multinationals wanting quick document translation and small translation companies needing rapidly translated first drafts. 
Such systems can help publishing houses and newspapers cut proofreading costs by checking spelling and grammar. 

   The systems can provide a framework for teaching languages too, as the West German electronics concern <ORGANIZATION>Siemens AG</ORGANIZATION> has found in its computer-aided Valerie program. 
By creating specialized dictionaries in technical fields, companies can use translation machines to teach technicians to read English. 

   Machine translation had a slow start, partly because of bad press early in its development. 
A <DATE>1966</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION> report in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> was so negative that many machine-translation companies died. 

   Many computer experts blame the linguists who dominated the field and were more interested in the intricacies of language than the practicalities of word processing. 
Another problem has been the technology's reluctant users -- language translators -- who have been the fiercest of gatekeepers. 

   <PERSON>Loll Rollings</PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>'s multilingual program, says fighting the balkiness of <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> translators has been hard: "They say: 'We get our salary whether we produce six pages a day by human translation or whether we produce 25 by machine,'" he contends. 

   On their side, translators say that while the machines may be all right for translating the language of bureaucracy, they don't do well when used on more active prose. 
"Oratory is out because it is on the warm end of the emotional scale," says <PERSON>Andrew Evans</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>'s English translation division. 
And stay away from the "icy chill of legal text or anything of an unequivocal nature" when using machine translation, he adds. 

   Today's leaders in the multibillion-dollar machine-translation market are Automated Language Processing Systems (ALPS), <LOCATION>Provo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Logos</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wellesley</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Weidner</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Northbrook</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill</LOCATION>. 
Japanese companies such as <ORGANIZATION>NEC Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Fujitsu Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Bravice International</ORGANIZATION> also are moving aggressively into the market. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NEC</ORGANIZATION> are working on vocal translation methods that would allow executives calling long distance and speaking two different languages to have the other's language translated almost instantaneously into their own. 

   The system the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> uses, <ORGANIZATION>Systran</ORGANIZATION>, was the first translation machine on the market. 
Introduced in <DATE>1970</DATE>, it's still the fastest system, but that speed comes at the expense of precision. 
"Systran is very tolerant with wrong sentences," says <PERSON>Thomas Pahl</PERSON>, a expert on <ORGANIZATION>Systran</ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION>Hennef</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>. 
"In fact, it doesn't even notice." 

   Other systems, such as ALPS, are interactive, allowing computers to ask the translator to help them when they're puzzled. 
These systems often produce slower but smoother translations. 

   All machine-translation systems have trouble with homographs -- words that have the same spelling but different meanings. 
<PERSON>Ian Pigott</PERSON>, the program director for the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Systran</ORGANIZATION>, says translation machines typically take a French verb phrase such as "nous avions" -- we had -- and translate it into English as "we airplanes." 
The mix-up comes, says <PERSON>Mr. Pigott</PERSON>, because "the machine hadn't been able to envisage the plural of planes being a verb as well." 

   Many of these homographic blunders have been cleared up by upgrading and correcting the system's dictionaries. 
But dictionary inaccuracies persist. 

   When the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> was asked not long ago to do development work for the French aircraft corporation <ORGANIZATION>Aerospatiale</ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Systran</ORGANIZATION> user, it found outdated words in its terminology banks that would have spawned low-quality translations. 
The word "engine" was listed as "moteur," the French word for an old-fashioned propeller engine, rather than as "reacteur," which means "jet engine." 

   Experts say systems such as <ORGANIZATION>Systran</ORGANIZATION> are best suited for technicians and other specialists looking for information, not polished prose. 

   At the West German nuclear research center at <LOCATION>Karlsruhe</LOCATION>, machine translation has been used to boost cooperation with nuclear scientists in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. 

   The machines translate documents from German into English and from French into English so that both groups of scientists can read them. 
Raw translations using <ORGANIZATION>Systran</ORGANIZATION> are processed at a rate of about 1,000 pages an hour, says <PERSON>F.W.A. Habermann</PERSON>, head of the facility's translation department. 
That's more than 100 times faster than by human translators, he says. 

   In <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, the keen interest in machine translation reflects persistent linguistic barriers that become trade barriers. 
Though most businessmen on the continent do the bulk of their trading within the Common Market, they frequently can't speak their neighbors' language. 
They usually sidestep the problem by speaking English together. 

   But when two European companies enter cooperative ventures, language is a barrier to collaboration: Executives often can't read tenders, patents and other documentation in the partner's language. 
"<LOCATION>First Europe</LOCATION> has to solve its own trade difficulties before we can move successfully in world markets," says <PERSON>Mr. Rollings</PERSON>. 

   Given these ambitions, it would seem that <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> would lead the way in machine-translation technology. 
But though it is arguably the largest market for machine translation, it lags the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> in this technology. 
<PERSON>Mr. Pahl</PERSON>, who runs his own software company, says the problem is a chronically European one: translating immense interest into commercial projects. 
"We experience the problem here that exists in the general area of high-tech development in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>," he says. 
"Europeans are generally too conservative. 
In the States you have an idea and you just try it. 
Here you spend days and days talking about the potential problems that could arise." 

   Despite his skepticism, <PERSON>Mr. Pahl</PERSON> calls European collaboration an ideal motive for further use. 
"If you have an Italian partner, you don't care if the German coming out of his Italian research reports is a very nice German," he says. 
"What's important is that you can understand it."

FT  09 DEC 94 / Technology: Say the word - New developments mean
speech-recognition systems may soon be a common tool
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For decades the prospect of computers capable of recognising speech has
fired the imagination of researchers and science-fiction writers alike.
But early speech-recognition systems required users to speak frustratingly
slowly, with pauses between their words.
Now, speech recognition technology could be at a turning point. As
processing power increases and prices fall, manufacturers of voice
recognition equipment, such as <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Dragon Systems</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Philips</ORGANIZATION>, are
optimistic about the prospect of making it a common, practical tool.
In <DATE>October</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Philips</ORGANIZATION> announced a breakthrough in the form of a speech
recognition system capable of recognising continuous speech, as well as
coping with more than 50,000 words. This development, it believes, makes
speech recognition 'mature enough to be used on a large scale in a wide
variety of applications'.
Its first specialist application is for radiologists, who produce dozens of
reports on clinical findings every day. <ORGANIZATION>Philips</ORGANIZATION> believes that its system
cuts the time taken to produce a report by 40 per cent.
Enthusiasts talk about speech recognition systems replacing keyboards, mice,
dictation machines, handwriting recognition equipment and even copytypists
and telephone operators. 'It will be months, rather than years, before
keyboards are redundant,' says <PERSON>Kurt Lynn</PERSON>, sales and marketing president of
Kolvox, which has developed software applications for speech recognition for
legal and office users.
<PERSON>Nicholas Stewart</PERSON>, a barrister who has tried out the Kolvox system, is not
totally convinced. He thinks competent typists will prefer keyboards for
typing long texts. Nonetheless, he thinks the system could be 'very helpful'
to barristers in coping with large amounts of administration.
<ORGANIZATION>Shoosmiths &amp; Harrison</ORGANIZATION>, a legal firm which has been using the AllVoice
DragonDictate system, is also enthusiastic. It says speech recognition saves
time, since texts no longer go back and forth to secretarial staff for
transcribing, proof-reading and revision. Moreover, it appeals to users who
are not computer literate or good typists.
The range of applications for voice recognition technology goes well beyond
dictation. In the home, voice recognition can turn on the television, dim
the lights or open the garage door. Mail order companies use speech
recognition for telephone sales.
Speech recognition systems are even being used for language training. French
drivers of the Eurostar high-speed trains are using a training program
produced by <ORGANIZATION>Cap Gemini Sogeti</ORGANIZATION>, the computer services company, which checks
each element of a user's sentence and rates their pronunciation.
The speech recognition market is currently valued at Dollars 289m (Pounds
176.2m) and is expected to grow at <MONEY>25 per cent</MONEY> a year over the next four
years to Dollars 800m by <DATE>1998</DATE>, according to <ORGANIZATION>Frost &amp; Sullivan</ORGANIZATION>, market
researchers.
Different applications of the technology call for different approaches.
Telephone-based voice recognition systems use small vocabularies because
they need to be able to recognise a wide range of voices. Their scope is
also limited by the quality of telephone microphones, the likely presence of
background noise, and the narrow bandwidth of telephone lines which render
'f' and 's' sounds indistinguishable.
As a result, the capabilities of telephone-based voice recognition systems
are typically limited to yes, no and numbers from zero to nine.
By contrast, dictation systems which require large vocabularies, of for
example 60,000 words, are trained to recognise a particular voice. It
typically takes a few hours for the machines to become attuned to the voice
of the speaker, which involves storing examples of the speaker's phonemes,
the smallest acoustical component of a language.
The process of speech recognition begins with the microphone, which
transforms a user's spoken words into an analogue signal which is then
transformed into a digital stream of ones and zeros. Decoding software then
searches for patterns that match the stored models of phonemes. This
involves complex acoustic and statistical models that calculate the
probability that a particular pattern matches a certain sound or word. The
system also uses a language model, which contains information about the way
sentences are composed and the word order in a sentence.
The easiest languages for a computer to recognise are those providing the
most clues. So languages such as German with long words and rigorous
grammatical rules are easier to recognise than, for example English. Within
the English language, some vocabularies are easier to recognise than others:
the long words and stock phrases used by lawyers, doctors and dentists make
them an attractive market for voice recognition tools.
The take-up of voice recognition technology is influenced by a number of
factors, not least of which is national culture. North Americans, who tend
to be more comfortable than Europeans and Asians about talking to machines,
provide overwhelmingly the largest market for voice technology.
Another potential obstacle arises from the feeling of confusion or even
panic that often accompanies a user's first encounter with a speech
recognition-based telephone service. 'There are a lot of unsolved problems,'
according to <ORGANIZATION>BT</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Fred Stentiford</PERSON>, who carries out research into the design
of automatic telephone dialogues. Inexperienced users speak before a prompt
has finished, hesitate, or use too many 'ums' and 'ers'. A long dialogue
that relies on simple 'yes' or 'no' answers may also deter users who find it
too tedious.
Users' growing familiarity with speech recognition systems may ease some of
these problems. But some researchers believe speech recognition systems will
only become really acceptable once there has been a breakthrough in the
theory of natural language processing, allowing a machine to cope with the
complex structure and grammar of ordinary speech.
Meanwhile, many basic aspects of speech recognition technology are capable
of considerable improvement. Researchers are trying to build systems with
larger vocabularies that can cope with continuous speech more cheaply.
'Speech recognition is a technology that is never finished,' says <PERSON>Bernie
Woollaston</PERSON>, divisional director of <ORGANIZATION>Philips Dictation System</ORGANIZATION>. 'It can always
be faster, with fewer errors.'

JACK SMITH: GRAMMAR SOUNDS GOOD WRITTEN BY EAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I feel it is time again to answer some of the many criticisms from readers 
about my alleged errors in grammar. Naturally, I choose to answer only those 
that I can offer authoritative arguments against. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Harriett Sprague</PERSON> takes me to task for this sentence (speaking of faraway 
places): "I know they won't look any different than they do in the movies and 
pictures I've seen. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
She circles the word than and comments: "From, <PERSON>Jack</PERSON>, from." 
</P>
<P>
The notion that from, not than, should follow different has many advocates, but 
the consensus of modern grammarians is that than is proper when from would have 
to be followed by an awkward phrase. 
</P>
<P>
(I might have used simply than, and dropped they do, to avoid the more awkward 
from the way they looked.) 
</P>
<P>
Bergen and <PERSON>Cornelia Evans</PERSON> are eloquent on the point in their Dictionary of 
Modern American Usage, noting that different than is found in <LOCATION>Addison</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Steele</PERSON>, 
<PERSON>Defoe</PERSON>, <PERSON>Richardson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Goldsmith</PERSON>, <PERSON>Coleridge</PERSON>, De Quincey, <PERSON>Carlyle</PERSON> and <PERSON>Thackery</PERSON>, 
among others, and that <PERSON>John Maynard Keynes</PERSON>, "another master of clear and 
beautiful prose," wrote, "How different things appear in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> than in 
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>." (His alternative to than would have been to write from the way they 
appear. 
</P>
<P>
The <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> conclude that different from is established usage and may be used in 
any construction; "But no one has any grounds for condemning others who would 
rather say different than, since this construction is used by some of the most 
sensitive writers of English and is in keeping with the fundamental structure 
of the language." 
</P>
<P>
In "American Usage and Style: The Consensus," <PERSON>Roy H. Copperud</PERSON> reports that 
different than is accepted as standard by his panel. The <ORGANIZATION>Harper Dictionary of 
Contemporary Usage</ORGANIZATION> concludes that several leading grammarians agree that "the 
use of different than is becoming more popular among careful writers when the 
object of the preposition is a clause, as in "Please inform us if your address 
is different than it was in the past." 
</P>
<P>
T. <PERSON>G. Stafford</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Ojai</LOCATION> deplores my use of the objective me in the clause "the 
daylong plunk of tennis balls struck by those more energetic than me." 
</P>
<P>
"Since you seem to put yourself forward from time to time as a grammarian," he 
says, "I felt that this occasional error should be brought to your attention. 
The correct pronoun, of course, should be I, as in 'He is shorter (or taller, 
thinner, fatter, smarter) than I (am short, tall, thin, fat, smart),' the 
latter part of the clause being understood rather than stated." 
</P>
<P>
First, I have never put myself forward as a grammarian. I write by ear, and 
usually in the vernacular. Though I have 18 feet of bookshelves devoted to the 
English language, in all its maddening perversity, I am merely a student of the 
language; I am constantly guided by reference to those works, and often misled 
into error by my ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the Evanses say: "If one says it is me, one would also say is she 
taller than me? But if one says it is I, he should also say is she taller than 
I? The objective form is generally preferred." 
</P>
<P>
A point of diction is raised by <PERSON>Carl G. McIntire</PERSON>, a speech consultant. He says 
I have misued the word bemused in the sense of amused, when it means 
"thoughtful -- to muse." I have never used bemuse to mean amuse. (Why would I?) 
I use the word bemused ironically, and perhaps <ORGANIZATION>McIntire</ORGANIZATION> is misled by the fact 
that I am often bemused by things that others find merely amusing. 
</P>
<P>
McIntire also complains about the general use of insignia as a singular noun, 
and insignias as a plural. In fact, he says, the singular is insigne and the 
plural insignia. 
</P>
<P>
Copperud notes that "both major dictionaries, as well as <ORGANIZATION>American Heritage</ORGANIZATION>, 
recognize insignia as the singular and insignias as the plural." He adds: "This 
may be regarded as the consensus." The Evanses, by the way, note that "in the 
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION> insignia is used officially as a singular and is given a regular 
English plural insignias." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, memorandums is standard as the plural of memorandum.

FT  25 JAN 92 / As They Say in Europe: Watch your tongue]
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Germans have been pleading for their language to be given appropriate
recognition in the European Community: it is, after all, the mother tongue
of a quarter of the <ORGANIZATION>Community</ORGANIZATION>'s population. In <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Daily Mail</ORGANIZATION>
newspaper has been waging a campaign to ensure English is the language of
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. French President <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> has said he will sack any of his
officials who does not use the 'world's most glorious language' when
addressing international gatherings.
All this adds up to a greater need for Britons to understand more other
languages. A little knowledge is a dangerous thing though, as I found at the
age of 12 in <LOCATION>Holland</LOCATION>. I asked a friend to tell me the Dutch for 'excuse me'
and he told me 'donder op.' I got halfway down an <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION> tram before it
dawned on me that something was wrong. I was actually saying: 'Get out of my
way,' rather rudely. It was silly because the Dutch speak everybody else's
language perfectly; if everyone was like them, there would be no trouble.
Unfortunately, most Britons are not; and there is a ghastly gamut of
pitfalls, misunderstandings and homonyms which, allied to the universal
belief that foreigners are stupid or funny or both, can lead to a lot of
ill-feeling. The English laugh at other people's English while remaining
less aware of how they can generate endless amusement in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. I have lost
count of the number of diet-conscious Britons who have asked if there were,
say, preservatifs dans le gateau. In other words, are there condoms in the
cake? The term 'cul-de-sac' is perfectly good English; but in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> for the
past 150 years, it has had to be rendered as impasse. Cul-de-sac manages to
be lavatorial and genital at one and the same time. And this is the great
problem.
Even the sight of certain words in another language can lead to jeering,
contempt and coarse allusions. No red-blooded Briton can be initiated to the
joys of the autobahn without nearly crashing the car on sighting the word
Ausfahrt at the first exit.
The Germans are defensive about their language. They know that the piling-up
of words to make new words, and the minefield of bits of verbs at the end of
sentences, is a source of mirth and irritation to other nations. But I
recall a magnificent defence of the German language in the <LOCATION>Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung</LOCATION> some years ago.
Among other things, it pointed out that other languages lacked German
precision. For example, that well-known thoroughfare in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, Old Fish
Hill Street, was absurd. Nobody could tell whether it was the fish, the hill
or the street that was old. In German, there could be no possibility of any
misunderstanding.
Misunderstandings are the norm between closely-related languages. The
Spanish find the Portuguese entertaining. Voce me deixou embaracada means
'You have embarrassed me' in Portuguese but 'You've made me pregnant' in
Spanish.
The Slavonic languages are where the fun really starts. It is not surprising
that Serbs and Croats are at each other's throats when you know that bulja
means 'head' in <LOCATION>Zagreb</LOCATION> but 'arse' in <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION>. Then there are simple
problems, such as the fact that zapominac is the Polish for 'forget.' In
Russian, it means 'memorise.'
The worst difficulties arise between Polish and Czech, as I found out some
years ago when working in that part of the world. I 'phoned a contact in
<LOCATION>Prague</LOCATION>, but the woman who answered spoke no English or German. Czech is not
my language so, drawing on my slender reserves of Polish, I said, 'I am
seeking <PERSON>Mrs Vesela</PERSON>.' My interlocutor said something like: 'I don't wish to
know that,' and slammed down the phone.
The trouble was that the Polish word for 'to seek' is szukac In Czech,
though, that word is the coarsest way of saying 'to make love.'
For sheer linguistic confusion, though, it is hard to beat the great novel
All Quiet on the <ORGANIZATION>Western Front</ORGANIZATION>. In German, that is the lapidary Im <PERSON>Westen
Nichst Neues</PERSON> which translates easily into the Polish Nic Nowiny na
Zachodziem. But that title on a book in Czech would mean 'There's no paper
in the lavatory.'

FT  12 MAR 92 / Technology: Multilinguals on the open road - As Europe's
single market approaches, Della Bradshaw examines systems that translate
documents into several languages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In less than 10 months' time there will be a single European market: but
there will not be a single European language. As a result manufacturers
wanting to sell their wares across boundaries will be forced to translate
their product information.
Ahead of the pack, <ORGANIZATION>Xerox</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> electronics company, has long translated
its technical documentation for use in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. Although translation services
have traditionally been a cottage industry, <ORGANIZATION>Rank Xerox</ORGANIZATION> turned to computer
technology for assistance.
Machines at <ORGANIZATION>Rank Xerox</ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION> now translate 10,000 pages a year from
English into 10 European languages. <PERSON>Mike Scott</PERSON>, of Rank <ORGANIZATION>Xerox</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Language
Technology Centre</ORGANIZATION>, believes the machines can at least halve the time it
takes to complete the task.
As pressure on manufacturers to reduce product lead times increases,
computers are proving ever more valuable, says <PERSON>Alan Portela</PERSON>, vice president
of marketing for <ORGANIZATION>Systran</ORGANIZATION>, of <ORGANIZATION>La Jolla</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. 'Today large corporations
that have to translate huge manuals in a short time have only one option -
machine translation.'
Manufacturers emphasise that time savings can only be achieved if the text
follows a narrowly-defined format. 'The system can only translate what has
been stated in a sentence, not what could possibly have been meant,' says
<PERSON>Thomas Schneider</PERSON>, manager in charge of linguistics and terminology at
<ORGANIZATION>Siemens-Nixdorf</ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION>Munich</LOCATION>.
This means the systems are best suited to the translation of instruction and
maintenance manuals, where the documentation is bulky but where clarity of
expression rather than elegance of phrase is required. 'They are designed to
work on logical English - not poetry,' says <PERSON>Phil Wrenn</PERSON>, senior applications
engineer at <ORGANIZATION>Intergraph</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> computer group.
Nevertheless, different types of translation machines are suited to
different types of text. Machines fall into three types:
Batch systems, where a document is fed into the computer in one language and
emerges in a second language. The <ORGANIZATION>Systran</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Siemens-Nixdorf</ORGANIZATION> machines fall
into this category.
Computer-assisted, or interactive, systems where the text is translated a
sentence at a time, and constantly checked by a human translator. If the
computer cannot find a word in the dictionary, then it will stop and prompt
the translator to help.
Computerised dictionaries, which are used as an aid by translators. Although
not as sophisticated as the first two, these dictionaries ensure that
several translators working on a single text use consistent terminology.
Batch systems are most effective for technical literature and need three
types of dictionary, says <PERSON>Jane Mason</PERSON>, language technology consultant at the
<ORGANIZATION>Rank Xerox Language Technology Centre</ORGANIZATION>. These are a general dictionary -
English to French, for example; an industry dictionary for, say, the
pharmaceuticals industry; and one developed for the specific company.
Working on short, terse sentences - <PERSON>Mason</PERSON> recommends training the authors to
write text with translation in mind - the results can be extremely
effective. A human translator using a batch system could translate between
5,000 and 10,000 words a day. Most of the manual work would be at the
'post-editing' phase, once the machine had completed its task. A human
translator working alone could manage only 1,500 words a day.
However, if inadequate preparation is done, the results can be of little
use, says <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>. 'It's a one-shot system. If it has the wrong terminology it
would repeat the error over and over again. When it is below the 70 to 80
per cent correct level, you might as well translate it sentence by
sentence.'
By comparison, interactive systems enable a translator to handle between
2,000 and 4,000 words a day, but the advantage is that they can be used for
translating more general text - sales and marketing information, for
example.
Many large <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> companies, such as <ORGANIZATION>Eastman Kodak</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>General
Dynamics</ORGANIZATION> already use machine translation systems. In <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, companies have
been more hesitant, although the German software house <ORGANIZATION>Sap</ORGANIZATION> and the German
subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Philips</ORGANIZATION> are among several large companies that have taken the
plunge.
The <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION>, too, uses computer translation systems. It has also
begun a programme to develop its own system, <LOCATION>Eurotra</LOCATION>, which will handle nine
European languages. A small-scale prototype has been developed, says <PERSON>Sergei
Perschke</PERSON>, programme manager, which can handle scientific and technical
documentation. However, he reckons it will be a further 10 years before an
operational system can be produced.
'As far as the technology is concerned, the computers are quite
appropriate,' <PERSON>Perschke</PERSON> points out. 'The main problems are linguistic.'
Each language presents its own problems, says <PERSON>Schneider</PERSON>. English has a lot
of words such as 'back', which can be a noun, adjective or participle. In
German, on the other hand, words can have an almost free word order - with
the object at the beginning of the sentence or the subject at the end.
Recent years have seen a great improvement in the software. Whereas systems
used to translate a word at a time, they now work on phrases or whole
sentences, and relate one sentence back to another. So if the sentences 'The
cat sat on the mat. It drank a saucer of milk,' were translated, the
software would recognise that the 'It' of the second sentence referred to
the cat, not the mat.
Today's machines also incorporate artificial intelligence techniques. So the
<ORGANIZATION>Intergraph</ORGANIZATION> system teaches itself to recognise the words within the context
of the article it is reading, says <PERSON>Wrenn</PERSON>. The first time it translates a
document for a particular company or industry it will get only about 45 per
cent of the words correct. But learning from the corrections it will achieve
up to 95 per cent accuracy by the time the fourth or fifth document, on a
related topic, is translated.
On the document production side <ORGANIZATION>Systran</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Siemens-Nixdorf</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Intergraph</ORGANIZATION> have
all combined translation software with publishing software, so that a
document can be produced that incorporates both text and diagrams or
photographs.
Developments in computer hardware, particularly of smaller and more powerful
machines, have also benefited machine translation customers.
<ORGANIZATION>Intergraph</ORGANIZATION>, for example, has transferred its software from a <ORGANIZATION>Digital
Equipment Vax</ORGANIZATION> machine to workstations running under the Unix operating
system and <ORGANIZATION>Siemens-Nixdorf</ORGANIZATION> plans a similar move.
However, the fall in the price of hardware is unlikely to have a striking
impact on the price of the overall system, says <PERSON>Schneider</PERSON>, as the software
has proven so expensive to develop - in the case of <ORGANIZATION>Siemens-Nixdorf</ORGANIZATION> some
DM60m (Pounds 21m).
'If you look at the development costs, the software is dirt cheap to buy,'
says <PERSON>Schneider</PERSON>. A typical system with five workstations would cost DM
250,000.
This overhead means that only large users - those translating more than
2,000 pages a year - would benefit from buying their own equipment. But both
the larger translation agencies, and some of the manufacturers, offer
services for smaller companies.
Rank <ORGANIZATION>Xerox</ORGANIZATION>, for example, sells translation services through its <ORGANIZATION>Language
Translation Centre</ORGANIZATION>. Anyone with a 200-page document for translation would
find the service economical, says <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>.
In the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Systran</ORGANIZATION> offers a range of services. Companies can even have
on-line access to the <ORGANIZATION>Systran</ORGANIZATION> database, to send their documentation over the
phone line for translation. This costs about Dollars 13 (Pounds 7.50) a page
and, says <PERSON>Portela</PERSON>, is suitable for companies that need between 50 and 100
pages a month translated.
Systran can also carry out the machine translation of a text and then send
it to a traditional translation agency to apply the post-editing polish. The
documents are then returned to the originating company in a camera-ready
form - photos and diagrams included - for printing. Portela estimates the
cost of this is about Dollars 25 a page. A traditional translator would
charge Dollars 50 a page.

If this renegade group of linguists could board a time machine, they probably 
would press the accelerator to the floor -- moving backward through the ages to 
a time before <ORGANIZATION>Sanskrit</ORGANIZATION>, English, Punjabi or Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Hurtling back to a remote part of the past before people ever learned to farm, 
past the era when humans first used fire to a period 100,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
That is the time they think they will find the critical evidence, the seedlings 
that produced all of the world's languages, something they like to call the 
Mother Tongue of Man. 
</P>
<P>
Such a discovery, this group of mostly Soviet and East European researchers 
believe, would prove what is called the monogenesis of language, the evolution 
of the spoken word from a single tongue. 
</P>
<P>
But while even these scientists think the 100,000-year mark could eventually 
prove to be too deep in the remote past, they have made headway in 
reconstructing hundreds of words they believe were spoken 15,000 to 30,000 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Historical linguist <PERSON>Vitaly Shevoroshkin</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Michigan</ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON>Ann 
Arbor</PERSON> sees a host of applications for biology and anthropology in the work he 
and his colleagues in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> have done. 
</P>
<P>
For one, the evolution of language not only shows "how some words have become 
petrified," by not changing much over time but also how people have migrated 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Yet he laments the work has generated little interest in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
To hear <PERSON>Shevoroshkin</PERSON> tell it, only a handful of Americans are interested in 
learning the words spoken by early <PERSON>Homo</PERSON> sapiens sapiens, the prehistoric humans 
whom paleobiologists believe first appeared 100,000 years ago and are the 
direct ancestors of modern people. 
</P>
<P>
Shevoroshkin theorizes that it is possible to pinpoint at least a few original 
words of man, elements from a language that served as the progenitor for all of 
those ever spoken on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to reconstruct the proto-proto-proto language, if you will, the 
Mother Tongue. 
</P>
<P>
"A proto language means a language family like Indo-European. If you say 
proto-proto that's an ancestor of a family, not everybody accepts that idea 
especially people in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"But when you say proto-proto-proto, that's something completely different. 
Perhaps we may not find the mother tongue, the language of the world, maybe we 
can go back only 30,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a big gap between people speaking some type of language 30,000 years 
ago and one spoken 100,000 years ago. That is a very big gap and we don't know 
how to fill it." 
</P>
<P>
As part of his quest, however, Shevoroshkin hopes to find the links that tie 
the world's languages together and link them to the past. 
</P>
<P>
To this end, he is building on the work of Soviet linguists <PERSON>Sergei Starostin</PERSON>, 
<PERSON>Vladislav Marakovic</PERSON> Illic-Svityc and <PERSON>Aaron Dolgopolsky</PERSON> who more than 20 years 
ago tediously reconstructed a language spoken 15,000 years ago they call 
Nostratic, which means "our language." 
</P>
<P>
Shevoroshkin said 1,000 words of Nostratic have been reconstructed by analysis 
of common elements from languages he and other scholars believe grew out of the 
ancient tongue. 
</P>
<P>
Nostratic, they believe, gave rise to the Indo-European, Afro-Asiatic, 
Kartvelian, <LOCATION>Euralic</LOCATION>, Dravidian, <LOCATION>Altaic</LOCATION> and Eskimo-Aleutian language families. 
Hence, making Nostratic a superfamily of languages, or as Shevoroshkin would 
put it -- a proto-proto language. 
</P>
<P>
His hope is to continue on to the proto-proto-proto stage, if he can find the 
clues that will link him to the remote past. 
</P>
<P>
Language is unique to the human species, <PERSON>Shevoroshkin</PERSON> said, and one of the 
primary characteristics like upright walking and a highly evolved brain that 
set humans apart from their cousin primates, the Great Apes. 
</P>
<P>
He believes by way of a technique called deep reconstruction, he can tap into 
the vocabularies of ancient humans, seeking first those elements that exist in 
every language in the world -- first and second person pronouns and names for 
parts of the body. 
</P>
<P>
Such studies produced one of the startling findings in <LOCATION>Nostratic</LOCATION>, he said. 
</P>
<P>
By studying the word for "eye" in many languages, Soviet researchers were able 
to surmise what the word was in <LOCATION>Nostratic</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"In English, the word is eye. But in German it is auge, very similar. In old 
Russian it is oko and in <LOCATION>Nostratic</LOCATION> we believe it was huka." 
</P>
<P>
Words for nature also lend themselves to historic analysis, he said, 
emphasizing that because there was no agriculture before 10,000 years ago there 
are no words for domesticated animals other than dog. 
</P>
<P>
Nostratic scholars have been able to trace that noun among others, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But even <PERSON>Shevoroshkin</PERSON> admits this is an arduous task and acknowledges that many 
historical linguists doubt he can delve too deeply into the remote past to find 
a language before Nostratic. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Stanford University</ORGANIZATION> linguistic anthropologist <PERSON>Joseph Greenberg</PERSON>, who has 
developed a technique called mass comparisons for analyzing various languages, 
is one who questions how well Shevoroshkin will do. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Greenberg</PERSON>, himself interested in the evolution of the various languages of the 
world, prefers not to seek the vocabularies of early humankind but to classify 
Earth's myriad tongues past and present. 
</P>
<P>
His work produced the classification of African languages in the <DATE>1950s</DATE>, the 
groupings generally accepted by linguists today. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Greenberg</PERSON> would not call the efforts of Shevoroshkin and his co-investigators 
futile but allowed the exercise could prove tedious. 
</P>
<P>
"There's enough to show that all human languages have a common origin," said 
<PERSON>Greenberg</PERSON>. "I think the really interesting part comes in constructing a family 
tree (of languages)." 
</P>
<P>
But the problem with family trees, <PERSON>Shevoroshkin</PERSON> said, is that it is easy to 
leave out vast groups of languages and never show how one is related to 
another. 
</P>
<P>
"Linguists divide languages into several families such as Uralic, Indo-European 
or Afro-Asiatic, and so on. They usually say they are not related and if they 
are there is no proof. 
</P>
<P>
"It is our intention to find the proof and to go beyond that," <PERSON>Shevoroshkin</PERSON> 
said of his endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
"People in this area usually talk about relationships and that makes little 
sense to me," offered <PERSON>Greenberg</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
But linguist <PERSON>Merritt Ruhlen</PERSON>, formerly of <LOCATION>Stanford</LOCATION>, acknowledged recently in the 
journal Science that Shevoroshkin probably is right, that there is an ancient 
link tying the world's languages to a common tongue.

spelled so stupidly?;   YOU CAN'T WRITE A SIMPLE SENTENCE without one of these

<HEADLINE>  THAT'S WHY
DO YOU KUH-NO-WUH HOW TO SPELL WUH-RITE RIG-HUT?  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     What we have here is a quirk of language: Pronunciation changes, but not
spelling. Pronunciation is the ultimate democratic enterprise; it can't be
controlled by government fiat or by rich snobs who talk as though they have
lockjaw. If enough people say the word "harass" with the accent on the second
syllable, instead of as a homonym of <PERSON>Harris</PERSON>, then that must be acknowledged as
an acceptable pronunciation if not the standard pronunciation.;  
Unfortunately, spelling is absurdly conservative. The reason there's a "g" at
the front of gnat is that the "g" wasn't silent back in the days of <LOCATION>King
Arthur</LOCATION>. They said "guh-nat.";   When <PERSON>King Arthur</PERSON>'s knights sat 'round the
<ORGANIZATION>Round Table</ORGANIZATION>, they said the word "knight" with a "k" sound at the start and the
"g" and "h" sounds in the middle. We've tried to figure out what that would
add up to -- something like "kun-ig-hut." No wonder pronunciations have gotten
simpler over the years.;   So why hasn't spelling changed too? Because of the
invention of the dictionary. Words were spelled all manner of ways in Old and
Middle English, but with the spread of printing technology there was a
movement toward standardization.;   "Language isn't something that a group or
country or a government has a prerogative over, so it has to be changed by a
general movement," says <PERSON>John Simpson</PERSON>, co-editor of the <ORGANIZATION>Oxford English
Dictionary.</ORGANIZATION>;   And such movements don't arise. People are insufficiently
outraged over the spelling of "pneumatic" to demand a change. (And even if
they insisted on something simpler, the powerful <ORGANIZATION>Spelling Bee Industry</ORGANIZATION> would
lobby against it.);   Our own idea is: Let's keep the psycho letters, and
start saying them. Why say "write" the normal way when you can say "Wuh-rite"?
Isn't that more straightforward? Let's be mad dogs and say the "p" in
pneumonia! Let's say the "m" in mnemonic! We'll tie those dictionary people up
in knots! (Pronounced: kuh-nots.)  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Committee Calls For New Standards For English Teaching</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAGGIE JACKSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The birthplace of English had better mind its p's
and q's and improve its English teaching methods at the same time,
according to a government study which criticizes how the language
is taught in <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION>.
   The study, released <DATE>Friday</DATE> by a government-appointed committee,
concluded that most English teachers in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> were not properly
equipped for the job and recommended that many be retrained.
   Education Secretary <PERSON>Kenneth Baker</PERSON> welcomed the report. He said
his department will incorporate its recommendations into a new
curriculum planned by Prime Minister <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON>'s
Conservative government in a major shake-up of the nation's
educational system.
   ``Most schools no longer teach old-fashioned grammar. But little
has been put in its place,'' <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> said last year when he
established the committee to study the situation.
   The 90-page report follows a yearlong inquiry by the committee
into how English is taught in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>. Panel members include <PERSON>Peter
Levi</PERSON>, professor of poetry at <ORGANIZATION>Oxford University</ORGANIZATION>; novelists <PERSON>Antonia
Byatt</PERSON> and <PERSON>Keith Waterhouse</PERSON>; broadcaster <PERSON>Robert Robinson</PERSON>; and poet
<PERSON>P.J. Kavanagh</PERSON>. They visited schools across the nation before
writing the report.
   The report says all teachers should be trained in English and
that each school should have a teacher whose sole job is to ensure
that the language is used properly.
   It adds that national standards should be established to be met
by children at the ages of seven, 11 and 16. However, the committee
rejected a return to memorizing grammar rules.
   ``We're not anxious to go back to the idea that you simply learn
these things by rote, because all the evidence is that that doesn't
in fact improve the effectiveness of the children's use of the
language,'' said Sir <PERSON>John Kingman</PERSON>, vice-chancellor of <ORGANIZATION>Bristol
University</ORGANIZATION> and head of the committee.
   Kingman rejected the notion that the new standards would
discriminate against pupils from ethnic minority groups.
   Of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s 56 million people, about 2.45 million are
non-whites, mostly immigrants from <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>
whose children were born and raised in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.
   ``The fact that they may speak a different language at home is
irrelevant, because the English language is the way they become
full members of English society,'' <PERSON>Kingman</PERSON> said.
   ``It is a way of ensuring that we do not have an underclass of
non-English speakers who are cut off from getting a job and having
a career.''
   The opposition <ORGANIZATION>Labor Party</ORGANIZATION> and the 184,400-member <ORGANIZATION>National Union
of Teachers</ORGANIZATION> also welcomed the report.
   But <PERSON>Michael Simon</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>Inner London Education
Authority</ORGANIZATION>'s English Center, said he was concerned about the notion
that all pupils must conform to a standard form of English.
   ``About <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of pupils do not speak standard English
although they speak something very close to it. Any attempt to get
kids to speak standard English will just disable them as
speakers,'' he said.
   <LOCATION>Kingman</LOCATION>, a mathematician, said English teachers were not being
trained well in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and that children were suffering.
   ``We take a fairly dim view of English teacher training,'' he
said.
   The report said that by age 7, children should read passages of
simple sentences, understand the spoken language, spell common
words and write legibly; by 11, they should use punctuation and
paragraphs, argue their case on an issue and be aware of dialects.
   It said 16-year-olds should be able to express feelings, ideas
and arguments in writing and speech, make comparisions between
English and other languages and use technical terms to describe
language.
   English is the first language of 320 million people around the
world and is spoken daily by about a billion people.

<TEXT>     Heavens. What would Shakespeare think?;    It doesn't matter. Language --

dictionaries.;    We've come a long way, baby. <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> touts its new

change over the <DATE>past 20 years</DATE>, there has been a change in the consciousness of
people as far as sexism," <PERSON>Steinmetz</PERSON> said.;    Some dictionaries define
chairwoman as "a woman acting as a chairman." <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> defines the word as
a woman who heads a meeting or committee. And they spell it two ways: women
and the alternate "womyn," which separates the men from the women.;    This is
murky stuff. <PERSON>Jonathan Latimer</PERSON>, a publisher at <ORGANIZATION>Houghton-Mifflin</ORGANIZATION>, which prints

you label things.";    <PERSON>Steinmetz</PERSON> said the new <ORGANIZATION>Random House Webster</ORGANIZATION>'s was
edited "on line," meaning that the whole dictionary was on computer before it
went to press.;    So when world events happened inconveniently, there was
time to fit them in. The reunification of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, for example, forced the
rewriting of 318 entries.;    Real life is tough on dictionaries. "Teflon,"
for example, has a new definition, spawned by the term "Teflon president." The
non-stick cookware coating now also is defined as "characterized by
imperviousness to blame or criticism.";    What's going on here?;    It's
progress.;    What do you do when someone invents a machine that dispenses
cash at the touch of a button? Well, you have to call it something, and
"automatic teller machine" now is an entry in the <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> dictionary.;

<HL> Who Says Cajun
Is Just Bad French?
Not Father Daigle
---
His Dictionary Seeks to Win
Respect for the Language;
A Guess About the Chaoui

<TEXT>
   Cajun music and food have gained wide popularity in the last decade or so, but Cajuns are still fighting to gain respectability for their language. 
Some people consider it nothing but bad French. 

   In this battle, an 86-year-old retired Catholic priest, Msgr. 
<PERSON>Jules O. Daigle</PERSON>, himself a Cajun, has become an unlikely folk hero. 
"To call Cajun bad French," he fumes, "is to call French and Italian bad Latin." 

   With <MONEY>$30,000</MONEY> of his own money and little academic support, Father <PERSON>Daigle</PERSON> last year published a 600-page dictionary of Cajun. 
It is the first large-scale work on what for 225 years was solely a spoken language. 
The language's right to respectability may remain debatable, but there is no doubting its colorfulness. 

   When exiled French-speaking Acadians began arriving in the backwaters of southern <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> around <DATE>1760</DATE>, they were poor but imaginative. 
When they encountered a white sunfish unknown in their former Canadian home, the image of the fish flopping from the water provided the name. 
In most places, the fish is a crappie, but to the Cajuns -- short for Acadians -- it is a "sac-a-lait," or bag of milk. 

   In <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, the word for frog is "grenouille," but the Cajuns borrowed an Indian term and Gallicized it into "ouaouaron," pronounced waw-wah-RHAWN, a fair approximation of a bullfrog's croaking across the marsh. 
Popcorn became what it sounded like when cooking in the pot: "tac-tac." 

   "Raccoon" poses something of a linguistic mystery. 
One Cajun version is "chaoui," pronounced shah-WEE. 
This word, too, is thought to be of Indian origin, but Father <PERSON>Daigle</PERSON> suggests another possibility. 
"There were no raccoons where the Cajuns came from," he says, "so I imagine a couple of Cajuns looking up into a tree and seeing this strange animal that looks like a cat. 
One looks at the other and says, "Un chat, oui?" -- "A cat, yes?" 

   Father <PERSON>Daigle</PERSON>'s "Dictionary of the Cajun Language" constitutes a broadside at those who have derided his native tongue as a sort of country-bumpkin patois or crude "Frenglish" not worthy of speaking, much less preserving. 
Already the book has had three printings, selling 13,000 copies at <MONEY>$20</MONEY> each. 

   Next year Father <PERSON>Daigle</PERSON> plans to publish a supplement, in part a grammar, in part an expansion of vocabulary terms. 
He says it will strengthen his claim that Cajun, while owing its roots to French, is neither a dialect nor "broken French" but a unique American language created "in <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> by Louisianians." 

   The dictionary has put Father <PERSON>Daigle</PERSON> squarely in the middle of a bubbling "galimachas" (pronounced golly-mah-CHAH), a Cajunism for mess or turmoil. 
There is much discord over just what Cajun is and whether it can or should be taught in public schools in the 23 southern <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> parishes (counties) that make up the state's Cajun belt. 

   A state-financed agency, the <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> for the Development of French in <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, galled many Cajuns by spending <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> on an elementary-school-French program that largely used Parisian teachers who often ridiculed Cajun in their classrooms. 
Though the agency has recently attempted to incorporate some Cajun instruction in the program, it wasn't so long ago that its leadership asserted that to teach Cajun was to spread illiteracy. 

   Even many <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> linguists who are sympathetic to the Cajun revival complain that Father <PERSON>Daigle</PERSON>'s dictionary overstates the case for Cajun as a separate language. 
Cajun more accurately, they say, can be divided into two major regional dialects, known as bayou Cajun and prairie Cajun, plus a jambalaya of subregional dialects. 

   "So the question is not whether you can write down Cajun French as Father <PERSON>Daigle</PERSON> has done but what Cajun French do you write down?" says <PERSON>Nolan LeCompte</PERSON>, the dean of the college of arts and sciences at <ORGANIZATION>Nicholls State University</ORGANIZATION>, who has done a great deal of research on the language. 

   Father <PERSON>Daigle</PERSON> contends that all Cajuns speak enough alike as to render regional and subregional differences insignificant. 

   In any case, <PERSON>Mr. LeCompte</PERSON> praises Father <PERSON>Daigle</PERSON>, likening his feat to <PERSON>Samuel Johnson</PERSON>'s compiling the first respectable English dictionary in <DATE>1755</DATE>. 
"He got it down on paper," <PERSON>Mr. LeCompte</PERSON> says, "and at least it's a start." 

   Father <PERSON>Daigle</PERSON>'s effort seems all the more remarkable considering what happened in <DATE>1913</DATE>: <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>'s Anglo-dominated government officially banished all French from the state's schoolyards in an effort to "mainstream" the Cajuns. 
The Cajun language went into a rapid decline, notes <PERSON>Carl Brasseaux</PERSON>, assistant director of the Center for <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> Studies at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Southwestern Louisiana</ORGANIZATION> (USL) in <LOCATION>Lafayette</LOCATION>. 

   For a generation of Cajun children who faced punishment at school for speaking the language of their homes, Cajun would become a social stigma associated with backwater ways and ignorance. 
As adults, most of them simply declined to pass the language on to their children, so that by <DATE>1950</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr. Brasseaux</PERSON> says, it seemed headed for oblivion. 

   Today there are probably about 900,000 south Louisianians of Cajun ancestry, and perhaps half of them still speak Cajun. 
But the number under 25 years old who speak it is minuscule, a trend some think irreversible. 

   Efforts now are being made to teach Cajun in <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>. 
USL offers a course built on standard French constructions, and some school districts have tried sporadically to at least "Louisianify" the French they offer to students. 
But such efforts have been stymied lately. 
Money for instruction and research has been cut because of the state's depressed oil economy. 

   There is also that problem of definition. 
Just what is the Cajun language? 

   First, it is a blend of at least three kinds of French: the French spoken by those who migrated from <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> to French-controlled <ORGANIZATION>Acadia</ORGANIZATION> (now <LOCATION>Nova Scotia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Brunswick</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Prince Edward Island</ORGANIZATION>) in the early 1600s; the French that evolved during 150 years of life there; and the French developed south and west of <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION> after the British in <DATE>1755</DATE> brutally expelled the Acadians who wouldn't swear allegiance to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>. 

   When, over the years, their French didn't provide terms for some of the realities of their new <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> world, the Cajuns simply borrowed. 
"Bayou" is an Indian term. 
"Gumbo" came from blacks who still maintained snippets of their African dialect. 
English contributed "pipeline" (pronounced peep-LEEN) and car (pronounced char) and a host of other terms. 

   The Cajuns also showed a fondness for English grammar, tossing out most of the irregular verbs of standard French. 
And they settled, as English has done, on a single word for "you," the informal "tu." 

   There are other complications. 
Owing largely to settlement patterns and natural barriers such as bayous and swamps, Cajun splintered into numerous dialects. 
Father <PERSON>Daigle</PERSON>'s dictionary, say <ORGANIZATION>Nicholls</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. LeCompte</PERSON> and other students of Cajun, mainly chronicles the French of the Cajun prairie, the rice-farming flatlands that include the monsignor's home town of <LOCATION>Welsh</LOCATION> and the oil-drilling hub of <LOCATION>Lafayette</LOCATION>. 

   But in the Cajun bayous, typified by the southeastern <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> towns of <LOCATION>Houma</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Thibodaux</LOCATION>, the Acadians interspersed themselves among large numbers of so-called Creoles. 
These immigrants had come directly from <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, and their French was closer to the standard French of the time. 

   Modern bayou Cajun, then, is a blend of Acadian and standard French. 
Separated from prairie Cajun by the imposing swamps of the <LOCATION>Atchafalaya Basin</LOCATION>, it tended to develop its own idiosyncrasies. 
So did the language in some communities within these larger regions. 

   Thus, while "Qu'est qu'il y a?" is a fairly common way of posing the question "What's the matter?" 
Cajun French has at least seven other ways of asking the same question, depending upon the town or region of the speaker, says <PERSON>Richard Guidry</PERSON>, a language specialist with the state's education department. 

   Similarly, there are some confusing differences in terms, <PERSON>Mr. Guidry</PERSON> adds. 
The word "gallette (pronounced gah-YET), for instance, in most of Cajun country means a cookie or cake. 
But in some Cajun subregions, says <PERSON>Mr. Guidry</PERSON>, it has a rather specific sexual meaning. 

   "Thus, my grandfather knows that my grandmother bakes a good gallette," he says, "but if she went to the town of <LOCATION>Ville Platte</LOCATION> offering to sell it, he would become very upset."
