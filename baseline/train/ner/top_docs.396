<HEAD>Silly Putty Stretches Into Its 40th Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Forty years after a copy writer for a small
advertising agency took a taffy-like substance invented by accident
and called it Silly Putty, the toy in the plastic egg is still
making an impression.
   <ORGANIZATION>Binney &amp; Smith Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Silly Putty</ORGANIZATION>'s maker, sells more than 3
million eggs a year of the bounceable, moldable, stretchable toy
capable of lifting images from newspapers.
   And this <DATE>spring</DATE>, the Easton-based company plans to add four
fluorescent colors of Silly Putty to the pinkish silicone rubber.
   These colors mark the first change in the product since <PERSON>Peter C.
Hodgson</PERSON> borrowed <MONEY>$147</MONEY> in <DATE>1950</DATE> to market a researcher's failed
attempt at making synthetic rubber during World War II.
   ``Dads and moms may get a little jealous because they didn't
have these things, but maybe their kids will share,'' said <PERSON>Dennis
Malloy</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Binney &amp; Smith</ORGANIZATION>'s director of business development.
   The privately held company, which also makes Crayola crayons and
Liquitex fine arts products, bought the rights to Silly Putty in
<DATE>1977</DATE>, a year after <PERSON>Hodgson</PERSON>'s death.
   <PERSON>Hodgson</PERSON>'s son, <PERSON>Peter Jr.</PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION>Silly Putty</ORGANIZATION>'s simplicity has
allowed it to stretch over two generations.
   ``It demands something of people so it animates you,'' said
<PERSON>Hodgson</PERSON>, a professor of Russian literature at the <ORGANIZATION>University of
California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>.
   ``It really is what it says it is: a liquid solid,'' he said.
``It's just a paradox, a kind of puzzle, an enigma you can hold in
your hand.''
   The elder <PERSON>Hodgson</PERSON>, who envisioned Silly Putty as a therapeutic
diversion for adults, began the business in a converted barn in
<LOCATION>North Branford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, and shipped the product to retailers in
pasteboard egg crates.
   Since then, more than 200 million eggs of Silly Putty _ more
than 3,000 tons _ have been sold.
   Silly Putty, which has survived copycats such as Nutty Putty and
<PERSON>Goofy Goo</PERSON>, has been pressed into service in some unusual ways.
   The elder <PERSON>Hodgson</PERSON> gave Apollo 8 astronauts Silly Putty in
sterling silver eggs for their <DATE>1968</DATE> trip to the moon, and they used
it to keep tools from floating away in weightlessness.
   Athletes squeeze it to strengthen their hands, and physical
therapists recommend it for patients recovering from hand or wrist
injuries.
   And <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> artist <PERSON>George Horner</PERSON> uses Silly Putty in his
work, which sells for as much as <MONEY>$5,000</MONEY>.
   ``I do consider myself a serious artist even though I work with
Silly Putty,'' said <PERSON>Horner</PERSON>, whose works inside Silly Putty-filled
frames address topics such as homelessness and AIDS. ``I sort of
like to fool people's expectations.''
   <PERSON>Malloy</PERSON> said he expects Silly Putty to continue to thrive _ even
in the age of the video game.
   ``I think a parent is ecstatic when a child requests a toy that
costs a buck and a half,'' he said.
   According to <PERSON>Malloy</PERSON>, baby boomers' children have hatched a Silly
Putty sales increase of <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>17 percent</PERCENT> during the last
four years.
   He said he expects sales to grow by <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT>
this year as children collect the new blue, green, yellow and
magenta colors scheduled to reach retail stores' shelves in <DATE>May</DATE>.
   But <PERSON>Larry Carlat</PERSON>, editor of Toy &amp; Hobby World, said he didn't
think children would collect the different colors.
   ``Silly Putty is more of a one-trick pony,'' he said.
   At the modern plant in northeastern <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Binney &amp; Smith</ORGANIZATION>
makes an average of 300 pounds a day of Silly Putty, about 12,000
eggs a day.
   To make Silly Putty, silicone rubber is first swirled in
225-pound blobs with ingredients to keep it from puddling.
   After the pink goo _ warm from the stirring _ is poured from the
vat designed to mix mortar, it is cut up into chunks resembling
oversized loaves of homemade bread.
   These are then fed through a machine designed for cutting taffy.
Rows of Silly Putty drop onto a conveyer, and workers place the
13.3-gram disks resembling chopped hot dogs into red plastic eggs.
   <PERSON>Malloy</PERSON> said he expected the old-fashioned pink putty to continue
to sell well despite the bright colors and other innovations on the
drawing board.
   ``This isn't the last you'll see of new things in Silly Putty,''
he promised.

   You Can Call It Silly, but the Stuff
   Definitely Has a Nice Wring to It

   SAN FRANCISCO -- For David Latimer, "Silly Putty was
definitely a big part of my youth." It represents a simpler
time, he says, before high-tech, high-priced video games. It
also "made really good G.I. Joe or Barbie brains."
   Mr. Latimer is co-organizer of a party planned for
tomorrow night, honoring 40 years of Silly Putty popularity.
The gala event will include showings of vintage Silly Putty
commercials, a punk trombone band and a special appearance by
the granddaughter of the man who put the putty into the hands
of the masses.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   To commemorate one of the favorite uses for Silly Putty --
pressing it onto a newspaper or comic book and transferring
the image to the putty -- the party will also feature a
"transfer" booth, hosted by people wearing clothes made out
of newspaper. (This classic use has been somewhat thwarted by
technology. "It won't work on the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> newspapers
because they use new nonsmear ink," says <PERSON>Dennis Juarez</PERSON>, owner
of <ORGANIZATION>Spike's Cafe</ORGANIZATION>, the club throwing the party).
   The event wraps up a yearlong celebration for the goo,
which was introduced commercially on <DATE>March 6, 1950</DATE>. As part
of the festivities, <ORGANIZATION>Binney &amp; Smith</ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Hallmark Cards</ORGANIZATION> unit
that now makes the putty, created a 500-pound Silly Putty
birthday cake and commissioned a <MONEY>$5,000</MONEY> piece of Silly Putty
artwork. And retailer <ORGANIZATION>Neiman Marcus</ORGANIZATION> offered sterling silver
Silly Putty eggs for <MONEY>$95</MONEY>.
   Silly Putty was a war baby. A <ORGANIZATION>General Electric</ORGANIZATION> scientist
in <LOCATION>New Haven</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, stumbled upon its formula while trying
to make synthetic rubber during World War II. In a vain
attempt to find a use for the stuff, <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION> sent samples to
engineers around the world.
   Eventually, a New Haven toy-store owner brought the putty
to the attention of marketing consultant <PERSON>Peter Hodgson</PERSON>. "He
was the genius who had the insight" to mold the putty into a
commercial success, says <PERSON>Brad Drexler</PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Binney
&amp; Smith</ORGANIZATION>, which acquired Silly Putty rights after <PERSON>Mr.
Hodgson</PERSON>'s death in <DATE>1976</DATE>.
   About 200 million Silly Putty eggs have been sold in the
past four decades. Currently, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> is in the midst of a
Silly Putty renaissance, spurred by the introduction of
fluorescent putty and this year's new glow-in-the-dark
version. Sales rose <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT> last year, to six million eggs.
Children are the main putty buyers, but <PERSON>Mr. Drexler</PERSON> says that
"when adults get hold of it, they still find things to do
with it."

AUTO BODY FILLER WORKS ON CRACKS, HOLES IN WOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A.J. HAND, Distributed by the Los Angeles Times Syndicate. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years I've been pushing polyester auto body filler as one of the best 
materials there is for filling holes, dents, cracks and gouges in wood. 
Reasons? It's easy to apply. It sets up in a matter of minutes, never shrinks 
or cracks no matter how large the repair, it sands easily and finishes very 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Its only real drawback? Depending upon the brand you buy, it usually comes out 
a gray or dirty grayish pink. That's not exactly the shade you'd look for if 
you want a good wood-tone color match under a clear finish. For this reason, I 
normally use the stuff only when I plan to subsequently cover it up, with 
either a couple coats of paint or perhaps some plastic laminate. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, however, <PERSON>Minwax</PERSON> came out with a product called High Performance 
Wood Filler. Like polyester auto body filler, it comes in two parts: a can of 
putty and a tube of hardener. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as I saw it on the hardware store shelf, I surreptitiously popped open 
the can and took a look. A quick sniff revealed the telltale odor of polyester. 
The color was, if not a perfect wood-tone, at least in the neighborhood. I'd 
call it a warm, brownish gray. Not only that, according to the label, this 
stuff could be stained! Although it cost about three times as much as auto body 
filler, it sounded good. I decided to buy a can and compare it to my old 
standby. 
</P>
<P>
I quickly discovered that it handles just like auto body filler. As with auto 
body filler, the goo in the can is composed of a liquid resin combined with 
powdered fillers to create a puttylike material. As with body filler, the two 
components tend to separate with storage so it pays to stir the can before use. 
</P>
<P>
After stirring, scoop out a blob big enough to handle the job you have in mind, 
and mix it with a bit of the hardener from the separate squeeze tube. Body 
fillers usually come with a rusty red hardener. This makes it easy to see when 
you've done a good job of mixing, but it also gives you that dirty pink color 
mentioned earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The hardener with the <LOCATION>Minwax</LOCATION> filler is basically colorless. This makes it a bit 
harder to judge how well you've mixed your putty, but it also avoids that 
sickly grayish pink. 
</P>
<P>
Once either product is mixed with its hardener, you should apply it without 
delay. Depending upon how much hardener you've used, and the ambient 
temperature, the mix may set up pretty quickly. Use a flexible putty knife and 
hold it at a low angle. This helps force the putty into the defect you are 
filling. 
</P>
<P>
Since neither product shrinks, there's no need to overfill as you must with 
many other products. Just smooth the filler on and level. Avoid holding the 
knife at a steep angle, however. This tends to drag the filler out of the 
defect and you won't get a level coverage. 
</P>
<P>
On with the tests. Once my samples were mixed, I applied them to shallow 
one-inch holes drilled into ordinary pine. Ten minutes later, when the samples 
had set up, I tried staining them. According to the <LOCATION>Minwax</LOCATION> directions, you 
should sand the filler lightly with 100-grit paper (finer paper closes the 
pores of the filler so it takes less stain) and apply your stain while the 
filler is freshly cured. You should then let the stain penetrate for an hour 
before wiping off the excess. I followed those directions on the <LOCATION>Minwax</LOCATION> filler, 
using a Minwax stain. And while I was at it, I tried the same procedure on my 
grayish pink auto body filler samples. 
</P>
<P>
Results? To my surprise, once the stain was on, there wasn't much difference in 
color between the two products. The auto body filler was just a tad pinker than 
the <LOCATION>Minwax</LOCATION> filler, but to be honest, neither was really a very good match for 
the color of the stained pine surrounding the test patches. 
</P>
<P>
Of course you will probably get different results with different stains and 
different woods, but my initial reaction is that neither body filler nor the 
<LOCATION>Minwax</LOCATION> wood filler is a good choice if you want an accurate color match under a 
clear finish. For accurate color matching, you'll probably get a better job 
with stick shellac, or a product such as Plastic Wood, especially if you take 
the time to blend two or more colors together to get the exact shade you like. 
</P>
<P>
But for filling under paints or laminates, for repairing plaster and wallboard, 
for anchoring screws, and working indoor or out, polyester fillers are still my 
first choice. And given its clear-cut price advantage, I'll stick with ordinary 
auto body filler, stuff with names such as Bondo, White Lightning or Black 
Knight.

   There's one rare black mink coat for a mere
<MONEY>$50,000</MONEY>, a gem-encrusted butterfly brooch for a quarter million,
and a <LOCATION>New Orleans Mardi Gras</LOCATION> excursion for about six grand.
   For less extravagant shoppers, how about the lead item in this
year's <ORGANIZATION>Neiman Marcus Christmas</ORGANIZATION> catalogue: His and Hers <DATE>1990</DATE>
``chairpersons.''
   Straight-backed wooden chairs designed by artist <PERSON>Philip Grace</PERSON>
become life-size portraits of your choice. At <MONEY>$6,000</MONEY> each, they're
art you can really use.
   ``People are always interested in seeing what we have for the
His and Hers gifts. Every year we look for something that hasn't
been done before,'' said <PERSON>Jan Roberts</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Neiman</ORGANIZATION> vice president of
public relations in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   ``Some years they're really expensive gifts, some years they're
animals. It doesn't always have to have the same feel,'' she said.
   The tony, Dallas-based department store on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> began sending
out 3 million copies worldwide of its holiday wish book famous for
items ranging from the silly to the sublime.
   This year there's the usual Russian caviar packed in gold-lined
tins at <MONEY>$295</MONEY> per gram, as well as knickknacks, clothes, food and
other things, many at regular department store prices.
   In the one-of-a-kind category is an original Gypsy house
trailer, ornately carved and painted, supposedly ``once both home
and transportation to an important English Gypsy.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Roberts</PERSON> said the caravan, obtained from a <LOCATION>Midwestern</LOCATION>
collector is ``really spectacular ... a little museum on wheels.''
   ``We will probably sell it,'' she said.
   She said the company already has received inquiries about
another singular item _ <PERSON>Napoleon</PERSON>'s spectacles.
   The gold-rimmed reading glasses used by the French emperor,

   Finding a chip, gouge or hole on a piece of furniture does not
mean it's ruined. Damaged furniture can be restored with a patching
material made just for wood.
   Most furniture will receive some damage with heavy use. Chances
are that furniture bought at a yard sale or auction will have at
least one chip or gouge.
   Restoring furniture is simple, rewarding, and saves money on
professional repair bills. The trick is knowing what materials to
use and how to do the work.
   For your repair work, a premixed, synthetic compound gives good
results. One kind is made of latex and pulverized wood for a patch
of maximum workability and woodlike texture.
   For generations, cabinet-makers made their own patching material
by mixing hot animal glue or vinyl resin with fine sawdust. Some
purists still make their own wood patch, substituting woodworkers
glue for animal glue.
   Synthetic latex compounds are easy to use. You apply them from
the container with a putty knife, or directly into voids from a
plastic squeeze tube. They can be nailed, sawed, sanded or drilled,
and can be used for repairs both indoors and out.
   Patching damaged furniture, whether unfinished, painted or
stained, is easy enough for any do-it-yourselfer.
   First, to remove dirt, grease, oil and loose particles from the
damaged area, rub the surface with a lint-free cloth dampened with
mineral spirits, paint thinner, or a liquid sander.
   Wait 30 minutes for the surface to dry, then dampen the area to
be repaired with water. Water stops the wood from absorbing
moisture in the latex wood patch. Otherwise, the patching material
cures too quickly and might shrink and crack.
   <PERSON>John Molski</PERSON>, technical director of <ORGANIZATION>United Gilsonite
Laboratories</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Scranton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, offers these tips for using a latex
wood putty:
   ``Press the patching material tightly into the void with a putty
knife. Fill holes that are less than one-quarter inch deep and wide
in one application. Make sure the patch is slightly higher than the
surrounding wood.
   ``Wipe off the excess material around the hole with a dampened
cloth. When the patch is dry, sand it until it's level with the
surrounding surface.''
   Holes more than one-quarter inch deep and wide, <PERSON>Molski</PERSON> says,
should be filled with several layers of patch. Let each layer dry
befre applying the next.
   Sand the repair, using medium-grade sandpaper attached to a
sanding block. Failure to use a sanding block can result in ripples
on the patch and surrounding wood. This is especially true when
sanding softwoods like pine.
   Always sand with the wood grain. When done, wipe the surface
with a tack cloth or clean rag dampened with mineral spirits to
remove dust.
   The drying time for wood patching products differs. Read the
label before sanding, painting or staining.
   Follow normal surface preparations before refinishing the
damaged area.
   A refinishing tip: to improve the color match between the latex
patch and the wood, mix some finish with the patching material
before repairing the damage. Test the patch on an inconspicuous
part of the wood _ the underside of a table, for instance _ to see
if it blends with the original finish.
   If you have trouble matching the patch with a stained surface,
mix a combination of maple, mahogany and walnut stain with the
patching compond. With a little work, you can match almost any
stain using these three colors.
   Do not confuse wood patching products with paste wood fillers.
The fillers are designed for filling the open grains in certain
hardwoods like oak, mahogany and walnut prior to finishing.
   Hiding minor scratches does not require the use of a wood patch.
For a simple fix, rub a wet tea bag or shoe polish on the scratch.
Specially designed wax sticks can also be used. They are available
in different colors.
   If you're looking for the country look, repair major damage such
as broken legs or rotted wood, but leave surface blemishes and
minor scratches alone. These random markings give the piece its
character.

<LEADPARA>  ONE of the challenges of living in older houses is opening windows that have
gotten stuck. But wooden double-hung windows sometimes stick tight or bind if
left closed for long periods of time. Here's what to do about them.;    Before
struggling with a stuck window, be sure that it is unlocked and that there are
no hidden fasteners such as security bolts preventing the sashes from moving.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Home  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  OPEN THAT WINDOW
CARE AND PATIENCE ARE REQUIRED WHEN THE OLDER
ONES GET STUCK  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Do It Yourself  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     If these are not the problem, check for paint binding the sashes to the
frame. To free sashes that have been painted shut, score the seams of the
window along the tracks and the top and bottom of the frame.;    Use either a
utility knife or a tool called a paint zipper, which has a serrated blade. If
the exterior of the window has been painted recently, score the seams from the
outside if possible.;    After scoring, hold a wood block against the sashes
where they touch the seams. Hammer gently against it. Be careful not to break
the glass; wear safety goggles as a precaution.;    If hammering does not
work, force a corner of a stiff-bladed putty knife into the seam, then gently
hammer the end of the handle. While hammering, pivot the blade to embed the
entire edge about an inch deep. Then wiggle the knife back and forth to widen
the seam and break loose any paint inside.;    If the window still will not
budge, or if it binds while sliding in the tracks, get a block of wood about
1/16th of an inch thicker than the width of the window tracks.;    Hammer the
block into each track as close as possible to the stuck window; this will
widen the tracks by spreading their sides.;    Another way to free a lower
sash from the outside is to pry upward at the corners on the underside using a
wide pry bar. Protect the sill with a piece of thin plywood; protect the sash
with the blade of a putty knife placed between it and the pry bar.;    To free
an upper sash from the outside, you must pry away the molding strips, or
stops, at the sides and top.;    Use a stiff-bladed putty knife and a hammer,
and wear goggles. With the stops off, the window is held only at the sides by
the sash cords or other balance mechanisms and can fall out.;    If a window
sash binds but is not stuck, scraping and smoothing the exposed parts of the
tracks usually cures the problem.;    Use a small hook scraper or an old
chisel held with its beveled side against the surface to remove dirt and
accumulated paint from the corners as well as from the flat portions.;    If
the paint is thick, soften it with paint remover or a heat gun, then scrape
the paint with a narrow putty knife.;    Wear a filter-paper mask to avoid
breathing dust that may contain lead. Never use a torch to remove paint; its
heat can start a fire and also produce fumes. Collect paint chips in a bag and
put it in the trash.;    After removing the paint, sand the tracks smooth with
fine-grit sandpaper wrapped around a wood block. Wipe the tracks clean and
apply primer to any bare spots.;    After the primer dries, apply a thin coat
of finish paint. When it dries, lubricate the tracks with silicone or Teflon
spray or rub them with a candle.;    The sashes can be removed for repair or
for reconditioning the tracks. Start with the lower sash. Pry off one of the
stop molding strips on the indoor side of the frame using a stiff-bladed putty
knife and a hammer.;    The lower sash can then be pivoted out of the frame
while the bottom rests on the sill. Before removing it, detach the sash cords,
chains or balance mechanisms.;    When unfastening sash cords or chains, tie
each one to a screwdriver or long nail before letting go. Otherwise, the
counterweight on the other end will drop, carrying the cord or chain into the
wall, where it will be difficult to retrieve.;    Balance mechanisms can be
unscrewed from the sashes; this may have to be done before the sash can be
pivoted. Because the springs are under tension when the sash is down, grip
each one firmly as you free it, and allow it to retract gradually.;    To
remove an upper sash from indoors, you must first remove the lower sash. Then
remove one of the center molding strips, called parting stops, which divide
the sides of the frame into separate tracks. If the sash is stuck fully
raised, you will have to remove both parting stops and the head stop across
the top.;    Parting stops usually are inset in grooves. Score the paint along
the stop's edges, then grip the stop near the lower end with a pair of pliers
and pull perpendicular to the wall. With luck, the stop will come away. If it
breaks, replace it at a lumberyard.;    To reinstall the sashes, fit the upper
one into place. Reattach the sash cords, chains or balance mechanism.;    Then
reinstall the parting stop and head stop if removed, or the outer stops.
Finally, install the inner sash and its stop.;    When fastening stops, leave
a space about the thickness of a credit card between them and the sashes to
prevent binding.  </TEXT>

STUCK WITH THE DOGS OF WINTER; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETING: AS RETAILERS ADD UP THEIR HOLIDAY SALES, SEVERAL MUCH-BALLYHOOED 
PRODUCTS STAND OUT AS DUDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Neon bicycle pants and T-shirts flickered out. Books about the environment are 
heading to the dump. And the movie "Bonfire of the Vanities" is going up in 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
In a Christmas season of weak consumer spending and widespread economic pain, 
these seem to be among the biggest commercial flops. 
</P>
<P>
Marketers went into the holidays knowing that Americans were worried about the 
economy and reluctant to part with their dollars. So, many merchants took few 
chances -- by and large, they stocked their shelves with conservative fashions 
or products that appeared to be proven winners. 
</P>
<P>
Stores also tried to keep their inventories lean to avoid getting stuck with 
piles of surprise losers. "We didn't have any big dogs," said <PERSON>Gail Dorn</PERSON>, a 
spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION>Target Stores</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there were Christmas duds aplenty. Take, for example, the parade of 
dolls designed to compete with <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION>'s ever-popular <ORGANIZATION>Barbie</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Among them were <ORGANIZATION>Matchbox</ORGANIZATION>'s Real Models, including likenesses of <PERSON>Christie 
Brinkley</PERSON>, <PERSON>Cheryl Tiegs</PERSON> and <PERSON>Beverly Johnson</PERSON>. They found out that <ORGANIZATION>Barbie</ORGANIZATION> is one 
tough cookie. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who goes against <ORGANIZATION>Barbie</ORGANIZATION> gets their head handed to them," said <PERSON>Larry 
Carlat</PERSON>, editor of the trade publication <ORGANIZATION>Toy &amp; Hobby World</ORGANIZATION>. "Most little 
girls see these dolls as <ORGANIZATION>Barbie</ORGANIZATION>'s friends, and girls would rather have <ORGANIZATION>Barbie</ORGANIZATION> 
than a friend." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, action figures aimed mainly at boys -- among them, <ORGANIZATION>Beetlejuice</ORGANIZATION> and 
Police Academy characters -- were thrashed by the <ORGANIZATION>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</ORGANIZATION>, 
a repeat hit from last <DATE>Christmas</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Not that all of last year's hot toys thrived again this year. Sales of <ORGANIZATION>Micro 
Machines</ORGANIZATION> -- inch-long replicas of cars -- sped downhill. In fact, many 
consumers turned away from the favorites of past years in the toy business and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Carlat</PERSON> said the action figures based on the hit television show, "The 
Simpsons," weren't "an out-and-out bomb or a stiff, but they didn't do nearly 
as well as expected." He said the figures arrived in toy stores too late, in 
<DATE>October</DATE>, after "Simpson mania" subsided. 
</P>
<P>
This year's books about the environment arrived too late and too numerous. 
"None of them sold," said an executive for Crown Books, the biggest bookseller 
in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>. "By the Christmas of <DATE>1990</DATE>, people had had enough." 
</P>
<P>
"They all are on recycled paper, but it's still going to mean throwing away a 
lot of paper," the executive added. "That's the ironic thing." 
</P>
<P>
One of Crown's biggest disappointments: "Just a Dream," a children's story 
about ecology, written by <PERSON>Chris Van Allsburg</PERSON>, author of the previous 
best-seller "Polar Express." 
</P>
<P>
Expensive gift and coffee table books also faltered, with the <MONEY>$30</MONEY> price level 
being a breaking point. But there was at least one major exception to the rule: 
One of the season's biggest hits was "The Civil War: An Illustrated History," a 
companion to the public television miniseries. It sold at some chains for the 
full list price of <MONEY>$50</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, cookbooks staged a comeback. Biographies and autobiographies also 
did relatively well, including books about movie actress <PERSON>Ava Gardner</PERSON>, football 
and baseball star <PERSON>Bo Jackson</PERSON> and television newsman <PERSON>Charles Kuralt</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
But former President <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON>'s memoir, "An American Life," was a 
disappointment even though it made the best-seller lists. It trailed "Millie's 
Book," the dog's-eye view of the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> ghost-written by First Lady 
<PERSON>Barbara Bush</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a joke in the industry," said <PERSON>Neal Webb</PERSON>, marketing director for 
<ORGANIZATION>Ingram Book Co.</ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's biggest book wholesalers. 
</P>
<P>
In the fashion business, the neon fad faded, particularly on skin-tight bicycle 
pants. Why? 
</P>
<P>
"The bulk of the baby boomers are now past 40, and they can't afford 
liposuction," said <PERSON>Alan Millstein</PERSON>, publisher of Fashion Network Report. 
</P>
<P>
Loose sweat suits fared much better, and men's neckties with bold or playful 
prints were an undisputed hit. 
</P>
<P>
Other mass market fashion flops were corduroy, cowboy boots and, in particular, 
suede and leather coats. Millstein explained that because leather is so 
durable, many people who bought flight jackets and other leather apparel in 
past years don't need to replace it yet. 
</P>
<P>
In the sluggish consumer electronics business, electronic piano keyboards were 
probably the biggest disappointment, said <PERSON>Louis Block</PERSON>, vice president of 
merchandising for the Philadelphia-based Silo chain. After several years of 
selling briskly, keyboards are being hurt by competition from <ORGANIZATION>Nintendo</ORGANIZATION> and 
other video games, <PERSON>Bloch</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest hits of the season, though, also was a consumer electronics 
product: the <MONEY>$60</MONEY> Video Plus, an easy-to-use remote-control device for 
programming VCRs. 
</P>
<P>
Along with buying gifts, people normally flock to the movies during the 
holidays. This year, though, such highly promoted films as "Bonfire of the 
Vanities" and "<LOCATION>Havana</LOCATION>" have gotten off to weak starts. "Rockie V" also has been 
less than a knockout. 
</P>
<P>
Their box office receipts may have been hurt by the glut of holiday season 
releases, with nine major films coming out since <DATE>Dec. 19</DATE>. In some cases, pans 
by critics may have hurt too. 
</P>
<P>
Citing two of the biggest Christmas hits, "Kindergarten Cop" and "Home Alone," 
analyst <PERSON>Jeffrey Logsdon</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Seidler Amdec Securities</ORGANIZATION> suggested that "stories won 
out over stars." He said moviegoers also seem interested in cheerful stories, 
perhaps as an escape from all of the economic gloom. 
</P>
<P>
A notable exception was the explosive box office debut on Christmas Day of "The 
Godfather Part III," which <PERSON>Logsdon</PERSON> attributed partly to the loyal following 
developed by the first two Godfather movies. 
</P>
<P>
Novelty items, as usual, had mixed results. Neiman Marcus stores, the tony 
retailer long known for its fancy, unconventional gifts, fared well with its 
<MONEY>$95</MONEY> Silly Putty in an engraved sterling silver egg. The chain also succeeded 
with the 18-karat Golden Slinky, which went for <MONEY>$55</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Neiman Marcus</PERSON>' 25-hour clock, costing <MONEY>$82</MONEY>, was a disaster. Its claim to 
fame is that it shaves 2.4 seconds off of every minute, but what purpose that 
serves is anyone's guess. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess people don't want more hours in the day, they want fewer," said <ORGANIZATION>Neiman 
Marcus</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Pat Zajac</PERSON>. "It must have something to do with stress 
management."

insulating material, to the glass adjacent to the putty. Don't use more heat
than what is required to soften the putty and don't chip the putty out; wait
until it softens.;   Q I've had new carpet installed and now several doors
stick. How can I trim the doors without repainting them?;   A Very carefully!
Don't trim off too much. Remember the old saying, "measure twice and cut
once.";   Wrap masking tape around the door bottom. The tape should be wider
than what will be trimmed off, as you will mark your cutting line on it, and
it will also help keep the cut edge from splintering. With a pencil, mark the
tape at a point not more than 14 inches above the highest point of the floor
covering.;   Remove the door. Use a straight edge and a sharp knife to score
through the tape and into the surface of the door along the line to be cut.;  
Clamp a piece of wood across the door as a saw guide, adjusting the distance
from the cutting line for either a hand or power saw. (If using a power saw,
tape the foot -- the underside -- of the saw to prevent scratching the door.)
Use a sharp blade and cut slowly and evenly.;   Remove the masking tape by
peeling it off toward the cut. Seal the cut edge with a good quality primer or
wood sealer to retard moisture being "wicked-up" into the door.;   Q When I
install a vanity on a ceramic tile floor, how do I get a tight fit to the
floor? It seems if you don't get a tight fit, dust and water could get under
the vanity.;   A Once you have the cabinet scribed and cut for a tight fit to
the wall and the best fit you can obtain to the floor, make a "snake" out of
plumber's putty and adhere it to the surfaces of the cabinet that will touch
the tiles. Put the cabinet in place and apply downward pressure and twist at
the same time, the same procedure as setting a toilet in place. Then secure
the cabinet to the wall.  </TEXT>

ASK THE HANDYMAN: NEW DOORJAMB MAY OUTSHINE A PUTTY JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: While maneuvering a trailer into my garage, I made a mistake and put 
a large gash into the garage doorjamb. Instead of having to remove that piece, 
isn't there some kind of putty I can use to fill it in? 
</P>
<P>
J.A., <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION> 
</P>
<P>
Answer: "If it's bad enough to look at, your best bet is to replace the jamb 
rather than try to fix it," says <PERSON>Jason Bartolone</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Ganahl Lumber</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Anaheim</LOCATION>. 
"The wood putty that you see in stores is mainly just for filling in small 
spaces and indoor use. The jamb is usually a 1-inch by 8-inch piece that can be 
cut to the height of the doorway. Removing the old jamb can get pretty messy 
because you're taking some of the stucco off with it. You'll have to use some 
stucco repair around the new jamb and paint to make it match the stucco around 
the house." 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have an old Oriental rug stored away that I would like to attach to the 
wall. What's the best way to hang it? 
</P>
<P>
L.T., <LOCATION>Laguna Beach</LOCATION> 
</P>
<P>
A: "How you hang your rug is going to depend first on the type of rug it is," 
says <PERSON>Arlene Spielman</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Villa Park Wall Boutique</ORGANIZATION>. "If it's silk, you can encase 
it between pieces of Lucite and frame it, which is an attractive way of hanging 
a delicate rug. If it's heavy, you may want to use a piece of 1x1-inch wood 
that's 2 inches shorter than the width of the rug. Staple the wood to the top 
back of the rug, then hang the wood on the wall. By centering the wood, you 
shouldn't see it when it's on the wall. You can also put one on the bottom to 
make it look even when it's hung." 
</P>
<P>
Q: The cut leaf maple tree in our back yard is about 30 years old and, while 
it's beautiful and thick in <DATE>summer</DATE>, it also keeps sunlight from getting to the 
lawn and flowers around it. I want to prune it myself; is there anything in 
particular I should know before doing it? 
</P>
<P>
A.K., <LOCATION>El Toro</LOCATION> 
</P>
<P>
A: "That's something you see a lot of in cut leaf maples," says <PERSON>Mike Inaba</PERSON> of 
<PERSON>Roger</PERSON>'s Gardens nursery in <ORGANIZATION>Corona del Mar.</ORGANIZATION> "They don't grow very tall, maybe 20 
feet at the most, but they grow out horizontally. What you want to do is make 
it look spread out, so your basic plan should be to thin some of the larger 
branches. Remember to make your cuts about 1 inch above the node, which is 
where the branches fork. There are also several good booklets available at 
garden stores specifically on pruning that might give you some insight into 
making it look good." 
</P>
<P>
Q: The tile on our kitchen counter is about 12 years old and it's in pretty 
good shape overall, except that in a few places there are some chips and nicks. 
No one seems to make this tile anymore, is there a way to fix the bad ones 
without replacing them? 
</P>
<P>
M.M., <LOCATION>Huntington Beach</LOCATION> 
</P>
<P>
A: "If you can't find the replacement tiles, you've got two choices," says <PERSON>Mark 
Handleman</PERSON>, a tile setter based in <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION>. "Try going to a place where they 
make ceramics and see if they have a glaze that would match your tiles. You can 
put the glaze on the chips, which isn't perfect but it's better than leaving 
them exposed. Or, if the bad tiles are in different areas around the counter, 
you can replace them with tiles of contrasting colors that can be done in some 
sort of pattern or just randomly, which a lot of people do now when installing 
tile." 
</P>
<P>
Q: Our fireplace brick was painted white by the home's previous owner and we'd 
like to remove it and keep it natural. Is there a sure way to get paint off 
masonry? 
</P>
<P>
V.T., La Habra 
</P>
<P>
A: "The problem with masonry is that it's very porous," says <PERSON>Bill Martin</PERSON>, a 
bricklayer in <LOCATION>Fullerton</LOCATION>. "You've got to take paint thinner and rags and rub out 
as much as you can. Then take more thinner and a wire brush and scrub the 
bricks until you get the paint of the pores. It's a long, dirty job, you just 
have to curse the people who painted them."

FADS; 
</P>
<P>
THEY'RE SILLY AND UNPREDICTABLE, AND CALIFORNIANS JUST CAN'T SEEM TO GET ENOUGH 
OF THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Fads were the subject: Will Batmania sweep <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> this <DATE>summer</DATE>? What will 
be the Hula Hoop of the '90s, the Pet Rock of the now generation? <PERSON>Ken Hakuta</PERSON>, 
a.k.a. "Dr. Fad," the man who sold 225 million Wacky Wallwalkers, pondered the 
question for the briefest moment. "In <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>," he said, "the word fad is 
kind of redundant." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Hakuta</PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> -- very comfortably, having made <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY> on 
his <DATE>1983</DATE> super-fad, an eight-legged rubber crawly that crept down the wall, is 
sure of one thing: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Strangeness in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> 
</P>
<P>
"People in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> are more used to acting silly than other people. In 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, you want to have the strangest thing, be doing the strangest thing. 
People admire that." 
</P>
<P>
It's not that most fads originate in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, he observed, but <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> is 
"the great incubator of fads. Fads get hot in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. A good idea can come 
from <LOCATION>Des Moines</LOCATION>, but it's not going to be anything there. Then it'll hit <LOCATION>Venice 
Beach</LOCATION> or Westwood and go all around the country, back to <LOCATION>Des Moines</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
Hot weather is prime fad weather, <PERSON>Hakuta</PERSON> observed -- "in warm weather, people 
are sillier" -- and this <DATE>summer</DATE>'s hottest fad just could be . . . 
</P>
<P>
The skateboard. 
</P>
<P>
The skateboard? "I think it's going to get really, really hot, it's going to 
become a really major league sport, with major prize money. And <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> is 
a mecca of skateboarding. It's a life-style sport. In a way, it's like a video 
game, back and forth, back and forth. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
But on the whole, said the author of "How to Create Your Own Fad and Make a 
Million Dollars": "I've been very bored with a lot of other things I see. To 
tell you the truth, we've gone through a big dry spell of fads." 
</P>
<P>
Grazing and channeling, baby-on-board and Garfield-in-the-window 
notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, concluded <PERSON>Hakuta</PERSON>, who hopes to shift his Fad Fair from the <LOCATION>East 
Coast</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> this <DATE>December</DATE>, "it's really pretty dull." 
</P>
<P>
It's not that the crazy, creative people aren't out there. It's just that their 
ideas aren't exactly the pogo sticks of tomorrow. Consider these, recently 
brought to "Dr. Fad," who dispenses free wisdom to would-be entrepreneurs of 
the ridiculous: 
</P>
<P>
A plaster of <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> sculpture called "The Hail <PERSON>Mary Pass</PERSON>," depicting the <PERSON>Virgin 
Mary</PERSON> throwing the last-ditch pass made famous by quarterback <PERSON>Doug Flutie</PERSON>. 
Celebrity dirt (spaded up from the yards of <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood</ORGANIZATION>'s rich and famous). 
Packaged <LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION> smog. Marbles, as in, "all your marbles." A glow-in-the-dark 
toilet seat. A stick in the mud. Diet shampoo, for people with big egos. And 
the "Dobermask," a Styrofoam mask to prop against your window or put on your 
cat so would-be intruders will think there's a Doberman on duty. 
</P>
<P>
What is a fad, and how does it start? 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Chaytor Mason</PERSON>, a psychologist who is associate professor of human factors at 
<ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, said: "The fad begins when we discover that there's a facet of our 
personality which has previously been unexpressed or unexpressable. The fad 
provides the means, or the excuse." Perfect examples, he said, are the vanity 
license plate and the bumper sticker. 
</P>
<P>
"Fads are all about fantasy. At propitious times in life, many of us feel the 
same way. Consequently, when somebody does something that fits our fantasies 
and needs, we suddenly find it very exciting." 
</P>
<P>
A classic, he observed, is blue jeans, which caught on in the '60s as a symbol 
of rebellion but proved to have a staying power rare to fads and, indeed, came 
to be a symbol of conformity. 
</P>
<P>
Fads, he believes, happen "pretty much by chance." Still, <ORGANIZATION>Mason</ORGANIZATION> sees one common 
denominator among super-fads: "Many have some sexual basis. Sex is very 
important." And so is price. Cheap is best. (<ORGANIZATION>Hakuta</ORGANIZATION>'s Wallwalker was a <MONEY>$2.50</MONEY> 
retail item.) 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, nostalgia fuels a fad. Mason mused about the current fad for leather 
bomber jackets and suggested that "there has not been a war for quite a spell . 
. . a war which was considered an acceptable adventure." Perhaps this fashion 
expression is a wish "to be part of something great, something dangerous," he 
said, to re-live the fervor of World War II, a real war. 
</P>
<P>
Californians' current preoccupation with health and fitness has resulted in a 
food fad, what <ORGANIZATION>Mason</ORGANIZATION> sees as a perverse preoccupation with food: If it tastes 
bad, or has virtually no taste at all, it must be good for you. He sees it as a 
reversion to the "puritanical idea that if it hurts, it must be godly. I think 
we've begun to feel guilty about enjoyable things." He noted that today "if you 
put 'light' on anything, probably including even water, you can sell it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trendy Words 
</P>
<P>
There are fads in language -- including the contemporary preoccupation with 
words such as prioritize and interface and network. And there are fads in 
names, in pets, in alcoholic beverages. (Whatever happened to that all-American 
drink, rye whiskey?) 
</P>
<P>
Pigs had their day, a fad spurred possibly by the appeal of the Muppets' Miss 
Piggy. Other fads we have known and loved include: happy faces, <ORGANIZATION>Volkswagen</ORGANIZATION> 
stuffing, panty raids, flagpole sitting, mood rings, Earth shoes, <LOCATION>Nehru</LOCATION> 
jackets, <LOCATION>E.T.</LOCATION>, Cabbage Patch Kids, Trivial Pursuit, <ORGANIZATION>Rubik</ORGANIZATION>'s Cube and Silly 
Putty. The late '70s brought us the tanning salon. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as we edge toward the '90s, <PERSON>Mason</PERSON> is predicting "a whiteness fad," given 
impetus by the skin cancer scare. At the same time, he said, black and other 
dark colors of clothing will be in vogue, as they contrast well with a pale 
skin, as will beauty marks, real or bogus. 
</P>
<P>
But then, a fad is, by definition, a passing fancy, usually non-utilitarian, a 
marketplace meteor that soon fizzles. As <PERSON>Hakuta</PERSON> puts it, "If you come up with 
something that's useless and promote it the right way, everybody will have to 
have it yesterday, even though they get up the next morning and wonder why they 
bought it." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Mason</PERSON> goes so far as to place in the fad category several items that are 
neither jokes nor useless. "Fax machines," he says, "I think that's a fad. And 
car telephones." Of the latter he says, "It's a prestige thing, the fantasy 
that I can contact the world, I am universal, I can contact <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> and 
tell him how to run the country. I look important if I'm sitting in traffic 
telephoning somebody." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Die of Own Weight' 
</P>
<P>
Have these items peaked? "I'd say probably a few more months and they will," he 
says. "They'll die of their own weight. People won't reorder, or they'll be 
lying around gathering dust." 
</P>
<P>
He's hedging his bets, though, on <LOCATION>Batmania</LOCATION>, even with all the hype for 
"Batman," which opened late last week in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. "I think the fad might 
not go too far . . . totally masculine, isolated things have a limited fad 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Most would-be fads die quietly. The common wisdom, says <PERSON>Melanie Wallendorf</PERSON>, 
associate professor of marketing at <ORGANIZATION>University of Arizona</ORGANIZATION> and co-author of 
"Consumer Behavior," is that <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> of new products fail. That figure is 
debatable, she says -- it could be high or low -- but it's safe to say that a 
huge number flop, "which means that even the most sophisticated people don't 
know what people will be fascinated with until it's in front of them. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of this is socially constructed. Children share with each other. 'Ah, 
<PERSON>Jimmy</PERSON> has a new Batman yo-yo,' then <PERSON>Sally</PERSON> wants one. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, with a new product, timing is all-important. Wallendorf observes 
that when <ORGANIZATION>Procter</ORGANIZATION> and Gamble first introduced paper diapers, "they were a flop. 
What sort of mother would put a paper diaper on her child, especially those 
mothers in the <DATE>1950s</DATE>?" 
</P>
<P>
In the <DATE>'60s</DATE>, the disposable diaper was reintroduced, this time to a group of 
young mothers starting to flex feminist muscle. To them, <PERSON>Wallendorf</PERSON> observes, 
"using cloth diapers meant you were more home-centered." That wasn't for them. 
The disposable took off. 
</P>
<P>
Economic times are not a predictable barometer of whether a fad will take hold. 
Said <PERSON>Wallendorf</PERSON>: "We could say, 'Well, it's only in good times people have 
money to spend on stuff like this.' Maybe it's in bad times people need a 
fantasy figure" -- like Batman. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Valerie Folkes</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> associate marketing professor, said: "If I could predict 
a fad, I wouldn't need this job. It's very hard to know what is going to 
capture the public's imagination." 
</P>
<P>
What is known, she says, is that word of mouth is the most effective marketing 
tool, together with media exposure. A fad, she said, "almost feeds on itself, 
like the Cabbage Patch doll fad. When people saw people standing in line, 
grabbing (dolls), this reinforced their idea that it was a good product." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Call Product 'New' 
</P>
<P>
One fair predictor of success for any new product is for it to have the word 
new attached to it. "A very powerful word," <PERSON>Folkes</PERSON> observes. "Americans value 
things that are new." 
</P>
<P>
The staying power of a fad often is related to the age group of its target 
market. Take adolescents, she said -- "ads blow through that group very quickly 
and die very quickly, sometimes greatly to the distress of the manufacturer." 
She mentioned the once-ubiquitous Frye boot. "The company geared up, made a lot 
of the product and suddenly adolescents decided they weren't interested in 
those boots anymore. . . . Sometimes companies don't like that their products 
are fads" as demand can disappear overnight. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of stores "really took a beating" on the <PERSON>Jennifer Beals</PERSON> "Flash Dance" 
look, ripped T-shirt and all, she said. "By the time they were able to stock 
that item, it was over with." 
</P>
<P>
Today's tie-dye could be tomorrow's puka shell necklace. 
</P>
<P>
"Fads are born to die," observes <PERSON>Hakuta</PERSON>. "In fad standard time, a day is a 
month, and a fad that lasts two months is a classic." 
</P>
<P>
But for those hoping to find the next Pet Rock, <PERSON>Tony Husch</PERSON> and <PERSON>Linda Foust</PERSON>, 
authors of "That's a Great Idea!," offer a few suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Think of a new automobile gadget. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Invent something specifically for commuters, to make those freeway hours 
more fun. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Think of a sensational name. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Forget about logic. They observe that, while most people like cola drinks 
and gelatin desserts, a cola-flavored gelatin didn't gel with consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"Consumers are unpredictable," they say. "What conventional market research 
principles could have predicted that millions of people would buy plastic tubes 
to swing around their hips or little stickers to paste on everything?" 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the creator of a new fad gets left at the starting gate. Remember 
those Baby on <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> signs, the brainchild of a Bostonian? "The guy who made all 
the money was the guy who made all those Mother-in-Law in <LOCATION>Trunk</LOCATION>, Ex-husband on 
Roof Rack signs," <PERSON>Hakuta</PERSON> said. "That was done in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
For some fadsters, it's just a matter of too little, too late. Hakuta is still 
scratching his head over the fellow from <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> who called his fad hotline 
(1-800-USA-FADS) with a terrific idea: blinking turn signals for cars. 
</P>
<P>
Hakuta himself is still searching for another Wacky Wallwalker. But he's 
philosophical, as well as rich. He said, "Most people who have had big fads 
have turned out to be just like their products, one-shot deals." 
</P>
<P>
For those thinking ahead -- way ahead -- <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mason</PERSON> is predicting: "If the 
Martians ever arrive on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, and if they are green, the first thing that's 
going to happen is women will have green makeup. Women are good identifiers. 
They identify with the new, the exciting, the adventurous. Eventually, the men 
would get around to it."

<TEXT>
   The magic tricks, dazzling and amazing, flow one
into the next. A mime troupe sparks children's laughter, while a
basketball game on unicycles draws chortles from adults.
   Walking through a green light that appears to have no ramp
beneath it, <PERSON>Siegfried</PERSON> and Roy opened the first of 32 performances at
<ORGANIZATION>Radio City Music Hall</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, a show as lavish in
constuming and lighting as those the late Liberace used to do.
   Siegfried and Roy are swallowed by two robots helped by
putty-colored people with big insect heads. A woman arrives, lifts
her arms and disappears. Another woman is seen swimming in a tank. A
cloth is thrown over the tank and when it's removed, a white tiger
is in there and the audience hears a tape-recorded roar.
   That all takes place in the first few minutes of the show, and
<PERSON>Siegfried</PERSON> and Roy aren't taking time to milk the applause. Their
show is so fast-paced the viewer has time only to gasp before the
next dazzlement.
   Women assistants suffer everything but being sawed in half. One
lies in a long box which is pushed together like an accordion.
Another swings on a swing from her waist up. Her skirt, legs and
feet dance out on stage separately. Another gets into a Japanese
box, which then is folded into a tiny square box. Unfolded into a
large rectangle again, she emerges from it. Another is balanced on a
spike, which seems then to skewer her.
   The charming <ORGANIZATION>Mummenschanz</ORGANIZATION> mime troupe from <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> was a
special favorite with children. A big green ``clam'' licks its lips
around a stuffed rabbit before gobbling it up. Two men wearing putty
masks made countless shapes with them, one pulling a pieces of the
``face'' out like chewing gum and whacking it back onto himself.
   The unicycle basketball teams are the <ORGANIZATION>King Charles Troupe</ORGANIZATION>, formed
in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> as a <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> unicycle club. There are a couple of Las
Vegas-style numbers by dancers wearing not much.
   The animals are beautiful. A white car drives on stage _ as
<ORGANIZATION>Liberace</ORGANIZATION> used to do _ bringing a mother white tiger and three cubs.
   Roy rides an elephant, which disappears, then reappears. At the
end, a 650-pound white tiger climbs atop a globe. With <PERSON>Roy</PERSON> on his
back, they're pulled into the air.
   It's a <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION> show and it's nonstop entertainment. New Yorkers
aren't too sophisticated for this.

   Redecorating with wallcoverings has become a popular
do-it-yourself project and manufacturers are encouraging the trend
by offering more coordinated patterns and borders in wallpaper
books.
   At the retail level, many shops offer guidance on how to hang
the covering and what types of adhesives to use.
   Retailers suggest you order all the wallcoverings you need at
the same time so they are all from the same color run.
   Before starting the job, check the lot numbers before unwrapping
the rolls and inspect the full length of each roll before you cut
it. If there are damaged rolls, return them.
   Consider what is on the walls in adjacent rooms before deciding
on color and pattern. You can choose a covering in a similar color,
with the same pattern scale or with the same ``feeling'' in mind,
such as a small floral pattern that coordinates with a larger,
bolder floral in the same colors.
   In general, light colors, textures and small overall prints are
unobtrusive, while large, splashy prints, shiny and metallic papers
dramatize space. To minimize bad walls, choose a low-gloss,
textured covering or a large overall print as long as it isn't
shiny.
   Small and dark rooms will seem more spacious if you choose pale
colors and small patterns.
   Lower a ceiling by covering it in a bright color or strong
pattern. Limit the use of a bold print by papering a foyer or hall
or small bath, since large, busy expanses of any pattern can become
tiresome.
   When it's time to apply the wallcovering, cover the pasting
table with plain brown wrapping paper or inexpensive tablecloths or
dropcloths. Don't use newspapers because the ink may come through
to the new covering.
   If you're working on top of old wallpaper, it's best to strip it
from the wall. Strippable or vinyl wallpaper peel off easily when
you grasp a corner and pull. Wash the walls with warm water and
scrape off the remaining glue with a putty knife after you've done
the stripping. If the wallpaper to be covered is in good, tight
condition, you can paper over it.
   At worst, rent a wallpaper steamer or apply wallpaper remover.
They soften the paper so you can scrape it off with a wide putty
knife. After scraping, wash the walls and allow them to dry before
hanging the new wallcovering.
   For a better-looking job, work slowly and don't try to finish
the projct in one day. Wallcovering paste dries slowly enough so
that you can adjust a strip and eliminate seam mismatches and
bubbles, if necessary.
   Save extra wallpaper, which can be used to fix small tears and
loose edges without repapering. For loose seams, apply the paste to
both the wall and the wallpaper, press the paper in place, smooth
it with a seam roller and then wipe away the extra paste.
   To patch a small damaged area, paste a new piece of wallcovering
larger than the tear over the damaged areas, matching the patterns
exactly. Allow the patch to set, but not to dry entirely. Then, cut
through both areas, clean the empty area and repaste the top piece.
Wait 15 minutes and roll the edges smooth.
   Other ways to use wallpaper:
   _ If there is a pattern, cut out some of the motifs and apply
them to lampshades and accessories.
   _ Wallpaper a closet.
   _ Create custom waste receptacles, perhaps from large round ice
cream cartons or plastic or metal wastepaper cans.
   _ Use wallpaper inserts on kitchen cabinets, bathroom counter
tops.
   _ Use for picture frames.
   _ Wallpaper borders can update and enliven old furniture. Just
glue them on.

THE ONE-HOUR PROJECT : AN OPEN-AND-SHUT CURE FOR STICKY WINDOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY ABRAMS, Abrams is a Santa Monica free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever go to open a window or sliding door and find that it is stuck so badly 
that you either cannot budge it at all or have to struggle with it inch by 
inch? Very frustrating to say the least, especially during hot <DATE>summer</DATE> weather. 
</P>
<P>
Before you call a carpenter or handyman, I have a few suggestions to help you 
"keep your cool" by keeping the most common windows and doors operating 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
If you are having trouble with wooden "double hung" windows, i.e. windows that 
lift up and down, you will probably find that there is a paint seal between the 
sash and the window frame. To break the seal, force a putty knife with 2-inch 
wide blade into the joint by tapping it lightly with a hammer. 
</P>
<P>
Work it all the way around the sash on the inside and outside. Once the window 
is free, try to open it manually. If it still sticks, go to the outside and 
insert the tip of a large flat blade screwdriver under either corner of the 
sash and gently pry it up. Be sure to alternate between the left and right side 
as you lift. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the window is unstuck, you may notice that it is still hard to 
operate. The best way I have found to correct this is to lubricate the tracks 
with ordinary Vaseline. 
</P>
<P>
First wipe off any dust or debris from the tracks and then dip a paper towel 
into the Vaseline. Lift the sash as high as possible and apply a light coat to 
the lower tracks. Close the window and repeat for the upper track. Finally, 
test the window three or four times. You should find a vast improvement right 
away. 
</P>
<P>
For sliding aluminum windows, doors or screens that stick or do not slide 
easily, you will need to clean and lubricate the track. With the window or door 
closed, use a broom or vacuum cleaner remove any debris from the exposed track, 
then open the window or door and repeat for the other side of the track. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, spray both sides of the track with a liberal amount of WD-40 spray 
lubricant (available at all hardware stores). All sliding window and door 
tracks should be cleaned and lubricated every other month to keep them running 
smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
French windows (windows that hinge like a "mini" door) are very prone to 
sticking becauses the wood expands and contracts with changes in the weather, 
causing the window frame to rub against the jamb. To correct this, look for 
contacts points (either lines or chafe marks on the paint) on the edge of the 
window frame. With a piece of coarse sandpaper, rub the contact points you find 
until you reach bare wood, then test the window for fit. 
</P>
<P>
If it still sticks, open it again and check for new contact points to sand. 
Repeat this procedure until all contact points have been removed and the window 
operates freely. (The above procedures also work on full-size doors that stick 
or rub the jamb). By the way, a good short-term remedy for windows or doors 
that rub the jamb lightly is to apply a thin coat of Vaseline to the contact 
point(s) as a lubricant. 
</P>
<P>
Casement windows are windows that hinge on the side and swing to the outside by 
means of a crank mechanism. When they stick, they can usually be fixed with a 
well-placed dose of WD-40 spray lubricant. Spray the track on the window, the 
hinges, and the crank mechanism itself. Operate the window a few times and 
spray again if its operation is still not smooth enough. 
</P>
<P>
If the window is wooden and rubs the jamb when closing, follow the procedures 
described above for French windows. If the window is made of metal, check if 
excess paint on the window frame is getting in the way. Remove any built-up 
paint with a knife or chisel.

ALICE KAHN: WHEN DID THEY MAKE THE BIG ELF A SAINT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICE KAHN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What awaits the weary shepherd following yonder fake star to the mall at 
Christmas? Relentless assaults by professional perfume sample squirters, 
guilt-tripping harangues by shrieking merchandise protesters and, now, the 
worst of all -- behavioral inquisitions from <LOCATION>Santa Claus</LOCATION>! 
</P>
<P>
I did not witness the incident myself. A friend took my daughter to the mall. 
That is because I am among the walking sane who avoid malls this time of year. 
I will go for city sidewalks, busy sidewalks or small neighborhood shops. But 
those walled cities of the damned bring out the caged rat in me. 
</P>
<P>
One pass through the brightly lit maze of Mrs. Fields', <ORGANIZATION>Calico Corners</ORGANIZATION>, 
Express, The Limited, <PERSON>Yogurt Delite</PERSON>, Tops 'n Bottoms, Big 'n Tall, Pretty 'n 
Plump, Closets 'n Things -- 'n I gotta bolt. 
</P>
<P>
This will probably be the last time my 11-year-old daughter sits on <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION>'s 
knee. By next year, the hormonal storm that's a comin' will no doubt take her 
away. So I asked her for a report on how it went. 
</P>
<P>
I expected to hear that when she sat down and he asked, "What do you want?" she 
handed him the same list of demands she brought to my holiday bargaining table. 
It reads like a litany of transitional dreams: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- A stereo with two tape places, a radio, two speakers, in a black, white, 
blue, gray or red color. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- Stuffed animals. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- Hair things. 
</P>
<P>
4 -- A phone in my room or my own line or get call waiting. 
</P>
<P>
5 -- A wallet. 
</P>
<P>
6 -- MONEY! 
</P>
<P>
7 -- Jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
8 -- A water bed. 
</P>
<P>
9 -- A new coat. 
</P>
<P>
10 -- More tapes. 
</P>
<P>
11 -- Candy -- an old-fashioned gumball machine. 
</P>
<P>
12 -- More dresses. 
</P>
<P>
13 -- Puffy Paints. 
</P>
<P>
14 -- Football. 
</P>
<P>
15 -- Soccerball. 
</P>
<P>
16 -- Socks. 
</P>
<P>
17 -- Headphones for my Walkman. 
</P>
<P>
18 -- Big stress guy. 
</P>
<P>
The last item was my favorite. It's a Silly Putty-like figure that you can 
squish and squeeze, sold under the name Executive Stress <PERSON>Buster</PERSON>. She already 
has a little one on her key chain, but no doubt the demands of the approaching 
12th birthday will require the stress guy in extra-Large. 
</P>
<P>
Just being a kid these days is stressful enough. And don't look to <LOCATION>Santa Claus</LOCATION> 
for a break. 
</P>
<P>
"So, did <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION> ask you if you'd been a good little girl?" I asked her. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION> has gotten more specific in these troubled times. "He 
asked me something else," she said. "He asked, 'What will you say when someone 
offers you drugs?' " 
</P>
<P>
She said he asked a lot of other questions. She was well coached and knew all 
the right answers. 
</P>
<P>
But I began to worry that instead of candy canes he was passing out condoms. 
</P>
<P>
I am certainly not opposed to drug education or sex education or even 
sensitivity training. There probably are children for whom <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION> is the only 
credible adult authority figure left. But I wonder if we can't let up for one 
minute and have a <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION> who is just a low-key, fun kinda guy. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I won't protest or sue or stage a write-in campaign against a 
sanctimonious <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION>, but you can bet some crusading mother-for-the-'90s will. 
And then, you know what will happen? We'll have to fill out permission forms to 
allow our child to sit on <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION>'s knee. 
</P>
<P>
Someday, some kid will be standing with a friend's mom at the mall, screaming 
and crying outside <LOCATION>Santaland</LOCATION> while the mall manager says, "I'm sorry, but we 
can't proceed unless we have the paperwork on this child." 
</P>
<P>
So, <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION>. Let's just keep it simple. Can you say: "Been a good little boy or 
girl? . . . Whatdaya want? . . . Here's a candy cane -- what's your hurry?" 
</P>
<P>
The last thing the mall needs is a <LOCATION>Santa Claus</LOCATION> who's acting like some kind of 
saint.

HANDYMAN Q&amp;A: HOME IMPROVEMENT; 
</P>
<P>
DON'T GET TIED UP ON REMOVING SASH CORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDY LANG, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: One of the double-hung windows in our house has gone haywire. I am 
fairly certain the trouble is with the sash cord. Can the cord be removed or is 
it too much of a job? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Removing the sash is not difficult. Merely take off the stop moldings 
on the inside. Use a chisel or putty knife and work very carefully, especially 
if you intend to use the moldings again. If your aim is to replace the sash 
cord with another of the same type, be sure to observe how the cord is 
connected so you will be able to replace it without too much trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Before you do this, however, look into the kinds of sash cords now on the 
market. They are easier to use and install and are virtually indestructible. 
</P>
<P>
Can <ORGANIZATION>Plywood Be Nailed Directly</ORGANIZATION> to Studs? 
</P>
<P>
Q: When paneling an extra room with plywood, I can save a lot of time by 
nailing the plywood directly to the studding. But I read somewhere that it is 
much better to nail the panels to furring strips that have been attached to the 
studs. This seems like extra work. Is it necessary or can I go ahead and nail 
to the studs? 
</P>
<P>
A: You can nail the plywood right to the studs, but then you risk the studs 
warping or shrinking later on and causing the wall to be uneven. The furring 
strips minimize the possibility of this taking place. In still another method, 
you put up a drywall and then attach the plywood to it. In any case, no matter 
which method of installation you use, buy the plywood ahead of time so it can 
be kept in the room several days before application. This will give it time to 
acclimate. 
</P>
<P>
Powdered Pumice: Where to Buy It 
</P>
<P>
Q: You recently told someone about using powdered pumice to smooth the surface 
of a piece of furniture that had just been finished. I was unable to get it in 
my local hardware store, which referred me to the local pharmacy. Sure enough, 
the drug store carried it. Thought your readers would like to know. 
</P>
<P>
A: Thanks. While most hardware stores and home center dealers carry the 
powdered pumice, so do some drug stores and some art supply establishments. 
</P>
<P>
Sawing Metal Takes Different Strokes 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have cut a lot of wood, but I have never used a hacksaw. This time I have 
to cut some metal. Is there any trick to it or do I just saw the same way as 
with a crosscut saw? 
</P>
<P>
A: Forget about the way you cut wood. With a hacksaw, you do not apply pressure 
on the backstroke. The hacksaw must be held as flat as possible for an even 
cut. Put the pressure on the forward stroke, release the pressure on the back 
stroke. When possible, keep both hands on the hacksaw frame. Start the cut with 
several short foward strokes. When putting the blade in the frame, the teeth 
should slant forward. 
</P>
<P>
Should Molding on Plywood Be Glued? 
</P>
<P>
Q: To cover the edges of plywood, I plan on attaching molding to them. Should I 
use glue or nails or what? 
</P>
<P>
A: Use glue and then a couple of well-placed nails. Depending on the kind of 
project you are working on, the finishing nails can be driven a bit below the 
surface and the indentations filled with wood putty or other filler. 
</P>
<P>
Patches Available for Hiding Holes in Wall 
</P>
<P>
Q: The wallboard in our living room needs patching. I can handle most of the 
job, but I'm not sure how to go about filling the few spots where there are 
openings in the wall without anything behind them. Can I apply masking tape 
over each opening and then cover with a patching compound? 
</P>

patch available in most paint stores and home centers. Tape it on according to 
the directions and you will find it easy to disguise the patch when it is 
painted.

MAKEUP ARTIST MAURICE SEIDERMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
<PERSON>Maurice Seiderman</PERSON>, an inventor, sculptor and makeup artist whose elaborate 
masks and skin putty were used to age <LOCATION>Orson Welles</LOCATION> and his co-stars several 
decades in the course of the film "Citizen <PERSON>Kane</PERSON>," has died in <LOCATION>Port Angeles</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Wash</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
His brother, <PERSON>Nathan</PERSON>, said he died <DATE>July 17</DATE> at age 81 after a series of heart 
ailments. 
</P>
<P>
Born in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, Seiderman studied art in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> before joining RKO 
Studios as a junior member of the makeup department in the <DATE>1930s</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Confronted with the problem of aging the characters in "Citizen Kane" as much 
as 50 years, he made a series of plaster casts of the principal actors and 
sculpted pieces of molded plastic foam for each in which their features 
gradually sagged and their hair thinned. 
</P>
<P>
He also was an inventor who researched the use of contact lenses and held 
several patents in that field. It was his skill there that produced the aging 
eyes of the actors. 
</P>
<P>
"Citizen Kane" was not Seiderman's only challenge; he also produced the 
disfigured faces in "Enchanted Cottage," the makeup and wigs in "Gunga Din" and 
"The Hunchback of Notre Dame" and worked on such Welles classic films as "The 
Magnificent Ambersons" and "Macbeth." 
</P>
<P>
He made <PERSON>Raymond Massey</PERSON> into "Abe Lincoln in <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>" and <PERSON>Judith Anderson</PERSON> into 
"Lady Scarface." 
</P>
<P>
Seiderman also was a versatile inventor and businessman, his brother said. He 
pursued business enterprises ranging from doll manufacturing to research for 
the Waring blender. 
</P>
<P>
Late in his life, he became an artist, painting abstracts on slides under a 
microscope he designed himself. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his brother, he is survived by his wife, <PERSON>Celita</PERSON>.

the paint remover with a tent made from aluminum foil and place something
nearby to shade the area from direct sunlight. Remove the paint with water and
a stiff, natural-bristle brush. It may take a couple of applications, but you
should have good results.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Better Mail Than Jail . . .;     I READ your article about suggestions to
improve the Giants. Well, here's my 2 cents' worth: Get a new manager and
pitching coach. Get rid of the old pitchers. Start up the "Humm Baby" campaign
again. The Giants seemed to do well with that slogan.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  NO SHORTAGE OF SUGGESTIONS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>  <PERSON>T. Mallory</PERSON>, <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>;    But the manager invented the slogan. How can you fire
one and keep the other? The problem is hitting, not pitching. Last <DATE>Friday</DATE> when
<PERSON>Mike LaCoss</PERSON> lost 3-0, why didn't anyone get upset that the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> scored no
runs?;    THANKS FOR your refreshing column on <PERSON>Don Nelson</PERSON>. I had come to think
there was some hidden tenet making it sacrosanct for the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION> sports media
to do anything but praise "Nellie the Genius." He should examine how <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>'s
<PERSON>Chuck Daly</PERSON> transformed the Pistons into a two-time <ORGANIZATION>NBA</ORGANIZATION> champion by making
astute low-level draft picks (<ORGANIZATION>Dumars</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Rodman</PERSON>, <PERSON>Salley</PERSON>), motivating "over the
hill" talent (<ORGANIZATION>Edwards</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Aguirre</PERSON>, <PERSON>Laimbeer</PERSON>) and avoiding excuses.; <PERSON>Geoffrey
Baker</PERSON>, <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>;    Hold on. Nelson doesn't make excuses. He just doesn't make
it past the second or third round.;    WHO CARES about <PERSON>Rickey Henderson</PERSON>? The
guy is a Class A jerk. I am so tired of reading about him and <PERSON>Jose Canseco</PERSON>
that I am ceasing to watch the news or read the <ORGANIZATION>Mercury News</ORGANIZATION> sports section. I
wonder how many other people in the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION> feel this way?; <PERSON>Barry Russell</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>;    I don't know, but let's take a survey: All people who aren't
reading this sports section, please raise your hands.;    I DON'T think you
gave much thought to your column about the 49ers' draft picks. The <DATE>1991</DATE>
football season has yet to begin, and already you have counted out the 49ers'
first pick, calling Ted <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> "iffy" and mediocre. If you don't have
anything nice to say, don't say anything at all. (Mark: Please disregard the
preceding words. I'm a loyal reader, but was forced to write a letter arguing
an issue for a class. Your column was all I could find.);    <PERSON>Brian Hunter</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Los
Altos</LOCATION>;    Let's see if I have this straight: You were forced to insult me,
after receiving academic credit for reading my column. No wonder our
educational system is in trouble.;    I THINK you've blown the <PERSON>Ronnie Lott</PERSON>
story. Ronnie has been an outstanding player, but he openly criticized 49ers
management. I recall his salary holdout a few years back, which the team's
management handled with class. Ronnie has a large ego that requires regular
feeding, and let's face it -- the bottom line is, he sold out to scummy <PERSON>Al
Davis</PERSON> for an extra <MONEY>$200,000</MONEY>.; <PERSON>Don Warfield</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Los Gatos</LOCATION>;    I don't think it was
<MONEY>$200,000</MONEY>. I think it was what the <MONEY>$200,000</MONEY> represented.;    A GUY I work with
insists that in <PERSON>Nolan Ryan</PERSON>'s attic there is a decaying painting of some old
guy in a baseball uniform.; <PERSON>Gary Moore</PERSON>, <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>;    Maybe. And whoever the
old guy in the painting is, the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> will sign him by July.;    I USUALLY
enjoy your work. However, I did not enjoy your column asking people to pick
<PERSON>Jose Canseco</PERSON>'s next date. If it was that slow a news day, you should have
simply left the front page of the sports section blank.; <PERSON>Dorothy Bence</PERSON>, <LOCATION>San
Jose</LOCATION>;    Funny. That's what <ORGANIZATION>Madonna</ORGANIZATION> said, too.;    DO YOU always write fairy
tales?;    <PERSON>John Koehne</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Milpitas</LOCATION>;    But . . .;    Q: WHAT'S the difference
between a well-written column by <PERSON>Mark Purdy</PERSON>, and Bigfoot? A: There have been
reported sightings of Bigfoot.; <PERSON>Bob Holden</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Concord</LOCATION>;    But . . .;    I DON'T
care what my brother says. You're the greatest thing since Silly Putty.; <PERSON>Dave
Holden</PERSON>, <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>;    Wait a minute. Is this one of those "evil twin" ploys?  </TEXT>

JUST YOUR BASIC CUBAN-FRENCH-VIET FARE

<TEXT>
<P>
Places <LOCATION>Afar</LOCATION> is your basic Cuban-French-Vietnamese restaurant set in a shopping 
mall. Two chefs are in charge of the kitchen -- one is Cuban, the other 
Vietnamese. If you are wondering about the connection, I have a good 
explanation. The chefs are married. 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese dishes here are as good as you'll find in <LOCATION>Little Saigon</LOCATION>. 
Imperial salad is a bowlful of cold, rice noodles and leafy greens with 
vinegared carrot, crushed peanut, barbecued pork and shrimp, plus Vietnamese 
egg rolls (crisper and more densely filled than in the rest of <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>). 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant's five-spice chicken, a large plate of sauteed chicken and 
winter vegetables, is made with a pungent spice mixture that permeates every 
bite. You can also get Vietnamese fried rice, beef with mint and chili, and bun 
bo (beef noodle soup). 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the Cuban dishes -- wonderful ham croquettes, for instance, 
which are crispy, deviled cylinders served with greaseless fried plantain chips 
and perfect roulades of smoky ham and Emmentaler cheese. Even smokier is the 
puree of green peas in hot soup form with chicharrones crumbled on top. 
</P>
<P>
Of the Cuban entrees, I sampled the picadillo and the pan de bistec. I can 
recommend both. Picadillo is ground beef served over rice with plenty of 
onions, garlic and raisins in a highly seasoned tomato stock. It's like a 
sophisticated Sloppy <PERSON>Joe</PERSON>. Pan de bistec (available only at lunch) is thinly 
sliced brisket on a soft roll with a large heap of grilled onions. 
</P>
<P>
If you come at night, you can choose from a French menu that includes 
choucroute garni and couscous <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION> with orange chili oil. Desserts 
like cascas, guava paste over white cheese, and a good rice pudding and flan 
are always available. 
</P>
<P>
Places <LOCATION>Afar</LOCATION> is inexpensive. Lunch items range from <MONEY>$2.95</MONEY> to <MONEY>$5.95</MONEY>. Dinners are 
from <MONEY>$5.95</MONEY> to <MONEY>$13.95</MONEY>.

As the carriage wheel in the parking lot indicates, a calesa is a horse-drawn 
carriage used in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>. But Calesa, the restaurant, is a richly 
luxurious place that wouldn't look out of place in any first-class hotel in the 
Philippine capital. 
</P>
<P>
Magnificent lanterns made from a Filipino shell called capiz are suspended over 
cloth-draped tables and ornate stainless steel carvings are placed throughout 
the dining room. Waiters wear tuxedoes and flame things at tables with great 
pomp and ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
The motto here is "Around the World Dining," and indeed the menu is defiantly 
eclectic here. Everything from paella to Indonesian sate to pure 
Continental-style desserts (e.g., baked <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>) shows up on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best dishes here is an appetizer called gambas al ajillo, a remnant 
Filipino favorite from colonial days. It's a sizzling casserole of golden brown 
shrimp with lots of minced garlic and crusty, oil-rubbed bread. The <LOCATION>Shanghai</LOCATION> 
fried lumpia are good shrimp and pork egg rolls, unfortunately served with a 
forgettable sweet red sauce that is supposed to be sour. 
</P>
<P>
Chicken tara -- grilled cutlets with sticky pineapple and mango chutneys on the 
side -- sounds intriguing, but is so sweet I thought the waiters would come by 
any minute and flame it for dessert. Better is caldereta, a spicy beef 
preparation from the little known Philippine province of <LOCATION>Pampanga</LOCATION>. It's a dish 
that doesn't seem Asian at all -- the beef is covered with a thick blanket of 
sauce made from duck liver paste. I pegged it as a French-Yiddish-Hungarian 
concoction, but the chef assured me it was purely Pampangan. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> crab cakes with a Mornay sauce on the side aren't bad at all. But 
lengua estofado -- sliced ox tongue in a red wine sauce with mushrooms and 
olives -- was a big disappointment. It was somewhat salty and hockey-puck 
tough. 
</P>
<P>
All the old-time hotel desserts are served at Calesa: crepe suzette, baked 
<LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, flaming fruit jubilee. You can also get a Filipino meringue confection 
with several layers of butter cream that taste sort of like silly putty. 
</P>
<P>
Calesa is moderately expensive. Appetizers are <MONEY>$5</MONEY> to <MONEY>$6.50</MONEY>. Filipino dishes are 
<MONEY>$12</MONEY> to <MONEY>$16</MONEY>. House specialties are <MONEY>$12</MONEY> to <MONEY>$18</MONEY>. The paellas (for two only) are

   Termites taste like fish, palm grubs
resemble pork sausages, and ants can remind one of goose-liver
pate, says anthropologist <PERSON>Darna Dufour</PERSON>.
   Sound tasty? Well, <PERSON>Dufour</PERSON> says, ``in the jungle, insects are
good to eat.''
   That was the theme of her lecture on insect cuisine <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> at
the <ORGANIZATION>University of Colorado Museum</ORGANIZATION>. It was a prelude to the museum's
``Bug Day Afternoon'' <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, when children and adventurous
adults will scour fields for large grasshoppers _ not to eat but to
enter in the ``Big Hopper'' competition.
   Dufour dined on such delicacies as ants, termites, beetles and
caterpillars during a 16-month study of the eating habits of the
Tukanoan Indians of eastern <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>.
   In her research along the Colombian-Brazilian border, <PERSON>Dufour</PERSON>
found that the Tukanoans consumed insects as a food supplement and
sometimes as a sole source of nourishment when fish weren't
available.
   Natives preferred to harvest some of the insects, particularly
termites and ants, in larvae stages ``when they're highest in fat
and protein content,'' she said. Sometimes, insects like ants are
used as a spread for bread and the ants resembled ``bacon bit sort
of things,'' she said.
   Although some caterpillars are saved, most of the insects
collected are eaten rapidly. ``It's a hand-to-mouth situation with
insects,'' she said.
   <PERSON>Dufour</PERSON> said that after overcoming some initial queasiness, she
learned to like some insects.
   While westerners are repulsed about consuming caterpillars, she
added, the Tukanoans don't particularly like some foods, either.
   Milk ``makes them want to vomit,'' she said. And eggs and
chicken are out, because chickens are seen as scavengers.

<HEAD>French Army Parades Chic New Uniforms</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the fashionable French trench, tacky khaki is out
and polyester is in.
   The berets can stay but unpleated pants got their marching orders
as the army paraded its new uniforms <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> at an unusual fashion
show.
   Not everyone was wild about the styles; some full-figured
soldiers complain they may have to wear girdles to squeeze into the
new skirt-pants for women.
   The parade showed blousons for all enlisted persons and straight,
pleated pants for men and women. The lighter fabrics and colors with
contemporary style and practicality make army gear look made more
for fashion than fighting.
   ``It was time for a change,'' said Gen. <PERSON>Gilbert Forray</PERSON>, chief of
staff of the army, who helped engineer the creation of the uniforms,
which had not changed for 40 years. The uniforms were ordered from
the house of <LOCATION>Balmain</LOCATION>.
   Balmain, who also recently redesigned uniforms for the French
police, was chosen after polls conducted within the army to
determine which cuts, colors and fabrics would best suit the needs
of today's army.
   The clothes were designed by <ORGANIZATION>Balmain</ORGANIZATION>'s couture designer <PERSON>Erik
Mortensen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Patrick Aubert</PERSON>, head of the company's masculine
fashion department.
   The fashion parade, after opening with some flamboyant
red-white-blue braid-edged redingotes from the time of <LOCATION>Louis</LOCATION> XV,
displayed what the new officers, gentlemen and women will wear in
the service beginning in <DATE>1991</DATE>.
   The new blousons with a shoulder-to-waist pleat are both sober
and chic. The clothes are topped with kepis for officers or sharp
berets with wheel-shaped pins.
   ``And thank heaven they didn't get rid of the kepi,'' said one
male fashion observer, who noticed that male officers would still
sport the hat silhouette as distinctive as <ORGANIZATION>Charles de Gaulle's</ORGANIZATION>.
   Khaki is out in the new military palette, a lighter shade of
putty or pewter called ``terre de <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'' is in, and in a lighter
fabric _ a mix of wool and polyester, rather than heavy twill.
   ``It's more practical, a lot less gear is involved now, and it's
more elegant,'' said Capt. <PERSON>Denis Brunel</PERSON>.
   Except for navy blue uniforms for the infantry, the army will
wear the new greige, and women will no longer wear their slate blue,
but the same putty color as men.
   ``That's good, and makes women more the equal of men,'' said Sgt.
<PERSON>Patrick Gall</PERSON>. ``My wife is in the army too, she'll surely approve.''
   A layered look called ``modular'' means officers and gentlemen
can go without their coats even when confronting superiors. The
light cotton poplin shirts underneath have epaulets, tab pockets and
may be substituted for a jacket in warm weather.
   ``I think the uniforms look very good and easy to wear,'' said
Col. <PERSON>Abraham Vigilant</PERSON> of the artillery corps. ``They give an
impression of serenity, which we need in the army. I'm a philosopher
_ with my feet on the ground.''
   The only sticky problem, so to speak, is in women's skirt-pants,
a new knee-length pair of bermuda shorts with a wrapped skirt
covering.
   ``What about real women? I'm waiting to see how the new uniforms
will work out on us,'' said Sgt. <PERSON>Chantal Grosjean</PERSON>, a full-figured
soldier about 5-foot-4. ``A real woman has thighs and a stomach.
What happens with these uniforms? We might have to wear girdles.''
   And she also thought they might prove difficult in <DATE>summer</DATE>. ``We
have to sit around on those fake leather chairs all day long.''

The animals were in the house at <LOCATION>Club Lingerie</LOCATION>, as two leaders from the latest 
fraternity of college-level goofball bands played their neo-toga rock. 
</P>
<P>
Double D Nose might perceive itself as a shotgun wedding between <ORGANIZATION>Metallica</ORGANIZATION>, 
<PERSON>James Brown</PERSON> and the Beastie Boys, but it's more like the <ORGANIZATION>Blues Brothers</ORGANIZATION> from 
Hell. Talk about your unlikely frontmen: 90-pound weakling <PERSON>Daniel Weizman</PERSON> 
(a.k.a local underground rock critic Shredder) snarled and screamed and grabbed 
his crotch, playing the hyperactive foil to <PERSON>Josh Schreiber</PERSON> (son of comedian 
<PERSON>Avery Schreiber</PERSON>), a Yeti-like apparition in bad platforms and old Cheap Trick 
tour jacket. 
</P>
<P>
Pledging allegiance to their special brand of funk and rapping about the 
pleasures of preschool <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, this bizarre duo managed to get by on 
sheer panache and the vise-tight backing of a seven-piece band complete with 
snappy horn section, bodacious female singers and a trio of long-haired rock 
dudes. Double D Nose is an animated cartoon, more silly putty than def jam, and 
a perverse assault on preconceived notions of how rock/rap/funk performers are 
supposed to be. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Dread Zeppelin</ORGANIZATION> manages to milk a whole set out of a single concept: a bad fat 
Elvis imitator fronting a band playing reggae versions of <ORGANIZATION>Led Zeppelin</ORGANIZATION> songs. 
It's initially a big hoot that becomes numbingly predictable -- you just know 
this group will do "Stairway to Heaven" for an encore. And they do. All that 
was missing was <PERSON>Jaye P. Morgan</PERSON> striking the gong. The sextet has already 
developed a rabid following, though, which is more culturally ironic than 
anything in <LOCATION>Dread Zeppelin</LOCATION>'s one-joke pastiche.CRAIG LEE

   MINA SAUD, Kuwait -- When Charles Hall approached a woman
at a Louisiana bar last year, he reckoned he had an original
opening line.
   "I told her, `I blow up bombs for a living,'" he recalls.
"She smiled and said, `Well I'm a mortician, so I'll probably
be seeing you again.'"
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A few months later, they married in the chapel at the
funeral parlor where she works. Soon afterward, <PERSON>Mr. Hall</PERSON>
headed to <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> to blow up Iraqi mines and allied munitions
littering the desert sand.
   "You've got to have a bit of a death wish to do this job,"
he says, molding a lump of plastic explosive and laying it
beside a live cluster bomb. A co-worker sets a charge, then
uncoils fuze line as the two men backpedal 200 yards. Soon
the desert shudders as the bomb explodes in a plume of black
smoke and white sand.
   <PERSON>Mr. Hall</PERSON> smiles contentedly. "I was into fireworks as a
kid," he says.
   Now that firefighters have quenched <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>'s burning oil
wells, there is no debate about who has the riskiest job in
this emirate. Six men died putting out fires. Bomb demolition
-- known also as explosive ordnance demolition, or <ORGANIZATION>EOD</ORGANIZATION> -- has
killed 50 so far, and wounded dozens of the hundreds still
working here.
   Even the firefighters, flamboyant cowboys not famed for
their modesty, regard <ORGANIZATION>EOD</ORGANIZATION> workers with awe. <PERSON>Butch Feaster</PERSON>, an
Oklahoman with scarred arms the size of tree trunks, saw
several men killed while clearing mines for his firefighting
team. "These guys dance through those mine fields in shorts
and thongs as if they're out picking daisies," <PERSON>Mr. Feaster</PERSON>
says.
   If peril comes with the turf, so too does a sick sense of
humor. At a barbecue, <ORGANIZATION>EOD</ORGANIZATION> workers joke about a novice who
stepped on a mine and was thrown into the air and killed. "He
followed a steep learning curve," quips one man. Another
reports a fatal accident involving a faulty grenade, and
says, "You only need one of those to spoil your day."
   World-wide, the bomb-disposal business is booming for the
dozen or so private <ORGANIZATION>EOD</ORGANIZATION> companies. The <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> is
hiring teams to clear war-torn nations, such as <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>,
which lack funds to do it themselves. The Cold War's thaw
means that many weapons stockpiles may be slated for
demolition. And fresh conflicts in <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Somalia</LOCATION> and
parts of the former <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> promise to bolster <ORGANIZATION>EOD</ORGANIZATION>
demand for years.
   "Every time I pick up the paper and read about a new civil
war, I think `Great, as soon as it's over, I'll be there,'"
says <PERSON>Richard Lowther</PERSON>, a marine <ORGANIZATION>EOD</ORGANIZATION> expert who has spent lean
years blowing up some of the thousands of sea mines left over
from World Wars I and II.
   Kuwait alone may be a three-year, <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> bonanza. The
Iraqis laid more than 500,000 mines, and abandoned tons of
explosives. But allied munitions pose the greatest threat.
Fully a third of the 100,000 or so tons dropped by the allies
never exploded, in part owing to soggy sand, but also because
the arsenal included stockpiled or experimental weapons with
a high dud ratio.
   "Some of this new stuff looks as if it landed from another
planet," says <PERSON>Brian Ashwell</PERSON>, operations manager for <ORGANIZATION>Passive
Barriers</ORGANIZATION>, a British <ORGANIZATION>EOD</ORGANIZATION> company. His office in <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>
resembles the workshop where the weapons whiz "Q" equips 007
in James Bond films. Shelves and floors are stuffed with the
latest in the killing science, most of it made in the <LOCATION>U.S.A.</LOCATION>:
"rockeye" anti-armor bomblets (finned explosives which
scatter, 400 at a time, from bursting bombs), BLU 63
submunitions (olive drab balls that split open, spewing
shrapnel), and V69 anti-personnel mines (spiked cones that
shoot out trip wires and jump to waist height before
exploding).
   Polaroid snapshots of newfangled weapons, such as a
parachute-delivered mine that doubles as a listening device,
line the walls. The firm photographs weapons it doesn't
recognize and asks the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military to provide it with a
"footprint," or signature, so <ORGANIZATION>EOD</ORGANIZATION> workers can safely dispose
of them. Standing in one corner of the office is a medical
dummy clad in chain mail. Passive Barriers also designs
protective gear, and it has found <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> a good place to test
its products.
   "That dummy took a grenade at five yards," <PERSON>Mr. Ashwell</PERSON>
says proudly. "Barely a scratch."
   British <ORGANIZATION>EOD</ORGANIZATION> workers are prospering here, trading on their
recent field experience in the <LOCATION>Falklands</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Northern Ireland</LOCATION>
(some <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies offer a different sort of expertise:
They help manufacture the high-tech weaponry they are now
being hired to pick up). There also are <ORGANIZATION>EOD</ORGANIZATION> workers from
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Bangladesh</LOCATION>. Passive Barriers'
employees typify this tight-knit, secretive industry: Most
are former military divers or commandos with tattoos on their
biceps and combat missions they can't discuss.
   "People who do this are thrill seekers," says <PERSON>Mr. Hall</PERSON>,
the lone American among Passive Barriers' 20-man crew. "They
drive fast, work hard, play hard."
   <PERSON>Mr. Hall</PERSON> fits the profile. As a child in <LOCATION>Fredericksburg</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, he combed Civil War battlefields with metal detectors,
searching for miniballs. He rode motorcycles. In the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> he
signed up for atomic weapons demolition, and served on the
<ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> bomb squad.
   Now, at 30, <PERSON>Mr. Hall</PERSON> is earning <MONEY>$1,500</MONEY> a week -- about
half the wage of oil firefighters -- risking his life in the
desert. "Just in case," he says, leading the way through a
dangerous patch, "put your feet exactly where I have." The
mine fields, which Iraqis originally planted on the surface
and bordered with wooden or wire markers, now have been
partly obscured by windblown sand.
   In essence <ORGANIZATION>EOD</ORGANIZATION> workers act as detectives, reconstructing
the scene of battle. Approaching a bombed-out Iraqi radar
station, <PERSON>Mr. Hall</PERSON> and his colleagues case the site, studying
craters and shrapnel to determine the path and dispersal of
incoming fire. Then they methodically locate each unexploded
piece, and "send it to the moon" -- <ORGANIZATION>EOD</ORGANIZATION> lingo for blowing it
up.
   "Your biggest enemy is your own ego," <PERSON>Mr. Hall</PERSON> says,
sweeping a beach with a high-powered metal detector. "You
have to resist getting complacent and saying, `There's
nothing out there I can't handle.'" To avoid losing
concentration, <ORGANIZATION>EOD</ORGANIZATION> workers trade off the metal detector about
every 20 minutes.
   <ORGANIZATION>EOD</ORGANIZATION> workers also stumble on grisly reminders of war:
decomposing limbs, charred bones and the mass graves of Iraqi
soldiers, usually marked with a single truck tire.
   "We're the shock troops," <PERSON>Mr. Hall</PERSON> says, eyes peeled to an
unswept stretch of <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>'s desert, still rife with
explosives. Last <DATE>spring</DATE>, working for another firm, he saw a
co-worker lose a hand. Passive Barriers has had one casualty:
a man "fragged" while taking the detonator out of a mine. He
is now back on the job, with shrapnel still in his back.
   Other teams haven't been so lucky. <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>'s entire
five-man crew was killed or maimed in two accidents. An
additional 1,250 civilians have been killed or wounded, as
have hundreds of camels and sheep.
   But <ORGANIZATION>EOD</ORGANIZATION> workers deflect the dangers of their trade with
armor-plated machismo. Few wear protective gear, which
restricts movement and also isn't likely to guard against
potent explosives. "I'd rather die than have my arms and legs
blown off," <PERSON>Mr. Hall</PERSON> explains.
   In one respect, though, the American differs from his
middle-aged, British colleagues. He plans to work in <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>
just long enough "to make a nest egg and go live a normal
life" with his mortician wife in <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>. He isn't sure yet
what his next career will be, but he suspects it won't be
bomb disposal.
   "I like it for the kicks and the money," he says, kneading
a ball of plastic explosives as if it were Silly Putty. "But
I don't want to walk on the wild side forever."

INTERIORS: THE MAGIC OF A HOME WITH WOODEN FLOORS; 
</P>
<P>
INTERIORS: THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CHOICES IN THE TYPE OF WOODS AVAILABLE WHEN 
INSTALLING FLOORS, MANY OF THEM ARE PREFINISHED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS GIBSON, Gibson is a Malibu free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Each year, manufacturers introduce new, improved types of man-made flooring, 
all perfectly uniform. But wood remains a universal favorite for its durability 
and the timeless, matchless charm of its natural irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
A tree trunk is ringed because the large, soft cells of its rapid springtime 
growth contrast with the dark, dense cells of its slower summer growth. 
Cellular structure determines the density, direction, color and pattern of each 
tree's grain. 
</P>
<P>
Today, most flooring is made from logs cheaply slash-cut with circular band 
saws. A century ago, more flooring was sawed at an angle. This costlier method 
produces elaborately patterned edge-grain on two faces, revealing the full 
beauty of the wood. 
</P>
<P>
Because moisture makes it swell and warp, raw lumber must be dried in an 
artificially heated kiln that evaporates three-fourths of the wood's sap and 
cellular fluid. Another <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> is forced from cell walls, shrinking boards across 
the grain to create hard, strong, light flooring. 
</P>
<P>
Such softwoods as pine, fir and redwood are often used for Colonial or rustic 
plank floors with beveled edge to simulate cracks and walnut plugs to simulate 
antique pegs. Budget-minded remodelers sometimes floor older homes with 
1-by-6-inch tongued-and-grooved pine roofing boards secured by quaint, 
old-fashioned, oblong-headed cut nails. 
</P>
<P>
However, as softwoods are less wear-resistant because their cells are less 
dense, hardwood strips far outsell them. In greatest demand are 3/4-by-2 
1/4-inch oak strips of random length, installed at zigzag intervals or in a 
herringbone pattern. For snug fit, each strip is milled with a projecting 
tongue on one side and a groove on the other. Nails driven through tongues are 
hidden by grooves. 
</P>
<P>
Experts differ as to whether ends should be tongued-and-grooved. Some contend 
that square-edged strips with interlocking sides lie just as flat. Others 
insist they squeak. According to <PERSON>Jim Martin</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Malibu Lumber</ORGANIZATION>, "the tighter the 
fit, the stronger the floor." 
</P>
<P>
Square-edged strips require face-nailing and "may throw off stability," warns 
<PERSON>Jeff Brotman</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Virginia Hardwood</LOCATION>, "because boards want to move as much as they 
can." 
</P>
<P>
Parquet flooring is another popular wood floor. Block parquets are solid, 
unfinished, tongued-and-grooved squares composed of hardwood pieces splined 
together to form a decorative mosaic. 
</P>
<P>
Oak is, again, the most popular wood, 12-by-12-inch the most popular size, 
alternating cross-matched strips the most popular pattern. However, blocks from 
4-by-4 inches to 4-by-4 feet are made in a dazzling array of tones and woods, 
forming intricate patterns copied from palaces throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
Laminated parquets are cheaper squares of thin board, bonded together like 
plywood, sold by floor-covering dealers. They are set into mastic, much like 
resilient tiles. <PERSON>Todd Hamar</PERSON> of Galleher Hardwood says, "Laminates are not on a 
par with block parquets, but they come in attractive patterns and, unlike 
blocks, they can be installed by do-it-yourselfers." 
</P>
<P>
In his book, "Hardwood Flooring," expert <PERSON>Dan Ramsey</PERSON> cautions homeowners to buy 
only from reputable dealers. He adds that, if buyers tell dealers they are 
shopping around for discounted flooring, most retailers "will either work out 
some type of discount or . . . suggest when that discount will be available." 
</P>
<P>
About half of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s strip flooring is sold prefinished, a boon for 
non-professional installers. Prefinished floors are virtually maintenance-free. 
</P>
<P>
Renovators are advised to scratch a coin against an old, discolored floor. If 
the finish doesn't flake off, it is probably penetrating seal, which can be 
restored without sanding. Sometimes worn, dingy floors merely need a 
wax-stripper, a new coat of linseed oil, a treatment with turpentine-soaked 
steel wool to remove old shellac or a liquid varnish remover and a light 
sanding. 
</P>
<P>
Unfinished and ruined floors require a great deal more work and are best left 
to professionals. Mistakes in installation and finishing are apt to cost far 
more than the fee charged by a professional who knows how to match obsolete 
patterns, protect and beautify wood, make new floors look antique and old 
floors look new. 
</P>
<P>
Once the floor has been installed or restored to its original luster, it should 
never be washed or wet-mopped. Scrubbing rots wood. However impervious the 
finish, water can seep between boards to stain and warp them. All the floor 
needs is vacuuming or dust-mopping, an occasional buff to remove heel marks and 
rewaxing once or twice a year. 
</P>
<P>
DAMAGE CONTROL 
</P>
<P>
Buy good flooring. 
</P>
<P>
Carefully inspect floorboards before accepting delivery. 
</P>
<P>
If lumber is stored outdoors, protect it from dampness. 
</P>
<P>
Acclimate new flooring by storing it two to three days in the room where it 
will be installed. 
</P>
<P>
Do all necessary painting before installing the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Never install flooring until all interior concrete is dry. 
</P>
<P>
Flooring over a cement slab requires special protection and expert advice. 
</P>
<P>
Never install wood floors in a damp basement or one susceptible to flooding. 
</P>
<P>
When estimating cost, remember that quoted lumber dimensions are less than 
actual size (a 2-by-4 measures 1 1/2 by 3 1/2 inches). <PERSON>Dan Ramsey</PERSON>'s rule of 
thumb: actual board footage equals number of pieces by thickness by width by 
length divided by 12. 
</P>
<P>
Insulate floors over furnaces and heating ducts to prevent future cracks. 
</P>
<P>
Insulate to soundproof upstairs floors. 
</P>
<P>
When planning floors, never assume walls are straight. They seldom are. 
</P>
<P>
For a professional look, frame obstacles, such as hearths and pillars, with 
mitered molding. 
</P>
<P>
Save short flooring strips for doorways and closets. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid hollows, never let a turned-on drum sander touch the ground unless it 
is moving. 
</P>
<P>
Dust thoroughly after each sanding. 
</P>
<P>
When applying finish, always allow recommended drying time between coats. 
</P>
<P>
If a damaged spot cannot be invisibly patched, refinish the entire floorboard. 
</P>
<P>
When moving heavy furniture, slide it along the floor on a scrap of blanket or 
carpeting. 
</P>
<P>
Rubber, plastic and foam-backed mats may discolor floors. 
</P>
<P>
Put cups under metal furniture casters. 
</P>
<P>
If humidity exceeds <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT>, ventilate rooms to keep floorboards from swelling. 
</P>
<P>
In very cold or dry weather, humidify rooms to keep floorboards from shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
In rainy weather, close windows, protect exterior doorways, repair leaks and 
don't track water across the floor. 
</P>
<P>
FLOOR REPAIR 
</P>
<P>
For fine lines and cracks in hardwood: humidify room. 
</P>
<P>
For cracks between softwood planks: clean out and pack with hemp rope or a wood 
glue-and-sawdust paste. (plastic fillers shrink.) Span very wide cracks with 
wood strips. Sand, stain and rewax. 
</P>
<P>
For "bouncy" floors: check beneath house for undersized joists. Hire a 
professional to stabilize or augment them. 
</P>
<P>
For a squeaky floorboard: for wet weather squeak, soak with liquid wax. Or pour 
talcum powder or powdered graphite between boards. For persistent squeak, drive 
triangular glaziers' points between boards. Tamp down with a putty knife. Or 
countersink 2-inch finishing nails through both ends of board, putty nail 
holes, sand and wax. 
</P>
<P>
For creaking floors: see whether nails holding subfloor to joists have 
loosened. If so, drive wedge between joist and loose subfloor board. If several 
boards are loose, nail a strip of wood across them and secure it to joist. 
</P>
<P>
For a loose board in the finish floor: countersink 2-inch finishing nails with 
a nail punch, angling them into subfloor. Putty, sand and stain nail holes. 
Rewax. 
</P>
<P>
For warped, bulging finish floorboards: cover with heavy paper and a plank. Tap 
plank sharply with a hammer, taking care not to split tongued-and-grooved 
edges. 
</P>
<P>
For sagging or inward-sloping floors: see if girders or joists have been 
undermined by rot or termites. Fumigate if necessary. Raise gradually, a few 
turns per day, with horizontal timbers supported by concrete-footed jack posts 
or screw-jacks and vertical timbers. 
</P>
<P>
For outward-sloping floors: raise gradually with jack posts beneath outer 
edges. 
</P>
<P>
For old floors at different levels in different rooms: install threshholds to 
mask discrepancies. 
</P>
<P>
To replace damaged floorboards: hire a professional. 
</P>
<P>
To match a few obsolete floorboards: steal them from an inconspicuous area, 
such as a closet. 
</P>
<P>
To duplicate a roomful of obsolete floorboards: ask a professional to find the 
same type of lumber and "age" it to match. 
</P>
<P>
To replace a damaged parquet square: check to see if it is screwed as well as 
glued. Remove. Scrape off old mastic. Glue in new square. 
</P>
<P>
To repair loose strips in a parquet block: find and eliminate the dampness that 
loosened them. Reglue. 
</P>
<P>
To replace a missing piece of parquetry: trim jagged edges. Scrape out old 
mastic. Outline cavity on tracing paper. Darken back of paper with soft pencil. 
Find a similar strip of wood, making sure grain goes the right way. Press 
tracing paper on wood, shaded side down. Re-outline shape on wood. Cut out with 
utility knife. Sand underside to proper thickness. Stain if necessary. Glue in. 
Replicate dark outline with felt pen. 
</P>
<P>
For swollen veneer: cover with cardboard. Press with a hot iron, bearing down 
hard. Leave a heavy weight on cardboard for 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
For dents: cover with a damp cloth. Steam-iron. 
</P>
<P>
For scratches: use filler, then wax. Or buy a touch-up kit from flooring 
dealer. 
</P>
<P>
For worm holes: with an oilcan, squirt commercial wood worm solution into 
holes. Let stand 24 hours. Wipe off excess. Patch holes with filler. Sand and 
wax. 
</P>
<P>
STAIN REMOVAL 
</P>
<P>
Alcohol spots: rub with wax, silver polish, boiled linseed oil or a cloth 
lightly dampened with ammonia. 
</P>
<P>
Bloodstains: rub with wax-stripper. Rewax. 
</P>
<P>
Chewing gum, candle wax and crayon: apply a plastic bag filled with ice cubes. 
Leave on until substance is brittle enough to crumble. Wax stripper or cleaning 
fluid poured around the area, not on it, may loosen substance. 
</P>
<P>
Cigarette burns: for shallow burns, rub lightly with fine steel wool dampened 
with soap and water. Wipe with damp cloth. Dry thoroughly. For deep burns, 
carefully sand away, fill indentation, fine-sand smooth and rewax. 
</P>
<P>
Dark spots, ink stains and pet or diaper stains: if fresh, wash off and bleach 
with lemon juice on a cotton pad. If old, scrub spot and surrounding area with 
No. 1 steel wool moistened with floor cleaner. Pour on vinegar. Leave three to 
four hours. If spot remains, carefully pour on household bleach. Leave two 
hours. If spot remains, fine-sand, feathering into surrounding area. Rewax and 
buff. If spot remains, bleach with 1 ounce oxalic acid in 1 quart water. Wear 
gloves. It is toxic. Let stand one hour. Sponge with clean water. Repeat if 
necessary. If spot remains, sand with 00 paper and feather new finish into 
surrounding area. Rub lightly with 00 steel wool. Apply a second coat. Dry and 
rewax. 
</P>
<P>
Dried milk or food: rub with damp cloth. Dry. Rewax. 
</P>
<P>
Heel and caster marks: rub lightly with fine steel wool moistened with floor 
cleaner. Wipe dry. Polish. 
</P>
<P>
Mold or mildew: ventilate room. Rub with a good floor cleaner or cleaning 
fluid. 
</P>
<P>
Oil and grease: rub with strong kitchen soap. Or cover with white tissue paper 
and press with a hot iron to soak up stain. Or rub with lighter fluid. Or cover 
with a cotton pad saturated in hydrogen peroxide and top with another pad 
saturated in household ammonia. Repeat until stain is gone. Then clean, dry and 
rewax. 
</P>
<P>
Standing water stains: rub with 00 steel wool and rewax. Or fine-sand, then rub 
with No. 1 steel wool moistened with floor cleaner or mineral spirits. Let dry. 
Refinish, feathering into surrounding area. Rewax.

<LEADPARA>  WHEN selecting replacement fixtures for a bathroom remodeling project, most
homeowners limit their selection to what will fit through the bathroom door.; 
 But a whole new range of possibilities opens up when you consider fixtures
designed for new homes. These tend to be built on a grander scale, are more
luxurious, and have more built-in amenities.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Home  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  GO GRAND WITH NEW-HOME FIXTURES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     A shower unit, for example, may have features such as one-piece
construction and molded-in seat and shelves. The reason these units are
designed for new homes is that they can be installed before all the walls are
in place.;   Window eases installation; You can install these oversize
fixtures in your remodeling project by opening an access in an exterior wall.
This usually involves removing a window and the framing below. If there's no
window, you'll have to cut a hole in the wall, which requires temporary
support for the ceiling or roof above.;   To remove the window, first take off
the interior casing. From the outside, pry the window from the rough opening.
With the window free, lift it out bottom first and let it slide down into the
opening as you pull it out.;   If you remove the window from the top, it could
topple and fall on you.;   Back inside, remove the wall covering under the
window frame. Remove the sill and also the cripples, which are the small studs
that hold it up. Do not remove the bottom plate.;   Ladders protect
fiberglass; To install an oversize shower stall in an upstairs bathroom, carry
it up two ladders, rather than sliding it up a ladder, to protect the
fiberglass. Once the unit is through the opening, reinstall the sill,
cripples, sheathing and siding.;   Before installing the fixture, relocate the
waste pipe if necessary. To make the job easier, use flexible, coiled tubing
rather than straight pipe.;   If your fixture includes a tub unit, gently tap
shims underneath the tub to level the unit. Fasten the unit's top flange to
the wall studs with roofing nails. If the flange is not pre-bored for these
nails, bore clearance holes to avoid cracking the fiberglass. Protect the
bottom of the tub with old carpet or cardboard since you'll be standing in it
to work.;   Install the drain, sealing it with plumber's putty. The overflow
riser fits into the port opening with a gasket. Use plumber's putty there,
too. If you're working in a tight area, frame out your partition wall at the
end of the enclosure after the plumbing is complete.;   Line up your water
supply and install the diverter valve. The diverter comes assembled and the
manufacturer supplies working dimensions for the installation.;   Lay out
these dimensions on the enclosure and drill through the fiberglass into a
block of wood with a spade bit to avoid chipping. Connect the hot and cold
supply lines to the diverter and secure it to the fiberglass by adding the
faucet handles on the inside surface. You can install the diverter riser for
the shower head above the shower enclosure.;   The riser pipe is supported by
a block nailed to two studs in the end wall framing. Once the tub is set,
frame out a 2-by-4 wall behind the diverter and around the plumbing.  </TEXT>

   Seiderman died <DATE>July 18</DATE> in <LOCATION>Port Angeles</LOCATION> of a heart attack, said
<PERSON>Dan Verheul</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Sequim Valley Chapel Funeral Directors</ORGANIZATION>.
   He emigrated from <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> in the <DATE>1920s</DATE>, living first in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>
and then studying art in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. He joined RKO Studios in
<LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, as a junior member of the makeup department in
the early <DATE>1930s</DATE>.
   Confronted with the problem of aging the characters in ``Citizen
Kane'' as much as 50 years, he made a series of plaster casts of
the actors and sculpted pieces of molded plastic foam in which
their features gradually sagged and their hair thinned.
   Seiderman also produced the disfigured faces in ``Enchanted
Cottage''; makeup and wigs in ``Gunga Din'' and ``The Hunchback of
Notre Dame''; and worked on such Welles classic films as ``The
Magnificent Ambersons'' and ``Macbeth.''
   He made <PERSON>Raymond Massey</PERSON> into ``Abe Lincoln in <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>' and
<PERSON>Judith Anderson</PERSON> into ``Lady Scarface.''
   He also was an inventor who researched the use of contact lenses
and held several patents in that field. It was his skill there that
produced the aging eyes of the actors.
   Late in life, he became an artist, painting abstracts on slides
under a microscope he designed himself.
   He is survived by his wife, <PERSON>Celita</PERSON>, and a brother.

a few blocks south. After a garbage can was set on fire and some rocks were
thrown at police, riot squads tore through the park, chasing everyone out.;   
Through most of the evening, the situation had been far more peaceful than the
previous two nights, when protesters set bonfires, smashed store windows and
threw bottles and rocks at police.;    The protesters are seeking to block the

FT  20 FEB 93 / Arts: A them-versus-us motif in Berlin - Nigel Andrews
experiences everything from King Kong to Wittgenstein at the film festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERYTHING perked up with the arrival of <LOCATION>King Kong</LOCATION>. The natives were getting
restless, and so were the visitors, as the <ORGANIZATION>43rd Berlin Film Festival</ORGANIZATION>
floundered through early days. Then came a 60th birthday screening of <LOCATION>Kong</LOCATION>,
preceded by the raising of a 20-foot effigy atop the festival theatre.
This woke us all up. Cheered by the sight of a chained ape gesticulating
from a cinema roof, we forgot the pain of that interminable Japanese film
about gay street life; of that hectoring Swedish short about feminist fairy
tales; of that fantasy-clotted Competition opener <ORGANIZATION>Arizona Dreams</ORGANIZATION>, made by
ex-Yugoslavian <PERSON>Emir Kusturica</PERSON> with a cast twinning <PERSON>Faye Dunaway</PERSON> with <PERSON>Jerry
Lewis</PERSON>. And we tried to forget the worst disappointment of all: the sight of
<PERSON>Jack Nicholson</PERSON> with putty-face make-up piloting through <PERSON>David Mamet</PERSON>'s
putty-brained script for <PERSON>Hoffa</PERSON>.
This at least brought <PERSON>Danny DeVito</PERSON> to town as co-star and director. Small
and round, <PERSON>DeVito</PERSON> resembled one of those objects marked 'bomb' in
comic-strips. His tongue was the fuse, fizzing away at press conferences to
prove you cannot dampen a Hollywood trouper even when the world dislikes his
film.
If <PERSON>Hoffa</PERSON> was a dull fresco about the postwar American labour movement and
the disappearance of <ORGANIZATION>Teamsters</ORGANIZATION> boss <PERSON>Jimmy Hoffa</PERSON> in the <DATE>1970s</DATE> - murdered,
surmises <PERSON>Mamet</PERSON>, by <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> in concert with the mafia - <PERSON>Spike Lee</PERSON>'s
Malcolm X and <PERSON>Derek Jarman</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Wittgenstein</PERSON> added to the <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> bio-pic count
and the them-versus-us motif.
Lee's film attempts to combine crowd-pleasing storytelling with radical
politics and fails. (More when it opens in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.) Jarman, less
reverently, turns the life of the Viennese-born, Cambridge-naturalised
philosopher into a lantern slide lecture with intervals for wacky comedy.
These last feature, inter alios, <ORGANIZATION>Tilda Swinton</ORGANIZATION> whooping it up in feathers as
Lady <PERSON>Ottoline Morrell</PERSON> and <PERSON>John Quentin</PERSON> snapping out the <ORGANIZATION>Bloomsbury</ORGANIZATION>
one-liners as, yes, <PERSON>John Maynard Keynes</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Terry Eagleton</PERSON>'s episodic script - should we call it Brechtian? - is clever
but low on dramatic voltage. It needs <PERSON>Jarman</PERSON>'s fluidity of staging, turning
a black-backed soundstage into perpetuum mobile of foreground colour and
motion, to provide pace and warmth. This and <PERSON>Karl Johnson</PERSON>'s performance as
<PERSON>Ludwig</PERSON> W: a sweet, despair-prone gibberer, in whom passion and pedantry live
like a permanently quarrelling married couple.
But a few bio-pics go a long way. The best two films at <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> came hot from
the imagination's kiln, complete with colourfully glazed images. From <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>,
<PERSON>Xie Fei</PERSON>'s The Lake Of Scented Souls is a domestic melodrama heated to
tragedy. A village businesswoman, whose sesame-oil factory is eyed by the
Japanese, finds career pressures compounded by emotional ones. Her retarded
son abuses his newly 'arranged' bride; and the mother's own marriage, which
she was sold into at 13, is now crashing on the rocks of a drunken husband
and a lover who is an increasingly ill-kept secret.
Soap opera it could have been. Real opera it almost becomes. The director
blends Visconti-ish verismo in the images - sunsets glow with pain, lakes
sparkle with a sickly, piercing silver - with an overpowering central
performance. Siquin Gaowa as the <ORGANIZATION>Madame Bovary</ORGANIZATION> of the marshlands, running
through all known emotions and the hell with Oriental inscrutability, should
get a Best Actress nod or there is no justice in juries.
If the Chinese film is verismo, <PERSON>Robert Rodriguez</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>El Mariachi</ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>
is opera buffa. This gloriously eccentric action thriller cost Dollars 7,000
to make - one day's cigar money on most Hollywood films - and then burned
giant holes in the Latin American box office. It was promptly optioned by
<LOCATION>Tinseltown</LOCATION> for an upcoming Dollars 7m English-language remake.
The remake could not possibly equal the original, which resembles a <ORGANIZATION>Sergio
Leone Western</ORGANIZATION> made with mind-influencing narcotics. A zooming, carooming,
running, jumping, never-standing-still camera follows the hero and villain
around streets and deserts, unwittingly twinned by fate since they carry
identical black guitar-cases. (One contains a music instrument, the other an
arsenal of guns). A screen aflame with shoot-outs, punch-ups and comical
misunderstandings is set further ablaze by the filmmaker's wild ingenuities
of style.
Only one other <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> film seriously warmed the imagination. Atom <LOCATION>Egoyan</LOCATION>'s
Calendar will win no prizes (not in competition) and may win no British
release (65 minutes of unclassifiable semi-fiction). Yet the Canadian-based
director of The Adjuster here re-visits his ancestral roots in <LOCATION>Armenia</LOCATION> -
commissioned to take photos for a tourist calendar - and extemporises a
truth-based tale of marital break-up.
Main characters: himself (often a poignantly interrogative voice off
camera), his Armenian-born wife and the local guide who becomes her lover.
While a foreign sun shines on their bilingual imbroglios, flash-forwards
depict <LOCATION>Egoyan</LOCATION> back in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> caught in the misery of serial dating. He tries
to snare new girlfriends while the now published calendar glows from his
wall, keeping alive old wounds. This beautifully cunning film about time,
space and emotional paradox is as intricate and many-angled as its own
heraldic leitmotif: the Byzantine churches that gaze timelessly, pitilessly,
majestically from the skylines.
Two other movies deserve nods in the fair-to-enjoyable category. Love Field,
directed by <PERSON>Jonathan Kaplan</PERSON> (The Accused), pushes Oscar-nominated <PERSON>Michelle
Pfeiffer</PERSON> into a black-and-white love story in glorious Technicolor. He's
black (<PERSON>Dennis Haysbert</PERSON>), she's white and they meet in the emotionally
colourful aftermath of <ORGANIZATION>JFK</ORGANIZATION>'s assassination.
<PERSON>Idrissa Ouedraogo</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Samba Traore</ORGANIZATION>, from <LOCATION>Burkino Faso</LOCATION>, is a sweetly acidic
village comedy from the maker of Yaaba and <ORGANIZATION>Tilai</ORGANIZATION>. Berliners complained that
the movie showed signs of Westernisation - good heavens, a robbery in scene
one and more action to come. But storytelling is no crime, and the same
critics were last heard complaining that <PERSON>Ouedraogo</PERSON>'s previous films had no
plot. This one is wry, satiric and subtly humanist; and filmed in a burning
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> that seems at once a godless wilderness and a crucible for godly
miracles.
Elsewhere <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> has been an assault course of the unbelievable and/or
unendurable. While the Golden Bear scans the horizon for likely winners, a
series of Plastic Bears should be minted for such un-recyclable rubbish as
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s Heya, with its minimalist tale of a hitman who never hits; or
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s Lilies Of <ORGANIZATION>The Bank</ORGANIZATION>, proving like Schtonk] that there is no such
thing as German comedy; or <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>'s Life According To <ORGANIZATION>Agfa</ORGANIZATION>. This last is a
sort of Iceman Cometh for the age of Palestinian-Israeli tension, its
one-bar setting squeezed for maximum melodrama by director <PERSON>Assi Dayan</PERSON>, son
of Moshe.
Why does <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> import these turkeys? Perhaps because <LOCATION>Cannes</LOCATION> is just around
the corner in early <DATE>May</DATE>, offering higher kudos for superior products. Or
perhaps because <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> is still seeking an identity, now that the fallen
Wall has robbed the event of its political dialectic.
Until <DATE>1990</DATE> this festival stood by the tennis net of Euro-politics, a
cultural umpire to the game of East versus <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>. Today the balls whizzing by
come from all quarters, in all shapes, sizes and colours. Hooray that the
Cold War spirit and structure have been swept aside. But <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> badly needs
a new identity if it not to become merely <LOCATION>Cannes</LOCATION> the Prequel: situated too
close in time and too far in place, in a frozen North - and <ORGANIZATION>Kong</ORGANIZATION> is mantled
in snow as I speak - which few will prefer to the sunnier, more
movie-bountiful Cote d'Azur.

<DESCRIPT>  SUNNYVALE; MOUNTAIN-VIEW; CITY; MASS-TRANSIT; RAILROAD; MEETING  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  In the high-stakes game of selecting where to put Santa Clara County's next
light-rail line, both competitors have their advantages:;    (check) Mountain
View has an appealing downtown -- complete with a spanking new performing arts
center -- to attract riders. Sunnyvale has only grandiose plans for one.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  2 CITIES BID TO BOARD LIGHT RAIL
HEARINGS DISCUSS ROUTE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     (check) <LOCATION>Sunnyvale</LOCATION> is strategically located, making it easy to extend a
future light-rail line to <LOCATION>Cupertino</LOCATION>. Getting there from <ORGANIZATION>Mountain View</ORGANIZATION> would be
longer and costlier -- maybe <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY> costlier.;    Hearings help decide
issue;  This week, a series of three public hearings on where the line goes
next will help determine who will be the winner of what is known as the Tasman
Corridor extension.;    "It's pretty close," said <PERSON>San Jose City Councilman Jim
Beall</PERSON>, who serves on the Tasman Corridor policy subcommittee, which will play
a major role in selecting the line's terminus. The corridor runs from <LOCATION>Milpitas</LOCATION>
in the east to Mountain View in the northwest.;    "It's a very hard choice,"
echoed <PERSON>Santa Clara Mayor Sue Lasher</PERSON>, who also has a vote.;    The stakes are
high enough that each city has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on
public relations and consultants. Though <LOCATION>Sunnyvale</LOCATION> has a larger population and
employment base, <ORGANIZATION>Mountain View</ORGANIZATION> is denser, with a true downtown. Both offer
stations within a quarter-mile walking distance of about 70,000 people.;   
Final choice likely by <DATE>July 23</DATE>;  The winner must be decided by <DATE>July 18</DATE>; on
<DATE>July 23</DATE>, the county board of supervisors, acting as the <ORGANIZATION>Transit Board</ORGANIZATION>, in all
likelihood will rubber-stamp the subcommittee's decision.;    So far, no one
is predicting the outcome. Of the eight officials on the subcommittee, two are
clearly for <LOCATION>Sunnyvale</LOCATION> -- Supervisor <PERSON>Ron Gonzales</PERSON>, whose district includes
<LOCATION>Sunnyvale</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Sunnyvale Councilman Larry Stone</ORGANIZATION> -- and two are leaning toward
Mountain View -- Supervisor <PERSON>Dianne McKenna</PERSON>, whose district includes Mountain
View, and <ORGANIZATION>Mountain View Mayor Art Takahara</ORGANIZATION>. The other four -- Supervisor <PERSON>Rod
Diridon</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Milpitas</LOCATION> Vice-Mayor <PERSON>Jim Lawson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Beall</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lasher</PERSON> -- say they are
undecided.;    One reason for the waffling is that the project's "numbers" are
like Silly Putty, and numbers -- such as which route would pull in the most
new transit riders at the lowest cost -- are what most say the decision should
be based on.;    Cost estimates vary; The line from <ORGANIZATION>Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space
Co.</ORGANIZATION> to downtown <LOCATION>Sunnyvale</LOCATION> could cost <MONEY>$66 million</MONEY>, for instance. Or <MONEY>$105
million</MONEY>. From Lockheed to downtown <ORGANIZATION>Mountain View</ORGANIZATION> could cost <MONEY>$75 million</MONEY>. Or
<MONEY>$93 million</MONEY>. Even the ridership figures in the draft environmental impact
report -- currently projecting the Mountain View option to attract about 500
more daily riders -- are subject to change.;    "If you build a big high-rise
building (near one line), things can change," said <PERSON>Beall</PERSON>. "Who knows what they
can be.";    Since the cost estimates do not make the choice obvious,
officials are developing their own set of criteria.;    Sweetening the deal; 
<PERSON>Diridon</PERSON> and <PERSON>Beall</PERSON> want to see how hard each city's politicians are willing to
publicly lobby for an extension of the county's half-cent sales tax. <PERSON>Diridon</PERSON>
also wants to know if either one is willing to make a cash contribution to
sweeten to deal.;    "If one of the cities were to step forward and say 'We'll
give you <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY>,' that would be important," said Diridon.;    Mountain
View, which just completed a performing arts and city hall complex, has no
extra cash. But <LOCATION>Sunnyvale</LOCATION> has indicated it might be willing to contribute <MONEY>$15
million</MONEY> toward the project if it goes to <LOCATION>Sunnyvale</LOCATION> and runs down <LOCATION>Pastoria
Avenue</LOCATION> rather than <PERSON>Mathilda Avenue</PERSON>, said Stone.;     IF YOU'RE INTERESTED;
There will be three public hearings on the Tasman Corridor light rail
extension this week. The first will be at <TIME>7 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>today</DATE> at <LOCATION>Techmart</LOCATION>, Suite 113,
<LOCATION>5201 Great America Parkway</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Santa Clara</LOCATION>. The second hearing will be at <TIME>7 p.m.</TIME>
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> in the <ORGANIZATION>Berryessa School District Board Room</ORGANIZATION>, <DATE>1376</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Piedmont Road</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>San
Jose</LOCATION>. The third hearing is at <TIME>2 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Thursday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Clara County
Transportation Agency</ORGANIZATION>, in the auditorium of Building 2, <DATE>1555</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Berger Drive</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>San

<LEADPARA>  IN WRITING this column it's nice to know that when I get stumped, I can put
the question out to readers and somebody always has an answer.;   I didn't
have an answer for the question, "Where could I obtain plans for a windmill
that will pump water?" but reader Charlie Hafner of Fremont did. He suggests
sending $1 for a catalog of plans for building a wide variety of home, farm
and ranch products to: Lindsay Technical Publications, P.O. Box 538, Bradley,
Ill. 60915; (815) 935-5353. Hafner also notes that there is an association of
windmill collectors that publishes a quarterly newsletter. Windmillers'
Gazette, P.O. Box 507, Rio Vista, Texas 76093, is $10 for a one-year
subscription.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     When a reader asked about a shower head that resembled the head on a garden
watering can, I drew a complete blank.;   Reader <PERSON>Jolene Silva</PERSON> of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>
responded with a photocopy of a catalog page showing a "sunflower showerhead,"
that looks exactly like the head on a watering can. The antique reproduction
head is available from The Antique Hardware Store, RD2, Box A, Route 611,
<LOCATION>Kintnersville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Penn.</LOCATION> 18930; (800) 422-9982.; Q How do I remove old foam
weatherstripping tape from a door frame? The foam is gummy in some spots and
seems to be baked to the molding.; A Remove as much of the foam as possible by
pulling it off. This will expose the tape that was used to adhere the foam to
the door frame. Heat the tape with a hair dryer and scrape the tape with a
flat piece of soft wood. Tapering the end on a wood paint stirring stick works
well or you can use a plastic putty knife to slowly scrape the heated tape
away. The residue that remains can be cleaned away by using <PERCENT>99 percent</PERCENT>
isopropyl alcohol on a cloth.; Q I'm about to sell my house and would like to
wax or in some way put a finish over the plastic counter tops in the kitchen.
What will do this?; A Restoring plastic laminate is difficult, but I think
you'll see some improvement by polishing the surface with <ORGANIZATION>Meguiar</ORGANIZATION>'s Mirror
Glaze 10 Professional Plastic Polish. Follow this with a few coats of
Kleenmaster Brillianize. Both are available from companies that sell acrylic
plastics or from some auto or motorcycle parts stores.; Q I'm told that some
company manufactures furnace registers that come in different colors so they
don't need to be painted, but I can't find them anywhere.; A You'll find wall
registers in rose, cream, blue, tan, gray and brass shown in the <ORGANIZATION>Sears Mobile
Home</ORGANIZATION> catalog. However, they are only available to fit 8-by-4-inch and
10-by-4-inch openings. I suspect you are trying to avoid the paint build-up
the comes from rolling on or brushing paint on registers. Consider buying
registers from a hardware, home center or heating and air-conditioning
company, and spraying them with a good quality finish.;   You can find floor
registers in oak, brass and chrome at hardware stores and home centers.  </TEXT>

ASK THE HANDYMAN: CRACKS IN CULTURED-MARBLE COUNTER LEAVE FEW OPTIONS FOR 
HOMEOWNER

Q: Less than a year ago, I installed a cultured-marble counter and sink in our 
second bathroom, and in a very short time, I've noticed small hairline cracks 
forming around the drain. Is there any way I can just buff those out? 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>S.A.</ORGANIZATION>, 
</P>
<P>
Lake Forest 
</P>
<P>
A: "That's unusual for a new sink to develop cracks like that," says <PERSON>Larry 
Hohenstein</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Amco Builders</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Plumbing Supply</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Costa Mesa</LOCATION>. "They usually 
form with age. There's really not much you can do at this point because of the 
way the sinks are made. Cultured marble is made with a plastic overlay that 
gives it color. However, what happens is that during normal use, when you get 
toothpaste, cleansers, drain cleaners and all the other things people put in 
their sinks onto the surface, it destroys the plastic. When it gets to the 
point where you're really embarrassed by it, you'll just have to replace it. 
</P>
<P>
"There is one product, <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> cultured onyx, that can be repaired. It's a little 
more expensive than the marble, but when you have cracks, you can attach a 
lambs-wool pad to your drill and buff them out." 
</P>
<P>
Q: The plaster surrounding the outside of my shower has formed blisters in 
which the plaster has bubbled and inside there's a powdery substance. I would 
assume it's caused by moisture. How do I get rid of it? 
</P>
<P>
T.L.,

La Habra

<P>
A: "It sounds like it's a gypsum plaster, and what really needs to be used in 
that area is a cement plaster or a cement backer board with tile, something 
that won't absorb water," says <PERSON>Lee Ferguson</PERSON> of Alpine Plastering in <LOCATION>Fullerton</LOCATION>. 
"Ideally, the plaster in that area should be removed down to the bare studs and 
a paper-back lath should be put on, then the cement plaster applied on top of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Q: Isn't there something I can put on my hands and arms while painting that 
will keep paint from sticking to my skin?

A: "Try a product called 'Glove Coat' that you rub into your hands before 
painting," says <PERSON>Mike Payne</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Vista Paint in Orange</ORGANIZATION>. "After painting, you just 
wash with soap and water, and it should come right off." 
</P>
<P>
Q: In remodeling our bathroom, I'd like to keep the present bathroom tile, 
remove the tub enclosure and install a shower curtain. However, the enclosure 
is about 9 years old, and I'm afraid that once we get it off, we won't be able 
to make the tile on the walls that are underneath match the rest of the tiles. 
Any suggestions?

A: "When an enclosure has been there for years, it will tend to discolor the 
tile," says <PERSON>John Wintercorn</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Martin Shower Door</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chino</LOCATION>. "Unfortunately, 
there's no magic solution to remove it. After removing an enclosure, we will 
scrape it with a putty knife and then a single-blade razor to remove any 
caulking, then go over it with scouring powder. I've heard of people using pool 
acid to try to get stains off, but that's really too dangerous to work with. 
I'd recommend just trying with abrasives and filling in the holes left by the 
enclosure with some type of quick-setting sealant."

Q: In rearranging furniture, I found a problem with a lamp I'd like to have sit 
on a corner table. In order for it to work, I would have to string the cord 10 
feet to the nearest wall socket. Would it be hard to string the cord under the 
carpet to the socket?

A: "That's probably the easiest and best solution; the only problem is it's 
illegal," says <ORGANIZATION>Arlan Strong of Uni-Lite</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Anaheim</LOCATION>. "The fire codes say you 
can't have electrical cords under rugs, mainly because they're stepped on a 
great deal and they get worn and you don't notice it until it starts a fire. 
The only other way to do it without having the cord show is to install an 
outlet on the floor."

   People were tied up in knots over Silly
String until the <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> banned its sale and use.
   But since that action <DATE>Monday</DATE>, police face the sticky question of
enforcing the prohibition against the plastic shot from a can.
   ``We have the discretion to enforce the law and we will use it,''
acting Police Chief <PERSON>Joseph Barry</PERSON> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. ``We're not going to
go up to people and say, `This is a Silly String raid.'''
   Silly String became a problem at this year's Labor Day parade
when vendors sold it to young spectators.
   ``Every kid had a can of the stuff,'' <PERSON>Barry</PERSON> said. They sprayed
passing cars, pedestrians, fire trucks and anything else they could
think of, he said.
   ``The <ORGANIZATION>Department of Public Works</ORGANIZATION> had a horrendous time cleaning
it up,'' he said.
   Violators of the ban face a fine as high as <MONEY>$200</MONEY>.
   Many Marlboro stores stopped selling Silly String after Halloween.
   ``I have to wrestle with my conscience every time I sell it,''
said one vendor, who asked not to be identified. ``It's horrible.''
   <PERSON>Nathan Rossi</PERSON>, 15, disagreed. ``The stuff is awesome!'' he said.
   ``You sit there and spray people when they go by, '' said <PERSON>Rae
Campbell</PERSON>, 15. ``It's great.''

<HL> REVIEW &amp; OUTLOOK (Editorial): The Great Communicator </HL>
<SO> </SO>
<G> EXE </G>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> speaks tonight. 
For the delegates he will address at the <ORGANIZATION>Republican National Convention</ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION>New Orleans Superdome</LOCATION> and for the millions watching on TV the general impression of <PERSON>Mr. Reagan</PERSON>'s performance will be familiar: Nobody does it better. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Reagan</PERSON>'s communications skills are praised by his admirers but even more by his critics. 
The latter invoke this attribute, plus luck, to explain his undeniable success. 
There is little question that more than any other modern politician, the 77-year-old <PERSON>Mr. Reagan</PERSON> understands the TV medium. 
At times this attribute has been accorded powers less appropriate to an American President than to <PERSON>Merlin</PERSON> the Magician. 
His policy ideas were often largely bankrupt, the idea runs, but he put them across to the electorate with his special powers of communication. 
The bobbing head, the glistening eyes, the little stories, the voice, <PERSON>Mike Deaver</PERSON> manipulating the hands and arms, the <ORGANIZATION>Great Communicator</ORGANIZATION>. 

   This success-through-voodoo theory of the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> presidency is ludicrous on its face, and more important misses the essential point about not only <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> but also what currently passes for the modern political process. 
<PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> does indeed have communications skills. 
What he also has are beliefs. 
What most other politicians have today are "positions." 

   The difference is profound. 
Many voters have become deeply cynical about the things politicians say. 
Falling election turnouts at all levels are one symptom of the voters' skepticism. 
Their skepticism is justified. 
The pols' obsessive opinion polling and their desire for big-audience TV exposure make them afraid to take stands that might give offense. 
The modern politician's fluid, hedged positions would astound, say, the average commodities trader. 

   Now consider <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON>. 
Whatever one's opinion of his politics, hardly anyone has ever questioned that he truly believes what he is saying. 
The constant appeals to the free market and the power of individual enterprise, the tax cuts, the desire to control spending while restoring the country's defenses, an ardent anticommunism that grew into the <PERSON>Reagan Doctrine</PERSON>, his commitment to "ridding the world" of nuclear missiles, a relentless patriotism and optimism that struck some as almost corny. 

   Raised in small-town <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> really did come across like a character out of the movies Hollywood once made about Midwesterners living on plain verities. 
Some of us believe those old movies got it about right, too. 
The pundits often derided him for all this, but they never doubted its sincerity. 
Indeed they often cited it as a reflection of <PERSON>Mr. Reagan</PERSON>'s naivete. 
The idea of building technologies to protect the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> from incoming ICBMs was laughed at as "<PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON>'s dream." 

   Or worse, they said he was captive to a rigid ideology. 
Their tastes ran to more pragmatic politicians. 
But ideology, stripped of its recent pejorative connotation, is simply a deeply held core of beliefs. 
Pragmatism, as now practiced and admired in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, inevitably requires allowing one's ideas to be mangled and bounced around like Silly Putty, or routinely selling them out for a handful of votes. 
They're pragmatists all right, but who knows what most of these modern politicians believe in? 

   Certainly, belief doesn't ensure success. 
Success in the end means not only having strong ideas but also having the right ideas -- and the confidence to stand fast for them. 
In the face of much derision, <PERSON>Mr. Reagan</PERSON> stood by the belief that cutting taxes would spur the economy. 
Eight years later, the rest of the world is cutting taxes to drive growth and restore the individual's incentive to work hard. 
In his first term, <PERSON>Mr. Reagan</PERSON>'s commitment to an active defense posture was mocked as cowboy foreign policy. 
Today the paradox of the <ORGANIZATION>Reagan Doctrine</ORGANIZATION> is proving out: When the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> toughens up, the world's bullies calm down. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Reagan</PERSON>'s unapologetic belief in his own ideas -- not his communication skills -- explains his popularity with the American people. 
To deny this is to suggest that the American voters are saps. 
They aren't. 
Check out the voters' record: FDR, <PERSON>Truman</PERSON>, <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON>, <LOCATION>JFK</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Lyndon Johnson</PERSON> after some time in the <ORGANIZATION>Oval Office</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON>, the candidate <PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON>. 
The voters have chosen individuals who on balance seemed to be their own men and not someone else's creation. 

   Love him or not, <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON>'s speech tonight will display once again not merely a great communicator but the qualities of political belief that can put, and sustain, a person in the presidency.

REMODELER'S DIARY: GETTING HOUSE IN SHAPE EARLY FOR RETIREMENT SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MONA LOCKE, Locke is an independent writer who lives in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My husband and I were impelled into the wilderness of remodeling in the <DATE>spring 
last year</DATE>. The impetus was our 40-inch kitchen stove, which was about 30 years 
old. The stove was still doing its job, but it was beginning to show its age 
and couldn't bake a level cake. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's get a new one," said my husband, <PERSON>Wil</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
The stove was built into custom cabinets, so we tried to buy another just like 
it but couldn't find a 40-inch stove of any kind. We knew that some major 
cabinet remodeling would be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Refitting the cabinets to accommodate a new stove would also mean rebuilding 
the ceramic countertops, and we knew we couldn't match the existing tile. 
</P>
<P>
With only one of our five children still at home, with college costs almost out 
of the way and retirement plans to be considered, we agreed that any 
improvements to the house should add to its resale value. 
</P>
<P>
Another important consideration was that we wanted to enjoy the fruits of our 
labor for awhile instead of making improvements and redecorating when we were 
ready to sell. 
</P>
<P>
So we made a list of things we wanted to do. In fact, we made several lists, 
juggling needed repairs against desired improvements until we settled on a 
combination we could afford: refinishing floors upstairs and down, getting new 
carpeting, windows, doors and entry tile, plus the final decorator items -- 
paint, wallpaper, draperies, bed covers, area rugs and accessories. 
</P>
<P>
We wanted to lighten and brighten our home in every way possible. And we wanted 
to build an all-new kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
We estimated costs, arranged the financing and then had to decide where to 
begin. We made mistake No. 1 when we started with the flooring. 
</P>
<P>
We knew the other projects -- remodeling the kitchen, replacing entry tile, 
redecorating -- should be done first, but we expected house guests through the 
<DATE>summer</DATE> and didn't want to offer them rooms. We made mistake No. 2 when we 
contracted for the floor refinishing and carpeting with a man sent out to 
measure our rooms by a vendor preparing an estimate. This man said he could 
save us quite a bit of money, and we accepted his offer. 
</P>
<P>
He said it would take two weeks to re-glue and refinish wood parquet floors in 
the master bedroom and hallway, install new wood parquet in the den, refinish 
the hardwood floor in the dining room and install carpeting in three upstairs 
bedrooms and a hallway. 
</P>
<P>
The day he was to start he called to say his truck had broken down. He began 
working two days later with a crew of young men who were neither careful nor 
experienced. 
</P>
<P>
They used the wrong stain on the wood parquet, which then had to be sanded and 
stained again, and installed a different shade of carpet than we ordered 
(though, ultimately, it proved to be better for our color scheme). 
</P>
<P>
The two-week schedule became a two-month nightmare, and we learned all over 
again that you get what you pay for. 
</P>
<P>
Before the flooring was finished, we had the putty replaced on all windows 
(instead of installing new ones). While that was going on, our first house 
guests arrived and, in the midst of a severe heat wave, we were awakened each 
morning at 7 to the sound of the glazers chipping out the old putty. 
</P>
<P>
Folding closet doors were replaced with sliding, mirrored doors in all bedrooms 
and a closet organizing system was installed in the master bedroom -- all 
without mishap or delay. 
</P>
<P>
We shopped for other items, including a garden window for the kitchen. While 
ordering the window, we struck gold. The salesperson we worked with asked if 
we'd thought about consulting a kitchen designer. She highly recommended a 
woman with whom she had studied. Sandra restored our faith in people and our 
own good judgment. She met with us, asked many questions, followed up with 
letters and phone calls, and when we decided to contract with her for 
professional plans, she went into high gear. 
</P>
<P>
She advised us on how to verify the licenses of all contractors and 
subcontractors; how to prepare for interim cooking and dining facilities; which 
contractors and subcontractors to schedule, in which order. 
</P>
<P>
She counseled us on the latest lighting options and provided information on 
where to shop for good buys in fixtures, lighting and flooring. 
</P>
<P>
She also gave us great advice on the new kitchen sink: "Find a model you like 
with drains at the back, not in the middle. That way, your garbage disposal and 
plumbing connections will be at the back and you'll have a lot more usable 
space under the sink." 
</P>
<P>
When we ordered the cabinets at the end of <DATE>October</DATE>, we had to decide whether to 
begin construction as soon as the cabinets were delivered or wait until after 
the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
The subcontractors said they could do the job in two or three weeks -- four at 
the most. Our designer said we'd be lucky to be back in the kitchen in less 
than six to eight weeks. We listened to her. It's a good thing we did, because 
demolition began on <DATE>Jan. 9 this year</DATE>, and we couldn't cook (let alone eat) in 
the kitchen again until <DATE>Feb. 20</DATE> -- six weeks to the day. 
</P>
<P>
One subcontractor caused the delay. In dealing with him, we made Mistake No. 3 
-- which was to pay him for work not yet done. We learned that we must never do 
that for any reason. A reputable, responsible contractor or subcontractor has 
established credit with suppliers and enough capital reserve to expect payment 
only when the work has been done in an acceptable manner. 
</P>
<P>
While the final work was being done on the kitchen, we began scheduling the 
last of the remodeling and decorating, including some additional electrical 
work, exterior and interior doors, entry tile, ceiling fans in the bedrooms, 
wallpapering, and painting. 
</P>
<P>
Each time one of these projects was delayed (and most of them were), it meant 
rescheduling the workmen who were to follow. 
</P>
<P>
But the work was finally finished nine months after it began, and the results 
have made every minute of frustration and difficulty worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
Our home has the bright, cheerful appearance we envisioned. The new kitchen is 
much more efficient and comfortable, with all-adjustable shelving, all base 
cabinets equipped with pull-out shelves or drawers, and a cabinet finish that 
is easily cleaned with cool water and a dry cloth. 
</P>
<P>
The entry is brighter and more welcoming, bedrooms appear larger and are easily 
cooled after a hot day, and the slightly imperfect flooring is easily 
maintained. 
</P>
<P>
We can enjoy the results of this odyssey until we're ready to retire and sell. 
Then, whether we build our retirement home or buy one that needs remodeling, 
the first person we'll contact is <LOCATION>Sandra</LOCATION>.

<HEAD>`Heartbeat' Is New Prime-Time Soap Set in Women's Clinic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Because shows such as ``Dynasty'' must tiptoe
around sex talk, <ORGANIZATION>Aaron Spelling Productions</ORGANIZATION> has set its new ABC
show ``Heartbeat'' in a women's clinic, where it can be right out
in the open, couched in the glow of healthy openness.
   Oh, please, ``St. Elsewhere,'' come back!
   Tonight's two-hour premiere features difficult childbirths,
artificial insemination and numerous gynecological exams. To start
off, there's an emergency birth that requires forceps and incisions.
   Oh, honey, bring in the potato chips!
   <PERSON>Kate Mulgrew</PERSON> plays hapless, overworked <PERSON>Dr. Joanne Springsteen</PERSON>,
who founded the clinic with <PERSON>Dr. Eve Autry</PERSON> (<PERSON>Laura Johnson</PERSON>, who is
married to <PERSON>Harry Hamlin</PERSON> of ``<LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION> Law''). Ben Masters plays <PERSON>Dr. Leo
Rosetti</PERSON>, a pediatrician and object of <PERSON>Joanne</PERSON>'s lust.
   <PERSON>Ray Baker</PERSON> is psychologist <PERSON>Stan Gorshalk</PERSON>, who counsels the
hospital's patients in matters psycho-sexual. In tonight's episode,
he confides to another doctor that he and his wife haven't had sex
in nine weeks. And the cobbler's children have no shoes.
   The show wants to offer up-to-date health information, like
tonight's debate over mastectomy vs. lumpectomy in cases of breast
cancer. Women's fears are unlikely to be assuaged by <ORGANIZATION>Gorshalk</ORGANIZATION>'s
argument that patient <PERSON>Wendy</PERSON> (<PERSON>Kathleen Wilhoite</PERSON>) should be
encouraged to face the fact that she very well might die. That
should have 'em flocking in for mammograms.
   Meanwhile, a couple who can't conceive are advised by the
leering ``fertility specialist'' (<PERSON>Darrell Larson</PERSON>) to go for
artificial insemination. After the procedure _ yes, we get to be
there _ the nurse practitioner (<PERSON>Gail Strickland</PERSON>) gently suggests
orgasm aids in successful implantation, and leaves the woman in a
darkened examination room alone.
   In between trying to hit the sheets with <PERSON>Leo</PERSON>, <PERSON>Joanne</PERSON> contends
with a friend who's pursuing a career and can't be bothered with an
``incompetent cervix,'' meaning the baby will be born prematurely
if she walks around too much. Joanne saves the day by borrowing a
newborn from the nursery to convince the expectant mom she should
stay in bed at least until the baby can be safely delivered after
the next commercial.
   Meanwhile, Eve confronts <PERSON>Wendy</PERSON>'s sexist family doctor, who
thinks <PERSON>Wendy</PERSON> ought to have a radical mastectomy instead of a
lumpectomy. What good is a breast, anyway, says the doc? It's
``just a piece of fat.'' Huffs glamorous Eve in her spandex dress,
``So are some of your body parts. Would you like to chop them off
and replace them with silly putty?''
   Some bad taste seems unintentional. Dr. <ORGANIZATION>Cory Banks</ORGANIZATION> (<PERSON>Lynn
Whitfield</PERSON>) is in a crisis because her husband is off on a building
job in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, causing her to remark, ``Sometimes I wish that whole
construction project would get swallowed up in an earthquake.''
   With any luck, ``Heartbeat'' will get swallowed up by bad
ratings.

   A photographer for Life magazine has just told actor <PERSON>Jeff Goldblum</PERSON> that he will be posing for a picture in a garbage can. 
The garbage cans set up for the shot are decorated with wilting lettuce and dead fish. 

   "I don't really want to get in the trash can," says <PERSON>Mr. Goldblum</PERSON>. 
"That means I'm garbage." 
His publicist, <PERSON>Mary Moen</PERSON>, adds, "I don't like the idea at all." 

   The photographer, <PERSON>Mark Sennet</PERSON>, doesn't miss a beat. 
"It's a great visual. 
Composition-wise it works. 
Otherwise we jeopardize the piece. 
But we'll try it both ways." (A Life editor has ordered the shot mainly as a reference to <PERSON>Mr. Goldblum</PERSON>'s movie "The Fly.") 

   After 40 minutes, <PERSON>Mr. Sennet</PERSON> has coaxed <PERSON>Mr. Goldblum</PERSON> to sit on the edge of the pail. 
"Lean in on that pail," he yells. 
"Great! 
Perfect! 
Now sit back as far as you can go." 
Within 10 minutes, <PERSON>Mr. Goldblum</PERSON> is seated firmly on the garbage in the can. 
"That's great!" cries the publicist. 

   Every week, a new array of unwitting subjects appear in magazine photographs in preposterous poses. 
It isn't enough to sit and look at the camera. 
The subjects appear leaping through the air while frying an egg, tossing their possessions in the air, or sitting in a bathtub full of soda or milk. 
"The idea is to make the magazine stand out," says <PERSON>Richard B. Stolley</PERSON>, the founding editor of People Weekly and a former managing editor of Life. 

   The shots may sell magazines, but why does anyone agree to get in these poses? 
The answer lies partly in the charm and chatty techniques used by photographers as they convince people it would be fun to, say, leap off a kitchen counter. 
"There's a tyranny to photographers that most people don't resist," says <PERSON>Anthony Frank</PERSON>, the chairman of <ORGANIZATION>First Nationwide Bank</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Indeed, the powerful often become putty in the hands of photographers. 
<PERSON>Malcom Forbes</PERSON>, the chairman and editor in chief of Forbes magazine, posed for the <DATE>July</DATE> issue of Vanity Fair by donning a pith helmet and sitting at a table on his yacht in front of a chocolate mousse with a burning sparkler in it. 
<PERSON>Mr. Forbes</PERSON> didn't want to wear the pith helmet, which the reporter provided. 
"I said, 'Aw, come on. 
I'll look ridiculous,'" he says. 

   But the reporter, <PERSON>Andre Leon Talley</PERSON>, persisted. 
"He said it will be fun," recalls <PERSON>Mr. Forbes</PERSON>, who concedes he was talked into the shot. 
"I was afraid I would wind up looking like a sap, but it didn't look too bad," he says. 
The quote next to the picture says, "Hope I don't look like <PERSON>Roosevelt</PERSON> in an Iroquois Indian headdress." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Forbes</PERSON>'s publication can also dish it out. 
A <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION> reporter told <PERSON>Richard Arendsee</PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION>Four Winds Enterprises</ORGANIZATION>, a moving and storage company based in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, to bring his hunting outfit for the photo session. 
"We get so tired of the constant pictures of people in business clothes," said the reporter, according to <PERSON>Mr. Arendsee</PERSON>. 
"I thought that's all I need, a picture like that in <LOCATION>Forbes</LOCATION>. 
I have a very strict dress code in the office," says <PERSON>Mr. Arendsee</PERSON>. 
He nevertheless did as told. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Arendsee</PERSON> began the photo session in a suit and tie in dignified poses in front of the office with his entire staff. 
After a couple of hundred shots, the photographer, <PERSON>Mr. Sennet</PERSON>, asked <PERSON>Mr. Arendsee</PERSON> to get in the hunting outfit and sit alone in a field with his shotgun. 
"I don't know, I just did it. 
I didn't for the life of me think that would be one of the pictures they would use," he says. 

   After the issue of Forbes appeared, with <PERSON>Mr. Arendsee</PERSON> in his hunting outfit, he received more than 100 comments, he says, many of them ribbing from his employees. 
"You with your dress code. 
Tell me more," was a typical comment. 
Says <PERSON>Mr. Arendsee</PERSON> with a sigh, "If I had my druthers, I would have chosen one where I had a coat and tie on." 

   Indeed, photographers often lull their subjects into a false sense of security by taking hundreds of shots of dignified poses while screaming "Great! 
Perfect!" and "Fabulous!" 
Then, they suggest a few leaps -- or an odd outfit. 
Explains <PERSON>Mr. Sennet</PERSON>, the photographer: "You do what they want and then hopefully you can do what you want. 
That's what separates a good photographer from a bad photographer." 

   The weird shot isn't always the one that appears in the magazine. 
<PERSON>Mr. Frank</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>First Nationwide Bank</ORGANIZATION> said a <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION> photographer had the "insane idea" that he should pose having his shoes shined. 
"I had my shoes shined for 22 minutes with a lot of lights. 
There was a great crowd watching," he says. 
However, the picture that appeared was of <PERSON>Mr. Frank</PERSON> seated on a stool in front of a window. 

   Efforts by the subject to take control of the situation rarely work. 
For the Forbes photograph, <PERSON>Mr. Frank</PERSON> suggested a picture with the name of his company in the background. 
"No," the photographer responded, "This is not a commercial." 
Most magazines won't let the subject determine which shot will be used. 

   <PERSON>Randy Miller</PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION>Original New York Seltzer</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Walnut</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, told a People photographer that he wanted to be photographed in front of a grocery-store display of his product. 
No go. 
The photographer, <PERSON>Mr. Sennet</PERSON>, told <PERSON>Mr. Miller</PERSON> he wanted him to drive along posh <ORGANIZATION>Rodeo Drive</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION> -- spraying pedestrians and cars with seltzer water. 

   "We sat there and talked, and I decided it was a bad idea," recalls <PERSON>Mr. Miller</PERSON>. 
"I was worried it would look silly." 
So <PERSON>Mr. Sennet</PERSON> told him they would do a lot of different shots but start out by spraying <ORGANIZATION>Rodeo Drive</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Miller</PERSON> wound up seated in the back of his old Mustang loaded with 200 seltzer bottles heading for <ORGANIZATION>Rodeo Drive</ORGANIZATION>. 
He sprayed the street and its pedestrians three times before the police came and told them to stop. 
"We never made it to the supermarket," says <PERSON>Mr. Miller</PERSON>. 

   There are, however, those who say no to the photographers. 
<PERSON>Martin Zweig</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> stock-market forecaster, refused to ride a live bull down Wall Street, according to <PERSON>Raeanne Rubenstein</PERSON>, a contributing photographer for People. 
"I thought it would be wonderful to have him galloping at top speed on the bull in a <ORGANIZATION>Brooks Brothers</ORGANIZATION> suit," says <PERSON>Ms. Rubenstein</PERSON>. 
"But he couldn't be convinced." 

   However, <PERSON>Mr. Zweig</PERSON> was amenable to posing beside a live bull -- on the condition that a bear also be present. 
The story was, after all, about his book, "Winning on Wall Street." 
But <PERSON>Ms. Rubenstein</PERSON> decided that could be a volatile combination. 
So she positioned <PERSON>Mr. Zweig</PERSON> between a live bull and a stuffed bear. 
In the published photograph, <PERSON>Mr. Zweig</PERSON>'s arms are raised, his fists are clenched and he is holding a copy of The Wall Street Journal. 

   "Every time the bull turned its head I was afraid the horn would hit me on the face, and the bull's nose was running," <PERSON>Mr. Zweig</PERSON> recalls. 
"On the whole, I would as soon not have done it." 

   Some draw the line at far more mundane requests. 
<PERSON>Tony Costa</PERSON>, a contributing photographer for People, says that actress <PERSON>Linda Evans</PERSON> once refused to be shown operating a vacuum cleaner. 
"We wanted her to do something pedestrian," he explains. 
<PERSON>Ms. Evans</PERSON> didn't respond to a request for an interview about the vacuum incident. 

   Some subjects ham it up on their own. 
<ORGANIZATION>New York Daily News</ORGANIZATION> columnist <PERSON>Jimmy Breslin</PERSON> told a People photographer that it would be "fabulous" to be photographed sitting on a bar stool in the street with an umbrella under the spray of an open fire hydrant -- while smoking a cigar. 
"I couldn't believe that was his idea," says <PERSON>Ms. Rubenstein</PERSON>, the photographer. 
The picture appeared in <DATE>June</DATE>. 

   But many subjects do as they are told and reflect later. 
Jameel Ahmad, a civil engineer in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, says he found himself being photographed by <PERSON>Ms. Rubenstein</PERSON> -- waist high in a pothole -- for a People story on his new adhesive for pothole repair. 
"She kept talking. 
We were laughing," he says. 
"Before I realized it, I was in the hole."

<LEADPARA>  Q My small dinette area is paneled in unfinished pine barnboard. The kitchen
wainscoting is also barnboard. I would like to stain it light, but the Early
American stain I tried on a scrap piece of wood is too dark. Can I dilute the
stain to make it lighter? How can I get a light stain? -- M.S., Millis, Mass.;
   A Thinning down the Early American stain, which is fairly dark brown in the
first place, may work, but it's a matter of experimenting, trying a diluted
stain first and then diluting it more to make it lighter if necessary.
Diluting the stain will not change the color but will change the intensity of
the color, so it's worth a try. But for a light stain, try a beige stain or
keep trying with other light-colored stains until you find what you like. To
keep the stained wood from getting dirty (a stained surface is difficult to
clean), apply one or two coats of a flat (if you can find it) or semigloss
urethane varnish. You could also try the varnish directly on the unstained
wood; varnished pine often comes out a yellowish color that you might or might
not like.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Q My finished basement floor got wet and the carpeting was soaked so badly
that I have to chuck it. I'd like to put down a vinyl tile, but a tile man
said that the peel-and-stick tiles won't work. Another tile man said that
industrial weight tiles with an adhesive would work. Now what? -- <LOCATION>C.R.</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Franklin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>;    A If the floor is rough, the peel-and-stick tiles won't
work because the thin tiles will follow the contours of the rough floor. If
the floor is very smooth, the peel-and-sticks should work. Heavy-duty tiles
put down with a waterproof adhesive will work well for a number of years. The
trouble with resilient tiles on a concrete floor is that water vapor comes up
through the concrete and tends to push the tiles right off. It might take
years before this happens.;    Q In my rented apartment, I suspect there is
some matchstick wainscoting in the kitchen behind some awful looking
wood-grain paneling. Can I take it off and paint the matchstick stuff if the
landlord approves? I think the paneling is nailed because I can see small
nails in the grooves. -- B. S., <LOCATION>Belmont</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>;    A You can, but there are
several caveats to consider before trying it. If the paneling is glued on (and
sometimes it is glued as well as nailed), it can be pried off, but you would
be hard put to scrape or sand off the glue that remains. So, if it is glued,
don't take if off. If it is nailed, you should be able to pry it off and, if
the matchstick panels are intact, paint them. To find out, pry back a little
paneling at the top edge; prying back should indicate that it is glued or
nailed. If it is glued, you can put the paneling back without making a mess.
Since it is applied over wood boards (the matchstick), I would guess it is
only nailed.;    Q I am stripping wallpaper from plaster. Is it necessary to
remove all the remaining glue before painting? -- <PERSON>D. M.</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Quincy</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>;    A
Yes. Wash the walls with Spic and Span and water. If the glue doesn't wash off
completely, it should be soft enough that you can scrape if off with a wide
putty knife. After washing and scraping, let dry, and sand glue residue with
fine sandpaper. Then paint with two coats of a latex wall paint.;    Q I had a
maple table stripped, and finished it on the top with polyurethane varnish.
Now, after some years, the solid top, 3 by 5 feet, is warping. It never did
this before. I put it on its back, and some of the warp went away. --<LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Lexington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>;    A Solid wood table tops tend to warp no matter what you
try to do, because they are solid, and when they dry out, they shrink, causing
the warp. The fact that just the top was varnished may be contributing to the
warp, although it is doubtful that the bottom was ever varnished. First, check
to make sure that the screws holding the top to the apron under the top are
holding properly. If they are not, tightening them might straighten out the
warp. Turn the table over and set it on its top (on a rug or other soft, flat
surface). Place buckets of water on the top to try to bend it in the opposite
direction of the warp. Leave for days or weeks. If you do this in the <DATE>winter</DATE>,
when the wood is dry, it might work. When the top is flat again, apply two
coats of high-gloss urethane varnish to the bottom.  </TEXT>

FT  27 NOV 93 / Minding Your Own Business: A repelling secret - Clive Fewins
meets Rufus Stone, soldier, sailor, policeman, engineer, surveyor, salesman
and potion mixer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rufus Stone is unlikely to forget the day he received an early-morning phone
call from a tea planter in <LOCATION>Assam</LOCATION>. Wild elephants were using the timbers
supporting his main tea-grading shed as scratching posts. One building had
already collapsed and his staff feared for their lives.
The caller had heard of a magic potion called Curb that would repel the
intruders if sprayed on the buildings. Could Rufus send some some urgently?
The carefully-contrived cocktail was urgently despatched, and proved
effective. The elephants went.
Stone's company, <ORGANIZATION>Sphere Laboratories</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>), has dealt with tigers in
<LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>, gerbils in Israeli desert settlements, pigeons in <LOCATION>Trafalgar
Square</LOCATION>, moles in parks and sports grounds, and, recently, football pitch
invasions for <ORGANIZATION>Tottenham Hotspur</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Queens Park Rangers</ORGANIZATION>. Both clubs'
newly-laid turf were being damaged by birds.
Lt <ORGANIZATION>Colonel Rufus Stone RE</ORGANIZATION> has done many things. He was born 81 years ago on
a farm in <DATE>mid-Devon</DATE> and has worked as a seaman, an inspector in the
Metropolitan Police and a regular soldier. During the war he worked on the
<LOCATION>Mulberry Harbour</LOCATION> off the coast of <LOCATION>Normandy</LOCATION> during and after the D-Day
landings in <DATE>1944</DATE>.
He has no formal training but has worked as an agricultural feedstuff
salesman, an engineering designer, a consulting engineer and a surveyor.
From 1959-63 he worked for the <ORGANIZATION>Cyanamid Corporation</ORGANIZATION> as UK general manager
and then as European director of the agricultural, foodstuffs and veterinary
division.
Soon after he was made redundant by Cyanamid at 51, a chance meeting in a
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> pub led to a request for him to tackle the problem of horses
*something in here (<ORGANIZATION>HP</ORGANIZATION>) *
chewing the woodwork in their stables at a racing stud.
'I had always been passionately fond of animals, but from my experience in
the veterinary and agro-pharmaceutical field I had also developed a pretty
good idea of what substances they found repellant,' said Stone, who runs the
one-man business from his 16th-century cottage in the village of <LOCATION>Chilton</LOCATION> on
the <LOCATION>Berkshire Downs</LOCATION>.
'I did a bit of ringing round and experimented with a substance I concocted,
based on aluminium ammonium sulphate. It was a powder mixed with water that
I painted on the looseboxes. After a bit of experimentation I managed to
find a formulation that worked.
'I had a hunch that I was on to something big, so in <DATE>1967</DATE> I took out
patents, and registered the main product under the name Curb.
'Then, without doing any formal marketing - all I did was some phoning round
 -I managed to interest a host of important people in the agricultural and
horticultural world. Some people in the field of domestic animal repellants
heard about Curb and were attracted by the powder form.
'I soon realised that Curb would stop pigs from tailbiting, birds from
pecking crops, dogs from fouling footpaths and rats from jumping on poultry
and killing their victims.'
Soon he was selling Curb to seed companies, local authorities, government
departments, and export agents.
'All sorts of big companies buy it from me and sell it under a variety of
fancy names. It also sells under different names in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION>,' Stone said.
The patents cost <ORGANIZATION>Stone Pounds</ORGANIZATION> 7,500 and covered 25 countries, but they
proved to be the wisest move he made.
'I raised Pounds 15,000 from a loan company - the only money I have ever
borrowed - to help me develop the enterprise at this important stage and you
could say the sphere was really rolling,' he said.
Sphere has been rolling productively - and profitably - ever since. Stone
can be seen at all hours mixing his secret potion in the 2,000 sq ft
industrial unit - a former wartime explosives and mixing store at <LOCATION>Milton
Park</LOCATION> near <LOCATION>Abingdon</LOCATION> that he has rented since <DATE>1970</DATE>.
'It is only four miles from my house so I just drive down and mix to order.
If there is a rush I have a few part-time helpers I can call upon.
'Annual production is about 50 tons and at Pounds 2,000 a ton that means I
turn over about Pounds 100,000. Profit runs at <MONEY>20-25 per cent</MONEY> of turnover
and my main overheads are materials at about Pounds 20,000 a year and my
annual rent, which is Pounds 12,000.'
But after 30 years of making and selling Curb doesn't he want to do
something new?
'I find it so interesting that I never want to retire. My father was playing
golf to a 16 handicap at 86, although I have given up riding and shooting I
should like to develop the company further,' Stone said.
'I find the calls I get and the problems to be solved immensely fascinating.
I have given papers at scientific meetings in the <ORGANIZATION>USA</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, and I meet
all sorts of interesting people on my troubleshooting trips in this country.
'A few months ago I had phone calls from <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Eire</ORGANIZATION> on the same day.
Both callers rang to tell me they had discovered Curb will stop birds
pecking putty out of window frames. Soon after the big putty manufacturers
got on to me. Now I sell to them, and so it goes on.'
There are two more things Stone wants to do. The first is to make his
stepsons, <PERSON>Sean and Simon</PERSON>, who he hopes will take over the business, fully
conversant with Curb's secret formula. The second is to develop neem oil, a
natural extract from <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>.
'The insect-repellant qualities of this substance have been known to mankind
since 500 years before <LOCATION>Christ</LOCATION>, but it has yet to be exploited to its full
potential,' he said.
'It will repel, and if necessary kill, just about every type of insect known
to man. The Americans are now growing it and say it is going to be very big
in harmless insect control over the next 100 years. Some experts say it has
a part to play in preventing the spread of HIV, while it can also be used to
repel organisms that cause barnacles to form on the outside of ships.
'I am keen for the British to exploit neem oil. All I need is to find
somebody with a few million to put into it.'

<DESCRIPT>  CHILDREN; BOOK; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  WHY would these distinguished children's authors get the idea that children
want to read about cleaning up?;   Perhaps it's good marketing. Children
seldom buy their own picture books. Order and cleanliness are adult
preoccupations. Would the children in Dr. Seuss's "The Cat in the Hat" have
been so concerned about the Cat's frolicking devastation if their mother were
not coming back? The messiness inherent in being a child and the adult desire
to keep it tidy account for much of the daily stress of family life. (I also
suspect that children's book illustrators love the prospect of illustrating
chaos.)  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  MESSING AROUND
THREE NEW PICTURE BOOKS FIND THE NEATEST STORIES
IN THE MOST DISMAYING DISORDER AND DISASTER  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Children's Books; Mackintosh is the author of "Thundering Sneakers" and
"Retreads," about life with three sons.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Of these three "mess" books, I think most children would pick "Fritz."
<PERSON>Rosemary Wells</PERSON>' plump animal characters with droll faces are always charmingly
dressed. I couldn't decide if Fritz and family are skunks or badgers. Never
mind. Fritz has the kind of room most children love. His favorite things are
Scotch-taped to the ceiling willy-nilly. The floor is littered with clothes,
toys, books, caps, ice-cream spoons stuck to dessert plates and an uneaten
peanut butter sandwich.;   On hearing the incessant parental litany, "Cleaned
up your room yet, <PERSON>Fritz</PERSON>?" Fritz agreeably shovels the stuff under his bed and
heads to the dinner table, where he endures his prissy sister <ORGANIZATION>Tiffany</ORGANIZATION>'s
superiority and taints his milk with pickle relish so he won't have to drink
it. After picking raisins out of his toast and stashing most of his potatoes
under his seat cushion, <PERSON>Fritz</PERSON> doesn't quibble about doing the dishes. He does,
however, get distracted by the need to select and assemble a last-minute
science project. Fritz selects one that requires a raw egg, a feather, copper
wire, rose-water glycerin (from <ORGANIZATION>Tiffany</ORGANIZATION>'s dressing table, natch) and a junior
rocket booster.;   <PERSON>Fritz</PERSON> is a single-minded scientist, oblivious to the dishes
he's left in the sink and the mess he's making. When confronted by all three
family members, he denies any responsibility, slams his bedroom door and
angrily punishes himself by throwing all of his trucks out the window into the
garden. He then falls into an exhausted sleep.;   The science experiment on
the floor beside his bed performs a once-in-a-lifetime chemical change,
producing a big pink Mess Fairy, a sort of Cat-in-the-Hat derivative who makes
<PERSON>Fritz</PERSON> look like a neatnik. Fritz watches in horror as the Mess Fairy snarls
extension cords, drinks lemonade from 23 glasses and mixes up board-game
pieces. He manages to banish her by reversing his rocket engine, but her
memory is so overwhelming that <PERSON>Fritz</PERSON> snuggles into the warmth and security of
his parents' bed. Oh, such cuddly, reassuring parents <PERSON>Wells</PERSON>' provides. "Did
you have a bad dream, my little carrot cake?" whispers the mother. "We love
you, Son," murmurs the father.;   Surrounded by such affection, <PERSON>Fritz</PERSON> is
suddenly ashamed of the mess he's left. He attacks the cluttered house with
resolve, and by dawn, "he feels good and clean and neat." Still euphoric about
his loving family, he determines to make them breakfasts in bed and, you
guessed it, cheerfully wrecks the kitchen while viewing himself as "the new
Fritz.";   <ORGANIZATION>Wells</ORGANIZATION> amuses children while offering wisdom to harried parents.
Children do not see clutter the way we do. The beads stuck in the clay are not
beads. They're berries. The sandwich under the bed may appease a dragon
lurking in the closet. Order is always temporary in childhood, perhaps
throughout life. Love must be forever.;   I have ambivalent feelings about
gorgeous, artistically exquisite, expensive picture books such as "Pish, Posh,
Said <PERSON>Hieronymous Bosch</PERSON>." On one hand, I favor exposing children to as much
visually stimulating color and line as possible. On the other hand, I thought
it was a pretentious ego-trip for parents when my own children studied
Michelangelo by lying on their backs painting under the nursery-school tables
a la the <ORGANIZATION>Sistine Chapel</ORGANIZATION>. I'm similarly unimpressed when a 4-year-old compares
her splatter painting to works of <PERSON>Jackson Pollock</PERSON>. Kindergartens should not
serve <ORGANIZATION>Perrier</ORGANIZATION> and Brie for snacks.;   Now comes <PERSON>Nancy Willard</PERSON>, who made
children conversant with <PERSON>William Blake</PERSON> ("A Visit to <PERSON>William Blake</PERSON>'s Inn")
<DATE>several years ago</DATE>, to introduce the wee ones to the 16th-century painter
<PERSON>Hieronymous Bosch</PERSON>, a fantasist known for painting mysteriously tormented
creatures often with vegetable or bestial parts where heads and arms should
be.;   <ORGANIZATION>Willard</ORGANIZATION> dedicates this book to "James and <PERSON>Julie</PERSON>," who I presume are
children. The illustrators -- the much-honored <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Diane Dillon</PERSON>, working
here with their son, Lee -- are cagier about their market. Their dedication is
"To wives and housekeepers and mothers everywhere." I wouldn't let a
runny-nosed, grubby-fisted kid anywhere near this creamy paper with the
three-shaded, hand-lettered text. The illustrations, according to the
copyright page, were under-painted in acrylics on acetate, over-painted with
oils, spot-; varnished and printed on 100-pound Natural Karma paper. The frame
on each page was sculpted and cast in silver, bronze and brass, then assembled
on a wood frame and photographed. Like a collectible bisque doll, this book
would remain on a high shelf to be brought down perhaps once a year for a
closely supervised look-see.;   Like the title, the text is satisfying end
rhyming. Bosch's housekeeper, a remarkably patient and tolerant woman, is
finally fed up with trying to bring order to the bizarre artist's household:; 
 "I'm quitting your service, I've had quite enough;   of your three-legged
thistles asleep in my wash,;   Of scrubbing the millstone you use for a dish,;
  and riding to shops on a; pickle-winged fish.";   "Pish, Posh,";   said
<PERSON>Hieronymus Bosch.</PERSON>;    The housekeeper thinks she'd much prefer the quiet
ordered life of working for nuns in a convent to "wrestling with dragons to
get to my sink / while the cats chase the cucumbers, slickity-slink." She
packs her suitcase and departs. While she sleeps, her suitcase yawns and
unleashes an eerie, yet affectionate assortment of stowaway Bosch-type
critters: a mole in a habit, a thistledown rabbit, a troop of jackdaws and a
three-legged dish. The text takes a dark turn as the housekeeper says:;   
They're not what I wished for. When women are young;   they want curly-haired
daughters and raven-haired sons.;   In this vale of tears we must take what
we're sent,;   <ORGANIZATION>Feathery</ORGANIZATION>, leathery, lovely, or bent.;    Resigned to her fate,
the housekeeper returns, and the childlike artist <PERSON>Bosch</PERSON>, with a colander on
his head, crows with delight. He greets her as his "Salvation" with great
affection and wacky promises of reform. Like most wives, mothers and all
housekeepers, we know it's only temporary.;   Despite the bizarre creatures
that populate each page, the Dillons have not drawn a nightmare-inducer. In
fact, their footed beehives and broom-bottomed mantises recalled a game that
once kept me entertained during interminable church services. My mother would
draw the head of some creature, fold the paper and invite me to draw any sort
of torso without knowing what sort of head she'd supplied. When I'd folded my
portion, another child in the pew might be invited to supply the legs and
another the feet. We were always delighted with the unfolding. Would it have
been any better if we could have exclaimed, "How Boschian!"?;   Messes made by
children and imaginative artists are fair game for children's books, but what
of the messes made by angry adults? In "Alpha and the Dirty Baby," Alpha, who
looks to be about 7, observes her parents swapping angry words and making
careless threats. The self-pitying, childish father says, "Oh, yes, they'd be
sorry if I joined the navy and got drowned." A devil's imp overhears and
transforms him into a lump of coal. The aloof mother remarks, "If that fool
does join the navy and gets drowned, I won't care." The imp's wife transforms
her into a green egg. The imps appropriate the parents' clothes and with putty
faces pretend to be Alpha's parents. If that weren't horrifying enough, they
thrust a filthy baby sister at Alpha with instructions to "Hug it! Kiss it!
Love it up!";   With the devilish imps in charge, <ORGANIZATION>Alpha</ORGANIZATION>'s life is totally
disordered. They are slobs who insist that the garbage be brought in, not out,
that beds be unmade, not made. The dirty baby tattles every time Alpha tries
to clean up. Lolling in their upstairs bed, the disheveled imp/parents hurl
threats at <LOCATION>Alpha</LOCATION>, "You'd better stop that, <LOCATION>Alpha</LOCATION>, or you're going to get it!";
  Soap and water to the rescue. Alpha triumphs by holding the dirty baby
hostage in the bathtub, which the imps won't touch for fear of getting their
hands clean. To retrieve their dirty baby, the imps agree to restore <ORGANIZATION>Alpha</ORGANIZATION>'s
parents, a feat achieved by tossing the lump of coal and the green egg in the
soapy bathwater. The imps depart and Alpha stands, arms folded, a world-weary
little girl; her parents embrace, still standing in the bathtub.;   The
watercolor illustrations are lovely; nobody creates a flurry of gorgeous
disarray better than <PERSON>Brock Cole</PERSON>, the author and illustrator of such charming
books as "The Giant's Toe" and "The King at the Door." This book, however, has
a story line as dark as his young-adult novels ("The Goats" and "Celine"). It
seems to exploit a child's worst fears: that one's parents' angry words will
cause a cataclysm, that parents might just disappear, that strangers who
resemble one's parents might assume their role, that a filthy baby intruder
might transform the whole family beyond recognition, and finally, that the
child herself or himself might have to assume the responsibility abdicated by
the adults.;   On the other hand, if this is just a story about the wonderful
powers of soap and water, I can think of better ways to get a kid to take a
bath. (box)  </TEXT>

   Why does a shade of dusky crimson in Benjamin Moore &amp;
Co.'s current paint catalog bear the name Segovia Red?
Because the World's Fair is drawing attention to Spain?
Absolutely. Because Spain produces hearty red wines? Yes.
Because Segovia is the name of Kenneth Charbonneau's wife?
Maybe that, too.
   After all, Mr. Charbonneau, paint-nomenclature manager at
the nation's fourth-largest paint maker, is entitled to take
a liberty now and again. He's responsible for all 2,000 hues
on the Montvale, N.J., company's palette, and most of them
must be renamed -- euphoniously, fashionably -- every six to
eight years. When he goes to the movies, watches television
or flips through a mail-order catalog, he is thinking about
the nation's mood and how it may be expressed in paint.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   He has to know when to stop selling Tequila Sunrise,
Yellow Submarine and <ORGANIZATION>Magic Dragon</ORGANIZATION> and start selling Mesquite,
<ORGANIZATION>Rainforest</ORGANIZATION> and Rolled Oats. Ivory sounded elegant and
romantic until the early '80s, when it suddenly suggested
dead elephants; renamed <ORGANIZATION>Oriental Silk</ORGANIZATION>, its sales jumped.
Tobacco <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> is still in the catalog, but <PERSON>Mr. Charbonneau</PERSON>
concedes "its name is a little unfortunate these days."
   <PERSON>Mr. Charbonneau</PERSON> worked as a painter and graphic designer
before joining <PERSON>Benjamin Moore</PERSON> in <DATE>1967</DATE> as an illustrator. For
the <DATE>past 19 years</DATE>, his title has been color and merchandising
manager. An animated 53-year-old, he lives in a house named
<LOCATION>Beau Geste</LOCATION> and oversees a staff of six color developers from
a corner office done in <LOCATION>Abingdon</LOCATION> Putty (light green, about
the color of a margarita).
   Right now, with international news in the air, he favors a
foreign flavor: <LOCATION>Majorca Peach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Bordeaux</LOCATION> Rose, <ORGANIZATION>Dresden Blue</ORGANIZATION>. A
new favorite is a deep magenta he christened <ORGANIZATION>Caravaggio Red</ORGANIZATION>.
"We could have called it <ORGANIZATION>Picasso Red</ORGANIZATION>, but that would have
been brighter, more vibrant, more shocking, a little more
orange," he says.
   With the World's Fair and the <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION> Olympics just over
the horizon, he's considering Toreador Red and <ORGANIZATION>Flamenco
Orange</ORGANIZATION>. For some reason, fruits and vegetables are on his
mind: Bitter Chocolate is now Raisin. And for the politically
minded, there's a <LOCATION>Kennebunkport Green</LOCATION>.
   Once in a while, a name just walks into his office --
literally. <PERSON>Mr. Charbonneau</PERSON> recalls: "I had all these colors
in front of me one day, and in walked a colleague wearing a
new grey-colored suit . . . and there it was." Grey Flannel.

<DESCRIPT>  CALIFORNIA; GOVERNOR; LEGISLATURE; FORECAST; BUDGET  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  California's largest tax increase and severe cuts in state spending could be
ready for final legislative approval by Friday, Gov. Pete Wilson and
legislative leaders announced Saturday after a closed-door budget summit.;   
Neither Wilson nor the top two leaders in the Assembly and Senate provided any
details about what fuels their optimism for resolving the $14.3 billion
deficit -- the biggest ever faced by any state -- by week's end.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Front  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  BUDGET ACCORD NEAR, WILSON, LEGISLATORS SAY
LARGEST TAX INCREASE, SHARP CUTS EXPECTED  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     However, it appeared that <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON>'s proposal to raise various taxes by <MONEY>$6.9
billion</MONEY> -- and no more -- remains intact in return for compromises on cuts he
proposed for education and welfare.;    Still on the table for discussion --
and a potential political powder keg -- is a plan to lay off 10,000 state
employees, according to today's edition of the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> Times.;    "I think
what finally hit is a pretty clear understanding of the dimensions of the
problems," said <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON>, the group's appointed spokesman. "We are going to have
to do some things that are very unpleasant in order to avoid essentially
shutting down state government.";    Sources familiar with <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s
bargaining session said <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON>, Assembly Speaker <PERSON>Willie Brown</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-San
Francisco</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> President Pro Tem <PERSON>David Roberti</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Los Angeles</LOCATION>, and Assembly
Republican Leader <PERSON>Ross Johnson</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Fullerton</LOCATION>, are now working from a sheet of
budget numbers crafted by <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON>Ken Maddy</PERSON>, R-Fresno.;   
And while budget intimates agree that the <PERSON>Maddy</PERSON> plan is still subject to major
revision, it provides the framework for face-saving compromise:;    (check) It
relies chiefly on <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON>'s plan to boost the state's <PERCENT>6 percent</PERCENT> sales tax to
<PERCENT>7.25 percent</PERCENT>, eliminating a week-old proposal to tax entertainment tickets and
end the interest deductions on second homes.;    Proposition 98;    (check) It
preserves the schools' funding formula -- outlined in voter-approved
Proposition 98 -- that sends <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> of general fund revenues to education.
<PERSON>Wilson</PERSON>, who wanted to cut education by <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY>, had called for Proposition
98's suspension. Democrats vowed to protect it.;    However, even if
Proposition 98 remains intact, schools still stand to lose about <MONEY>$1 billion.</MONEY>; 
  (check) The fledgling agreement would roughly halve <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON>'s plan to cut
welfare grants by <PERCENT>8.8 percent</PERCENT>, calling instead for a <PERCENT>4 percent</PERCENT> cut in Aid to
Families with Dependent Children.;    (check) <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> wanted to eliminate the
state's <MONEY>$38.5 million</MONEY> homeless assistance program. <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s plan would
preserve half its funding.;    "They are within hundreds of <MONEY>millions of
dollars</MONEY> of a deal," said one knowledgeable staffer, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.;    <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> and the leaders are to resume secret bargaining <DATE>Monday</DATE>
<TIME>morning</TIME>, and hope to announce a detailed agreement on the budget's substance
as early as <DATE>Monday</DATE> afternoon.;    "Our schedule is to bring to a vote -- a
final vote -- by next <DATE>Friday</DATE> the budget for the year <DATE>'91</DATE>-<DATE>'92</DATE>," <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> said
after his ninth secret meeting with legislative leaders.;    <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> said a
procedural vote needed to pave the way for final approval probably will take
place Wednesday.;    "The only thing I can tell you is that there is some hard
negotiating going on," the Republican governor said. "We are faced on both
sides with having to do some very unpleasant things. This has been described
as a budget that will contain something for everyone to hate. And that begins
to describe it.";    Because of a flagging economy and unprecedented demand
for state health, welfare, education and correctional services, <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON>
proposed in <DATE>April</DATE> his <MONEY>$6.9 billion</MONEY> bundle of taxes.;    Budget standoff;   
Assembly Republicans have balked at those increases. Democrats wanted more of
them -- and fewer cuts -- setting up a weeks-long budget standoff.;    <PERSON>Roberti</PERSON>
issued a statement that seemed to recognize the political difficulty of
winning agreement on a <MONEY>$55.7 billion</MONEY> budget in five days.;    "That's
certainly our goal," he said. "But it may be optimistic.";    Privately,
senior legislative aides were more skeptical and more blunt.;    "<PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> is
fond of setting deadlines -- artificial deadlines -- all along," said one
aide. "I think this is his way to set another deadline and jam it to the
legislative if they don't make it. There's a hell of a lot that is
undecided.";    <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> said there is urgency to the <ORGANIZATION>Legislature</ORGANIZATION>'s work because
he still believes there is time to get the sales tax in place by <DATE>July 1</DATE>.
Wilson's budget aides said <DATE>Friday</DATE> they already have written off the <MONEY>$350
million</MONEY> in sales tax revenue for that month because 30 days of lead time is
needed to get them on the books.;    "We are compelled to act to avoid making
what is now a <MONEY>$14 billion-plus</MONEY> hole even deeper," said <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON>, adding later:
"It's just not an acceptable situation.";    Clouding <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON>'s rosy
predictions for budgetary breakthrough is the 31-member <ORGANIZATION>Assembly GOP</ORGANIZATION> caucus,
which last week said it is solidly against <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON>'s tax plan. It unveiled a <MONEY>$4
billion</MONEY> spending reduction plan late last week that Democrats ridiculed as
"silly putty."  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  HOUSING; REPAIR  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  EXTERIOR house paint is now less toxic and less harmful to the environment
than it was. It is also easier to apply. But for paint to live up to
manufacturers' claims for durability and long life, surfaces to be painted
must be carefully prepared.;    Preparing outdoor surfaces for painting is
often the most difficult and tedious part of a painting project; it can also
pose a health hazard if the existing paint contains lead.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Peninsula Home  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  BRUSH UP ON EXTERIOR TREATMENTS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Home Improvement  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Here are methods for preparing exterior surfaces found on most houses.;   
(check) Unpainted wood needs only an undercoating of primer. Use the type
recommended on the label of the paint to be applied.;    (check) To prepare
painted wood, find out first whether the existing paint contains lead. The
federal government banned the use of lead-based paint in housing in <DATE>1978</DATE>, but
all houses with paint applied before <DATE>1980</DATE> should be considered at risk.;   
The only way to determine whether paint contains lead is to have the paint
tested. Local policies and services regarding lead testing vary; for
information, contact your state or local health department or a lead-poisoning
control center.;    If the paint contains lead, the wisest plan is to have the
surface professionally stripped by a contractor specializing in this.;    If
the paint does not contain lead, remove all loose particles with a scraper or
by sanding, and sand shiny but sound paint to roughen the surface so that new
paint will adhere tightly.;    Thick layers of paint should also be scraped
off.;    To soften these, use a heat gun resembling a hair dryer. Do not allow
paint to smolder, which can cause harmful fumes. Also avoid using a torch; its
open flame can start a fire.;    Excessive blistering or peeling, particularly
if it exposes bare wood, often is a signal that there are indoor condensation
problems.;    These can usually be cured by reducing the level of household
moisture, installing a vapor barrier of plastic sheeting or painting the
inside walls with special vapor-barrier paint and increasing ventilation by
using exhaust fans.;    After removing loose particles or if the paint is
sound, wash the surfaces to remove dirt and powdery paint residue. Both
prevent new paint from bonding tightly with old and as a result, the new paint
may fall off when the paint weathers a bit.;    Use household detergent mixed
with water according to the manufacturer's instructions. If surfaces have
mildew on them, add a cup of borax per gallon of water to the solution, or
separately apply a liquid mildew remover containing bleach.;    In both cases,
wear goggles and rubber gloves for protection. Rinse washed surfaces with
plain water.;    Drive all protruding nails below the surface. Then fill the
depressions with waterproof putty. Replace old or crumbling caulking.;   
Cover stains and areas of paint that remain powdery even after washing by
applying a stain-blocking primer-sealer. Cover other bare spots with whatever
primer is recommended for the paint to be applied. If the new paint will be a
significantly different color, consider priming the entire surface.;   
(check) Aluminum siding can be painted. To prepare it, wash and rinse as if it
were wood. If the existing paint is flaking, sand or brush the surface with a
wire brush before washing.;    (check) Vinyl siding, too, can be painted with
reasonable success provided the new color will not be significantly darker
than the original. (Heat from the sun can warp dark siding.);    To prepare
vinyl siding, simply wash and rinse. Sanding or brushing is unnecessary and
will scratch the siding.;    (check) To prepare unpainted concrete, brick and
stucco, or if paint on these materials is sound, scrub the surfaces with a
wire brush to remove loose particles, then rinse by spraying with a garden
hose. Allow it to dry completely before applying paint.;    If the cement in
masonry is less than six months old, it is necessary to apply an undercoating
with alkali-resistant primer before painting.;    To remove flaking paint from
concrete brick and stucco, use the same procedures as above but have the paint
tested for lead first.;    After removing the paint from surfaces in poor
condition, coat them with masonry conditioner. Some conditioners can be mixed
with paint.;    (check) Metal gutters and downspouts that may be coated with
lead paint should be tested and professionally stripped, if necessary.;    If
the paint is free of lead, these items can be prepared for new paint simply by
scouring their surfaces with a wire brush and applying rust-resistant primer.
Rust spots should be sanded down to bare metal or treated with rust converter
before primer is applied.;    Primer is not needed on galvanized metal that is
in good condition. But new, unpainted galvanized surfaces should be washed
with detergent to remove oils left on them from the galvanizing process.;   
Afterward, rinse the surfaces with water and allow them to dry before applying
paint.  </TEXT>

available from hardware and plumbing supply stores. If you follow the
instructions carefully (you may need to repeat the cleaning for the best
results), you should solve the noise problem.;    Once the tank is clean,
remove about a gallon of water from it each month to help keep the mineral
buildup to a minimum.;    Q What can I use to protect the wall above a
tub-shower combination? Paint doesn't last because of steam and poor
ventilation in the room.;    A Buy a Plaskolite "Easy Wall" Bathtub Wall Kit.
It contains flat plastic panels designed for use in tubs and showers. The
panels are glued to a clean, mold and mildew-free surface with a compatible
construction adhesive.;    If you're unable to locate the kit, write or call
<ORGANIZATION>Plaskolite Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <DATE>1770</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Joyce Ave.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> 43216, (614) 294-3281, for
the name of a supplier near you. You also should give serious thought to
improving the ventilation in the room.;    Q The surface of the concrete on my
porch is very slippery when wet. What's the best way to rough up concrete and
still have it look good?;    A You could use concrete etch, an acid available
from hardware stores. However, it can damage any adjacent painted surfaces.
Also, the treated concrete can sometimes appear uneven.;    I recommend that
you get bids from three companies that do on-site sandblasting. You will find
them listed in the Yellow Pages under "Sandblasting.";    Be sure that the
contractor is licensed and carries sufficient insurance to cover possible
damage to adjoining surfaces, windows, even nearby vehicles.;    Q My
fireplace and chimney were damaged during the <DATE>October 1989</DATE> earthquake. A
contractor built new ones, but I can't use the fireplace because smoke comes
into the room. The contractor added on to the chimney to no avail. Is there a
solution?;    A Assuming that the chimney was properly designed, that the
installer was a qualified brick mason, and that it was built to code with a
building permit and inspections, there are still several possible solutions.; 
  Check that the chimney flue is clear of debris. Install a chimney cap with
spark arrester to minimize downdrafts that can cause smoke to be blown into a
room. If these measures don't help, it's possible that the fireplace opening
is too large and will need to be reduced. If none of the corrections work,
consider installing a wood- or gas-burning fireplace insert.;    Q What can I
use to fill a small hole that was accidentally punched into the leg of a
table?;    A Wax base materials that resemble a child's crayon will fill nail
holes. An alternative is to use children's color crayons. Melt one or more
crayons to achieve the best color match, then let it cool. Cooling is
necessary so that the crayon is soft like putty and easier to handle.;   
Next, push the filler into the hole with a small stick. When the hole is
filled to slightly above the surrounding surface, shave the top even with the
side of a credit card. When smooth, apply two coats of a good-quality
furniture wax.;    Q What is the best glue to use when gluing raw wood to
<ORGANIZATION>Formica</ORGANIZATION> (plastic laminate)? I want to build some cabinets from sheets of
presswood that have the laminate already glued to two faces.;    A I doubt you
are working with sheets of presswood or particle board surfaced with a
high-pressure laminate such as <ORGANIZATION>Formica</ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION>Wilsonart</ORGANIZATION>. The surface is probably
covered with a low-pressure laminate or vinyl. Low-pressure laminate can be
glued with contact cement or epoxy. However, if vinyl, it may require a
special adhesive. You would need to have your lumber supplier get that
recommendation from the material's manufacturer.;    Check "European
Cabinetry: Design &amp; Construction," by <PERSON>Jim Christ</PERSON> (Sterling Publishing, <MONEY>$17.95</MONEY>)
for detailed information on cabinet construction.  </TEXT>
