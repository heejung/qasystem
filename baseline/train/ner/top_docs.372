   The 87 people who died in a social club fire
were martyrs to the quest for a better life, just like 146 people
killed exactly 79 years earlier in a fire in a city garment
factory, Mayor <PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON> said <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> told about 700 people at a memorial service for victims
of the <DATE>1911</DATE> fire at the <ORGANIZATION>Triangle Shirtwaist Co.</ORGANIZATION> that both tragedies
killed immigrants looking for improved living conditions in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>.
   ``With vicious irony yesterday, on the 79th anniversary of the
Triangle Shirtwaist fire, history repeated itself,'' the mayor said
at the site of the earlier blaze.
   On <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, the bodies of trapped revelers were found packed into
the <ORGANIZATION>Happy Land Social Club</ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>. A Cuban immigrant was
charged with setting fire to the club's only exit after he was
thrown out.
   Authorities said the club's patrons never had a chance to escape
the blaze because the building did not follow fire codes. It was
the same lack of concern for people that caused such devastation at
the Triangle factory in <LOCATION>Greenwich Village</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> said.
   ``So the lessons of the Triangle Shirtwaist fire are not
something we commemorate today, they are lessons that have been
driven home for us all to learn, once again,'' <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> said.
   ``Now, the martyrs of <DATE>March 25, 1911</DATE>, and the martyrs of <DATE>March
25, 1990</DATE>, are joined forever,'' he said. ``Like the victims at the
<ORGANIZATION>Happy Land Social Club</ORGANIZATION>, most of those who died on this killing
ground were immigrants to our shores.''
   ``They, too, came to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> to find a dream. Instead, they
found misery, exploitation and an agonizing death,'' he said.
``These 146 workers didn't have to die. Neither did the 87 people
in the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>.''
   Later, a fire truck ladder was raised up to the 10-story
building's sixth floor, the highest a fire ladder would go in those
days, as a fire bell was rung to mark the deaths. A wreath of white
roses was placed above pictures of the fire.
   ``They died at this building because they were seen as surplus
labor. They died because they didn't speak English very well,
because they weren't organized, because no one spoke up for them or
represented their interests and because their employer didn't care
about them,'' <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> said.
   ``In fact, that very day in <DATE>1911</DATE>, their boss went out late in
the <TIME>afternoon</TIME> and locked all the workers of the <ORGANIZATION>Triangle Shirtwaist
Co.</ORGANIZATION> inside, just to make sure none of them tried to leave early
while he did some shopping,'' he said.
   ``All 146 of them died painfully, horribly, just like the 87 who
died yesterday,'' the mayor added. ``And all of them died
unnecessarily, just like the 87 who died yesterday.''
   He recalled, though, that the workers' deaths inspired the labor
movement and brought about lasting changes in laws to protect
workers. Sweatshops have re-emerged in recent years and it is
necessary again to battle exploitation, <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> said.
   ``And again, there are those operating in the shadows, running
sweatshops and illegal social clubs and pursuing other schemes,
turning the lure and promise of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> into a nightmare for those
who seek to redeem the promise,'' he said.

   Inspectors this morning visited more than 200
social clubs in a crackdown ordered by Mayor <PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON>
following the deadliest city fire in 79 years. Only a fraction of
them were found to be open, but 52 safety violations were cited,
authorities said.
   ``I will tell you it will not be an endless battle,'' <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON>
said <DATE>Sunday</DATE> after touring the charred Happy Land social club in the
<LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>. ``Anybody that had an opportunity to view those 87 bodies
knows that we're not going to tolerate this.''
   Previous mayors have waged a long and unsuccessful battle to
close clubs that are operating illegally. The dancing and drinking
nightspots are popular among immigrants because they are cheap.
   A task force put together by then-Mayor <PERSON>Edward Koch</PERSON> after a <DATE>1988</DATE>
Bronx social club fire that killed seven people will be beefed up,
<PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> said. Before <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s fire, only one team remained from the
10-team task force.
   A sweep of social clubs was conducted between <TIME>midnight</TIME> and <TIME>7
a.m.</TIME>, police said.
   Officers and task force inspectors went to 241 suspected illegal
clubs citywide and posted vacate orders at 187 of them, said Sgt.
<PERSON>Dick Vreeland</PERSON>, a police spokesman. In most cases, the orders were
posted on closed doors, because just 23 of the clubs were found to
be open for business. Fifty-two safety violations and 30 summonses
were issued.
   During the sweep, five people were arrested for weapons
possession, 11 loaded firearms recovered, cars were towed and
parking tickets issued.
   <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, in raids unrelated to the fire, a police task
force raided several social clubs in <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> and arrested five
people for weapons possession, said Sgt. <PERSON>Tina Mohrmann</PERSON>, a police
spokeswoman.
   <PERSON>Albert Scardino</PERSON>, the mayor's press secretary, said police list
about 1,220 clubs without liquor licenses, with about 1,000
considered inactive. The Happy Land was considered inactive.
   ``They range from a group of elderly men who get together to
play cards and watch a ballgame on a <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> to
full-fledged nightclub operations,'' said <PERSON>Richard Chernela</PERSON>, a state
<ORGANIZATION>Liquor Authority</ORGANIZATION> spokesman.
   The number of clubs citywide is hard to pin down since they can
<DATE>spring</DATE> up overnight, often in a dank basement or abandoned building.
   A review of city records <DATE>Sunday</DATE> turned up 173 social clubs that
had been ordered vacated. Inspectors were told to make sure the 173
are closed. There was no immediate explanation of how other clubs
visited today were selected.
   If the illegal clubs are not shut immediately, <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> had said,
``we'll see to it that they certainly aren't open come the next
weekend.''
   <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s fire occurred 79 years to the day after a blaze at the
<ORGANIZATION>Triangle Shirtwaist Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> that claimed 145 lives,
many of them immigrant garment workers. That blaze led to reforms
around the nation in workplace safety.
   Just about anyone can go to a social club, despite the term's
implication of exclusivity. The Happy Land charged <MONEY>$5</MONEY> for admission.
   Despite periodic campaigns to close them, many of the clubs have
become centers of urban problems, from noise and double-parking to
gambling, prostitution and drug dealing.
   The clubs often are rife with building, health and fire code
violations that can lead to tragedy. Five people died in a <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION>
club fire in <DATE>1985</DATE>, and 25 people were killed in a <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> fire in
<DATE>1976</DATE>.
   ``People are literally taking their lives in their hands at
these clubs,'' <ORGANIZATION>Bronx Borough</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Fernando Ferrer</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> said a vacate order was issued in <DATE>November 1988</DATE> against
the Happy Land because the club did not have a proper sprinkler
system, exits, emergency lighting and signs.
   City records show an arrest was made there on <DATE>July 24</DATE> and the
club was closed again on <DATE>Nov. 1</DATE>, he said.
   City officials said the building was sold last year to <PERSON>Karl
Rubman</PERSON>, but <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> said it was unclear who owns the property now.
Residents said the manager of the club was <ORGANIZATION>Elias Colon</ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>Daily
News</ORGANIZATION> reported that <ORGANIZATION>Colon</ORGANIZATION>'s wife, <PERSON>Elena</PERSON>, was one of the survivors of
the fire.
   Some said it may be impossible to close the social clubs
completely.
   ``Our experience in the city in the <DATE>last 20 years</DATE> demonstrates
that clearly,'' said <PERSON>William Kornblum</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Center for
Social Research</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>City University of New York Graduate School</ORGANIZATION>.
   Many people, especially those from poor neighborhoods where
affordable alternatives are scarce, go to the clubs looking for a
place to socialize where they feel welcome.
   Some clubs are closed under the city's <DATE>1984</DATE> padlock law, which
allows police to shutter a location for a year if two crimes are
committed on the site within a 12-month period.
   But the owners, if they can be located, are rarely convicted.
   Even when the clubs are shuttered, an owner may reopen around
the corner or down the street, attracting the same crowd.

   A man bounced from a <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> social club for
quarreling with an ex-girlfriend returned with a jug of gasoline
and set a fire that killed 87 people at the nightspot, which had
been ordered closed, police said.
   <PERSON>Julio Gonzalez</PERSON>, 36, was charged with multiple counts of murder
and arson in the pre-dawn blaze <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at the Happy Land social
club, police Sgt. <PERSON>Edward Burns</PERSON> said.
   He appeared early this morning in <ORGANIZATION>Bronx County Criminal Court</ORGANIZATION>
and was ordered held without bail and placed in an isolated cell
under a suicide watch in a <LOCATION>Rikers Island</LOCATION> jail, <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> said.
   Meanwhile, authorities launched a crackdown on social clubs,
drinking and dancing nightspots that proliferate in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s poor
neighborhoods and often operate without proper licenses and safety
features. Happy Land was operating despite a <DATE>1988</DATE> closure order
that cited safety violations including improper exits.
   Most of the dead suffocated in thick smoke in the pre-dawn blaze
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>, authorities said. Some people were trampled to death;
others broke a hole through a wall to an adjoining hall in a
desperate attempt to escape.
   Emergency workers described bodies felled by smoke so quickly
that they still had their legs wrapped around a bar stool, gripped
drinks or held hands. Only three people managed to reach safety by
way of the two doors on the front of the two-story Happy Land
social club.
   ``People literallywere stacked on top of each other,'' said
<PERSON>Anthony De Vita</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Fire Department</ORGANIZATION>'s command chief. ``It was a
firetrap.''
   Gonzalez, a Cuban immigrant and former boyfriend of a Happy
Land's ticket seller, was thrown out of the club after a quarrel in
which he tried to woo back the woman, police said.
   After warning, ``I'll be back,'' he returned with a jug of
gasoline, sprinkled the fuel on the floor and lit it, said Lt.
<PERSON>James Malvey</PERSON>.
   Gonzalez cried with remorse under questioning, said Lt. <PERSON>Raymond
O'Donnell</PERSON>, a police spokesman. ``Basically, he's saying he did
it,'' <PERSON>O'Donnell</PERSON> said.
   Authorities early today inspected more than 200 social clubs
across the city, finding most of them closed. Vacate orders were
posted at 187 of them, and 52 safety violation notices were issued,
said Sgt. <PERSON>Dick Vreeland</PERSON>, a police spokesman. In addition, five
people were arrested for weapons possessions.
   On <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, officials had said a review of city records showed at
least 173 social clubs had been ordered to shut down in the past,
and Mayor <PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON> ordered officials to make sure they were
closed.
   It was the deadliest fire in the continental <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> since
the <DATE>1977</DATE> blaze at the <ORGANIZATION>Beverly Hills Supper Club</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Southgate</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky.</LOCATION>,
that killed 164 people. A New Year's Eve <DATE>1986</DATE> fire at a hotel in
<LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>, killed 97.
   The fire occurred exactly 79 years after a blaze at the <ORGANIZATION>Triangle
Shirtwaist Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>, a garment factory, that claimed
145 lives. That blaze led to reforms around the nation in workplace
safety.
   At a ceremony today marking the Triangle fire, <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> referred
to <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s club fire, noting that in both cases most of the
victims were immigrants. As in <DATE>1911</DATE>, he said, ``there are those
operating in the shadows, running sweatshops and illegal social
clubs and pursuing other schemes, turning the lure and promise of
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> into a nightmare for those who seek to redeem the
promise.'' The ceremony had been scheduled long before <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s
fire.
   After <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s fire, the impoverished Latino neighborhood near
the <LOCATION>Bronx Zoo</LOCATION> was thick with mourners, who were asked to identify
relatives from snapshots of the bodies posted on the wall of a high
school.
   Killed were 61 men and 26 women, most of them Honduran and
Dominican immigrants.
   ``Most of the bodies were in dance clothes,'' <ORGANIZATION>Emergency Medical
Services</ORGANIZATION> specialist <PERSON>Christopher McCarthy</PERSON> said. ``They were out to
have fun.''
   <PERSON>Alva Romero</PERSON>, a Honduran immigrant, lost six relatives, including
a daughter, both brothers and a sister. <PERSON>Jerome Ford</PERSON> lost five
relatives. The local Honduran soccer club lost several players.
   The government in <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION> today expressed regret over the fire.
Foreign Ministry spokesman <PERSON>Eugenio Castro</PERSON> said officials were
``deeply moved by the deaths of many countrymen in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.''
   Happy Land was ordered shut in <DATE>November 1988</DATE> and again a year
later because of inadequate exits, sprinkler systems, emergency
lighting and signs, <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> said. It had no liquor or cabaret
license.
   City officials said the building was sold last year to <PERSON>Karl
Rubman</PERSON>, but <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> said it was unclear who owns the property now.
Residents said the manager of the club was <ORGANIZATION>Elias Colon</ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>Daily
News</ORGANIZATION> reported that <ORGANIZATION>Colon</ORGANIZATION>'s wife, <PERSON>Elena</PERSON>, was one of the survivors of
the fire.
   Despite their name, the social clubs admit anyone. Happy Land
charged a <MONEY>$5</MONEY> admission price at the door; its illegally served
drinks cost about <MONEY>$3</MONEY> each.
   ``I will tell you it will not be an endless battle,'' the mayor
said in announcing the crackdown on illegal clubs. ``Anybody that
had an opportunity to view those 87 bodies knows that we're not
going to tolerate this.''
   Mayor <PERSON>Ed Koch</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON>' predecessor, made a similar promise
after a <DATE>1988</DATE> Bronx social club fire killed seven people. The clubs
are popular among poor immigrants.
   Two rickety staircases lead to the second-story dance floor
where most of the bodies were found. Disc jockey <PERSON>Ruben Valladares</PERSON>,
who spun reggae, salsa and calypso records, ran through the flames
and was hospitalized with severe burns.
   At least two other women escaped. Their condition was unknown.
   ``People were screaming; they were all burned,'' said <PERSON>Rosemary
Green</PERSON>, who found the club on fire when she arrived to meet her
sister-in-law and cousin. ``Once you got in the entrance there was
no way to get out.''
   Gonzalez, an unemployed warehouse worker, came to the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> on the Mariel boatlift in <DATE>1980</DATE>, <PERSON>O'Donnell</PERSON> said.
   Police said he went into the club about <TIME>3 a.m.</TIME> and began arguing
with the woman.
   ``He's trying to talk her into making up; she's saying `Leave me
alone,''' <PERSON>O'Donnell</PERSON> said. The man's ex-girlfriend left before the
fire, which was reported at <TIME>3:41 a.m.</TIME>, <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> said. Police withheld
her identity.
   <PERSON>Denise Garcia</PERSON>, 20, a filing clerk who lives in the neighborhood,
said she and her friends avoided the club because they considered
it ``too sleazy.'' The building was rickety and the dance floor
sometimes trembled, she said.
   One firefighter broke a leg; 13 of his colleagues also were
injured.
   Gonzalez was charged with two counts of arson, 87 counts of
murder in the course of arson, 87 counts of murder by depraved
indifference to human life and one count of attempted murder.

   Hundreds of dangerous and illegal social clubs
thrive in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> despite efforts to close them, because people in
poor neighborhoods have few alternatives for entertainment,
officials say.
   ``People are literally taking their lives in their hands at
these clubs,'' <ORGANIZATION>Bronx Borough</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Fernando Ferrer</PERSON> said after a
fire <DATE>Sunday</DATE> killed 87 people at the Happy Land social club.
   It was the city's deadliest blaze since 145 people were killed
in a fire at a garment factory, the <ORGANIZATION>Triangle Shirtwaist Co.</ORGANIZATION> of
<LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>, 79 years ago to the day.
   Authorities said most of the predawn revelers were trapped on a
second-story dance floor and died from smoke inhalation. The
building lacked proper exits and other safeguards.
   The 4-year-old club, which didn't have a liquor or cabaret
license, was shut down for the second time <DATE>Nov. 1, 1989</DATE>, by the
city <ORGANIZATION>Buildings Department</ORGANIZATION>, but reopened illegally, Mayor <PERSON>David
Dinkins</PERSON> said.
   Despite periodic campaigns to close them, social clubs have been
centers of urban problems ranging from noise and double-parking to
gambling, drug dealing and prostitution.
   Mayor <PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON> estimated there are at least 700 social
clubs in the city.
   They often are rife with building, health and fire code
violations that can lead to tragedy. Six people died in a <DATE>1988</DATE> fire
at a <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> club, five in a <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> club fire in <DATE>1985</DATE>, and 25
people were killed in another <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> fire in <DATE>1976</DATE>.
   ``I don't know what it's going to take _ an army _ to stop them
from going to places like this,'' said newly elected <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON>Jose
Serrano</PERSON> after visiting the scene <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   City records reviewed <DATE>Sunday</DATE> showed 173 social clubs had been
given orders to vacate, <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> said at an <TIME>afternoon</TIME> news
conference.
   ``Tonight, we will commence to check those places, see that
they're in fact closed,'' he said. ``We'll see to it that they
certainly aren't open come the next weekend.''
   Just about anyone can go to a social club, despite the term's
implication of exclusivity. An employee usually keeps an eye on the
door, but a club member is generally anyone who walks in on a given
night.
   ``They range from a group of elderly men who get together to
play cards and watch a ballgame on a <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> to
full-fledged nightclub operations,'' said <PERSON>Richard Chernela</PERSON>, a state
<ORGANIZATION>Liquor Authority</ORGANIZATION> spokesman.
   <ORGANIZATION>New York State</ORGANIZATION> liquor licenses cost up to <MONEY>$5,100</MONEY> and are good
for three years. But many club operators don't apply for one,
sometimes because they or potential employees may have criminal
records that would disqualify them.
   While the city's licensed bars are required to close by <TIME>4 a.m.</TIME>,
social clubs often stay open until dawn or later, usually to the
distress of nearby residents. Neighborhood residents said <ORGANIZATION>Happy
Land</ORGANIZATION> stayed open until <TIME>6 a.m.</TIME>
   Often there's a cover charge _ <MONEY>$5</MONEY> at Happy Land. Often the clubs
sell drinks.
   Many who go to the clubs are looking for a place to socialize
that they can afford and where they feel welcome. But they also
attract a criminal element.
   A state task force reported several years ago that alcohol
consumption is often of secondary importance.
   ``The primary function of these operations has developed into
prostitution, gambling, drugs and trafficking in stolen property,''
it said.
   Just <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, a police task force in <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> raided
several social clubs and arrested five people for weapons
possession, said Sgt. <PERSON>Tina Mohrmann</PERSON>, a police spokeswoman.
   Some clubs are closed under the city's ``padlock law,'' which
allows police to shutter a location for a year if two crimes are
committed on the site within a 12-month period.
   But the owners _ if they can be found _ are rarely convicted.
Defendants arrested in police raids often end up pleading guilty to
a lesser charge, which then doesn't qualify as a criminal
conviction under the padlock law.
   Even when the clubs are shuttered, the owners often open up
again around the corner or down the street, attracting the same
crowd.
   Then-Mayor <PERSON>Edward Koch</PERSON> put together an interagency task force
after the <DATE>1988</DATE> fire sparked a public outcry about the dangers of
social clubs.
   ``The ironic thing is that all the legislation is on the
books,'' said <PERSON>Clint Roswell</PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON>Ferrer</PERSON>. ``It's just
(an) enforcement problem.''

   The man accused of setting fire to the Happy
Land social club was arraigned <DATE>Monday</DATE> on charges of murdering 87
people, and police said he told them ``the devil got into me.''
   Authorities began shutting other illegal clubs in response to
<LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>'s worst fire in 79 years.
   The families of the 87 victims, most of whom were Honduran or
Dominican immigrants, sought solace in their grief, and a
government task force was set up to counsel them and help make
funeral arrangements.
   <PERSON>Julio Gonzalez</PERSON>, 36, was accused of setting the fire early <DATE>Sunday</DATE>
with <MONEY>$1</MONEY> worth of gasoline after arguing with a former girlfriend
who worked at the illegal club. He is said to have threatened to
``shut this place down.''
   ``I got angry, the devil got into me, and I set the place on
fire,'' <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> told authorities, according to a police source who
spoke to <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> on condition of anonymity.
   During a hearing at <ORGANIZATION>Bronx County Criminal Court</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> was
charged with 87 counts of murder committed during the course of
arson; 87 counts of murder by depraved indifference to human life;
one count of attempted murder; and two counts of arson.
   The case was turned over to a grand jury, and <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> will not
be asked to enter a plea unless an indictment is issued. He was
held under a suicide watch at the <LOCATION>Rikers Island</LOCATION> jail and later
admitted to <ORGANIZATION>Kings County Hospital Psychiatric Ward</ORGANIZATION>, where he will
be held indefinitely, said <PERSON>Ruby Ryles</PERSON>, a city jails spokeswoman.
   The deaths were believed to be the most ever charged to a single
suspect in the continental <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   ``He is a double animal,'' said <PERSON>Rene J. Mena</PERSON>, 63, whose son,
<PERSON>Rene Jr.</PERSON>, 30, died. ``Here, they're going to have good food for
him, a book, a movie. In <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION>, we don't do it that way.''
   District Attorney <PERSON>Robert T. Johnson</PERSON> said he hoped that if
<PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> is convicted, he would get consecutive prison sentences
amounting to 2,000 years.
   An equally angry Mayor <PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON> ordered a sweep of other
suspected unlicensed social clubs. Police and a special task force
visited 241 clubs citywide from midnight to <TIME>7 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Monday</DATE> and
posted vacate orders on 187.
   Only 23 of the clubs were open _ most are closed on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>
nights. There were 52 safety violations and 30 summonses issued,
said Sgt. <PERSON>Dick Vreeland</PERSON>, a police spokesman.
   In the <LOCATION>East Tremont</LOCATION> section of the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>, families drifted in
and out of Public School 67, across from the fire-blackened club. A
task force of state, city and private agencies there helped them
make funeral arrangements and offered counseling and financial
assistance.
   ``It's orderly, but it's not emotionally orderly,'' said <PERSON>Ken
Curtin</PERSON>, a local <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> disaster relief director. ``It's highly
charged. There are a lot of outbursts of grief.''
   In <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>, a foreign ministry spokesman said the government
``is deeply moved by the deaths of many countrymen in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.''
The Honduran telephone company said it was swamped with calls from
people seeking word about loved ones.
   The fire broke out at <TIME>3:40 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, and those inside the
club suffocated, burned or were trampled to death in a matter of
minutes.
   They had to ``choose between a wall of fire or retreating and
dying of asphyxiation,'' <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   Police believe five people escaped from the fire: three patrons;
<PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON>'s former girlfriend, <PERSON>Lydia Feliciano</PERSON>; and the club disc
jockey.
   The disc jockey, identified in published reports as <PERSON>Ruben
Valladares</PERSON>, was listed as stable at <ORGANIZATION>Jacobi Hospital</ORGANIZATION> with burns over
<PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> of his body, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON>Vicki Ciampa</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Ms. Feliciano</PERSON> and the others, whose names were withheld, escaped
serious injury. <PERSON>Ms. Feliciano</PERSON> is in protective custody.
   <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> had been ejected from the club after
arguing with <PERSON>Ms. Feliciano</PERSON> and threatening to ``shut this place
down.''
   He allegedly bought <MONEY>$1</MONEY> worth of gasoline at a nearby service
station, then returned and faked making a telephone call when he
saw a possible witness. When that person left, he allegedly poured
gasoline between the street and an inside door of the club and
ignited it.
   After that, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said, he watched it burn for a while, making
statements to at least two witnesses about his role in the fire. He
then went home, where police found him a few hours later. He made a
videotaped admission to police, authorities said.
   <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> knew the two-story club lacked windows,
rear exits and adequate staircases. He also knew how crowded it
was, authorities said.
   Gonzalez, who came to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> on the <DATE>1980</DATE>
Mariel boatlift, had no arrest record here, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said he has the name of a possible club owner, but will
not release it until it's confirmed. A vacate order was issued in
<DATE>November 1988</DATE> and again a year later because Happy Land lacked a
proper sprinkler system, exits, emergency lighting and signs. It
also had no liquor or cabaret license, the mayor said.
   The fire struck on the 79th anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION>Triangle
Shirtwaist Co.</ORGANIZATION> fire. That <DATE>1911</DATE> tragedy claimed 146 lives, many of
them immigrant garment workers, leading to nationwide reforms in
workplace safety.
   Dinkins discussed night club tragedy while addressing 700
garment workers and other union members who gathered <DATE>Monday</DATE> in
<LOCATION>Lower Manhattan</LOCATION> to commemorate the Triangle fire.
   ``They came to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> in search of a better life. Early
yesterday morning their American dream became a fatal nightmare,''
said <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON>, who inspected the scene of <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s fire.
   ``The sight of those bodies, lined along the walls like so many
wax figures, and the realization of the panic and the pain they
must have suffered in their last moments, will remain with me for
the rest of my life,'' said <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON>. ``Most horrifying is that this
should never have happened.''
   Roman Catholic Cardinal <PERSON>John J. O'Connor</PERSON> officiated at an
hour-long, English and Spanish prayer service outside the club on
<DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>. A thousand mourners began the service by walking
a few blocks from <PERSON>St. Thomas Aquinas</PERSON> church, the parish of many of
the victims.
   ``We pray for those who died,'' said <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON>. ``We pray in a
special way for those who survived. We need to pray for the dead
and for the survivors. ... Our best is never good enough in
circumstances of this sort.''

   Prosecutors are investigating whether owners in
a corporate chain that includes the husband of actress <PERSON>Kathleen
Turner</PERSON> may share responsibility in the fire deaths of 87 people in
an illegal nightclub.
   The Cuban immigrant accused of torching the club to avenge a
romantic snub was under a suicide watch in a psychiatric ward today
after allegedly telling police he set the blaze because ``the devil
got into me.''
   <PERSON>Julio Gonzalez</PERSON>, 36, was charged with murdering 87 people by
setting fire <DATE>Sunday</DATE> to the jammed Happy Land social club in the
<LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>.
   Miss <ORGANIZATION>Turner</ORGANIZATION>'s husband, <PERSON>Jay Weiss</PERSON>, acknowledged through a
statement by his lawyer that he and a partner are principals of
<ORGANIZATION>Little Peach Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which leased the club site in <DATE>1985</DATE> from a
corporation controlled by real estate developer <PERSON>Alex DiLorenzo III</PERSON>.
Two years later Little Peach sublet the two-story building to <PERSON>Elias
Colon</PERSON>, who operated the Happy Land club.
   Colon died in the fire.
   The statement by the lawyer, <PERSON>Roger Boyle</PERSON>, said <PERSON>Weiss</PERSON>' company
``has been actively pressing eviction proceedings against <PERSON>Mr. Colon</PERSON>
and had hoped that a final eviction would have resulted from a
trial scheduled for <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> of this week.''
   The statement said <PERSON>Weiss</PERSON> and his partner, <PERSON>Morris Jaffe</PERSON>, ``are
horrified at the events of this <DATE>weekend</DATE> and lament the loss of life
which ensued.''
   Bronx District Attorney <PERSON>Robert Johnson</PERSON> has said he has 10
assistants working on prosecuting <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> and also ``working on
the investigation of whether or not there is any possible
responsibility, criminal liability, on the part of the club and-or
the owner of the building.''
   Across from the fire-blackened club in an impoverished
neighborhood near the <LOCATION>Bronx Zoo</LOCATION>, families on <DATE>Monday</DATE> drifted in and
out of Public School 67, where agencies helped arrange funerals and
offered counseling and financial aid.
   Anger was directed at <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON>' former girlfriend, <PERSON>Lydia
Feliciano</PERSON>, when she appeared at the school to inquire about aid for
friends.
   ``I can't believe she is here. How could she show her face?''
said <PERSON>Edgardo Rodriguez</PERSON>, 22, who lost four friends and was awaiting
information on financial aid to send their bodies home to <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>.
   When asked why she came to the school, <PERSON>Ms. Feliciano</PERSON> responded,
``I lost people too. I lost friends.'' As a crowd gathered around
her, two police officers escorted <PERSON>Ms. Feliciano</PERSON> out of a back
entrance of the school.
   A huge wooden cross stood in front of the nightclub's ruins as
neighbors prayed at an outdoor service conducted in English and
Spanish. The service <DATE>Monday</DATE> ended with the singing of ``De
Colores,'' a song about brotherly love.
   At the direction of Mayor <PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON>, authorities visited 241
clubs citywide from midnight to <TIME>7 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Monday</DATE> and posted orders on
187 of them to vacate.
   Police issued 52 safety violations and 30 summonses, said Sgt.
<PERSON>Dick Vreeland</PERSON>.
   Police said <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> had vowed to ``shut this place down'' after
an argument with <PERSON>Ms. Feliciano</PERSON>, a Happy Land employee who had split
with the unemployed <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> several months ago.
   ``I got angry, the devil got into me, and I set the place on
fire,'' <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> told authorities, according to a police source who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Gonzalez was arraigned on 87 counts of murder committed in the
course of arson; 87 counts of murder by depraved indifference to
human life; one count of attempted murder, and two counts of arson.
He entered no plea.
   Johnson, the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> district attorney, said he hoped <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON>
would get consecutive sentences amounting to 2,000 years in prison
if convicted.
   Gonzalez, who was jailed for army desertion in <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> in the
<DATE>1970s</DATE>, came to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> on the <DATE>1980</DATE> Mariel
boatlift. He told immigration officials he had portrayed himself as
a drug trafficker to get kicked out of <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>, The <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION>
reported.
   The victims of <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s fire, many of them Honduran immigrants,
suffocated, burned or were trampled to death. They had to ``choose
between a wall of fire or retreating and dying of asphyxiation,''
<PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   Police believe five people escaped: three patrons; <PERSON>Ms.
Feliciano</PERSON>, and the club disc jockey, <PERSON>Ruben Valladares</PERSON>.
   Valladares was listed in critical but stable condition today at
<ORGANIZATION>Jacobi Hospital</ORGANIZATION> with burns over <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> of his body. <PERSON>Ms.
Feliciano</PERSON> and the others escaped serious injury. <PERSON>Ms. Feliciano</PERSON> is
in protective custody.
   <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> had described the following sequence:
   After arguing with <PERSON>Ms. Feliciano</PERSON>, with whom he sought to resume
a relationship, he was ejected from the club.
   He bought <MONEY>$1</MONEY> worth of gasoline at a nearby station, returned and
faked making a telephone call when he saw someone. When that person
left, he poured gasoline between the street and an inside door and
ignited it.
   Gonzalez watched it burn for awhile, making statements to at
least two witnesses about his role in the fire. Then he went home,
where police found him a few hours later, his shoes reeking of
gasoline. He made a videotaped admission to police.
   <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> knew the two-story club lacked windows,
rear exits and adequate staircases. He also knew how crowded it was.
   ``He is a double animal,'' said <PERSON>Rene J. Mena</PERSON>, whose son, <PERSON>Rene
Jr.</PERSON>, 30, died in the fire. ``Here, they're going to have good food
for him, a book, a movie. In <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION>, we don't do it that
way.''
   A vacate order was issued in <DATE>1988</DATE> against the club and again a
year later because Happy Land lacked a proper sprinkler system,
exits, emergency lighting and signs. It also had no liquor or
cabaret license, <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> said.
   Dinkins discussed <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s tragedy while addressing garment
workers <DATE>Monday</DATE> commemorating <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Triangle Shirtwaist
Co.</ORGANIZATION> fire, which occurred exactly 79 years before the Happy Land
blaze. The <DATE>1911</DATE> tragedy claimed 146 lives and transformed workplace
safety laws around the country.
   ``The sight of those bodies, lined along the walls like so many
wax figures, and the realization of the panic and the pain they
must have suffered in their last moments, will remain with me for
the rest of my life,'' <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> said.

   Fire raced through an illegal social club early
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> and turned a packed dance floor into a deathtrap of smoke
and flame that killed 87. A man who allegedly had earlier fought
with a club worker was charged with arson and murder.
   The fire, the nation's worst in 13 years, tore through the Happy
Land club, which authorities said lacked proper exits and other
safeguards.
   The <TIME>3:40 a.m.</TIME> fire killed 61 men and 26 women, most of them
Honduran and Dominican immigrants. Most were found on the second
floor.
   ``People literally were stacked on top of each other,'' said
<PERSON>Anthony De Vita</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Fire Department</ORGANIZATION>'s command chief. ``It was a
firetrap,'' he said of the two-story building in an impoverished
neighborhood near the <LOCATION>Bronx Zoo</LOCATION>.
   Some of the victims broke a hole through a wall to an adjoining
hall in a desperate attempt to save their lives, said <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION>
worker <PERSON>Margaret Glugover</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Julio Gonzalez</PERSON>, 36, was charged with arson and murder in the
case, said Lt. <PERSON>Raymond O'Donnell</PERSON>, a police spokesman. The district
attorney's office later would determine how many counts Gonzalez
would be charged.
   ``We believe the motive in this case was the result of a dispute
he had with a female employee of the club,'' Police Commissioner
<PERSON>Lee Brown</PERSON> said at a <ORGANIZATION>City Hall</ORGANIZATION> news conference <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>.
   Gonzalez emigrated in <DATE>1980</DATE> from <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> during the Mariel boatlift
that brought 125,000 Cubans to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   Police said <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> went into the club about <TIME>3 a.m.</TIME> and began
arguing with his former girlfriend, who sold tickets near the
entrance.
   ``He's trying to talk her into making up, she's saying `Leave me
alone,''' <PERSON>O'Donnell</PERSON> said.
   A club bouncer evicted the man half an hour later, and police
alleged he returned and started the fire near the entrance.
   The woman employee left before the fire, <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> said.
   At least two women and one man, believed to be the club's disc
jockey, escaped. The man was seriously burned; the condition of the
women was unknown.
   Most of the dead were believed to have suffocated from the thick
smoke, which billowed hundreds of feet, but some were trampled,
said <PERSON>Lynn Schulman</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>Emergency Medical Service</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman.
   ``This is the worst thing I have seen in my career,'' said
<ORGANIZATION>Emergency Medical Services</ORGANIZATION> specialist <PERSON>Christopher McCarthy</PERSON>. ``It
hurt my stomach. It was sickening.''
   ``Most of the bodies were in dance clothes,'' <PERSON>McCarthy</PERSON> said.
``They were out to have fun. ... I saw wall-to-wall bodies _ an
indication of mass confusion and panic.''
   The fire was the deadliest in the continental <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>
since a <DATE>May 28, 1977</DATE>, blaze at the <ORGANIZATION>Beverly Hills Supper Club</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Southgate</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky.</LOCATION>, that killed 164 people. A <DATE>Dec. 31, 1986</DATE>, fire at a
hotel in <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> commonwealth, killed 96
people.
   The tragedy occurred in <LOCATION>East Tremont</LOCATION>, a section of the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>
borough. Deputy Mayor <PERSON>Bill Lynch</PERSON> described it as an ``economically
disadvantaged, working-class, Latino neighborhood.''
   The building housed a group that organized children's baseball
as well as adult social events, said <PERSON>Lillian Rivera</PERSON>, a neighbor.
   A makeshift morgue was set up at a hall next door. Authorities
took <ORGANIZATION>Polaroid</ORGANIZATION> pictures of the bodies and showed them to 200 friends
and relatives at a school across the street where the cries and
wails of relatives could be heard outside. Then, the bodies were
moved to a hospital morgue.
   After viewing the bodies, Mayor <PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON> called the scene
``graphic and sad.''
   <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> said a vacate order was issued in <DATE>November 1988</DATE> because
the club lacked a proper sprinkler system, exits, emergency
lighting and signs.
   City records show the club was again ordered closed on <DATE>Nov. 1,
1989</DATE>, by the <ORGANIZATION>Buildings Department</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> said.
   ``I don't know what subsequent visits were made there,'' the
mayor said.
   The club had no liquor or cabaret license.
   Two neighborhood residents said three gunshots were heard just
before the fire. <PERSON>Robert Ungar</PERSON>, deputy fire commissioner, said he
could not confirm another report that cans of accelerant were found.
   So-called ``social clubs'' proliferate in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>'s poor
neighborhoods, and despite their name many of them admit virtually
anyone who wants to enter, functioning essentially as unlicensed
taverns or dance clubs.
   <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> police officials have estimated that alcohol is sold
without a license at more than 200 locations.
   Authorities said the victims tried to escape the windowless club
down a stairway just wide enough for one person. A second stairway
apparently wasn't used, perhaps because it couldn't be reached from
the club.
   Sixty-nine of the victims died upstairs, where the dance floor
was located.
   ``People were screaming; they were all burned,'' said <PERSON>Rosemary
Green</PERSON>, who found the club on fire when she arrived to meet her
sister-in-law and cousin. ``Once you got in the entrance there was
no way to get out.''
   <PERSON>Denise Garcia</PERSON>, 20, a filing clerk who lives in the neighborhood,
said she and her friends avoided the club because they considered
it ``too sleazy.'' The building was rickety and the dance floor
sometimes trembled, she said.
   <PERSON>Ms. Garcia</PERSON> said the club's patrons included many illegal
immigrants.
   The tragedy occurred on the 79th anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION>Triangle
Shirtwaist Co.</ORGANIZATION> fire in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>, which killed 145 people, most of
them immigrant garment workers, and led to reforms governing
workplace safety.
   EMS Lt. <PERSON>Roy David</PERSON> said he got to the scene just as the male
survivor was staggering out.
   ``He walked toward me. He couldn't talk. He couldn't say
anything. All we could do was treat him,'' <PERSON>David</PERSON> said.
   Five firefighters, including a battalion chief who broke his
leg, were taken to <LOCATION>Jacobi</LOCATION> after inhaling smoke. Six other
firefighters were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation.

   A suspicious fire swept through a jam-packed,
illegal social club for Latin immigrants in the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> early <DATE>Sunday</DATE>,
killing at least 87 people, fire officials said.
   The fire, the worst in the continental <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in 13
years, was reported at the <ORGANIZATION>Happy Land Social Club</ORGANIZATION> near the <LOCATION>Bronx
Zoo</LOCATION> at <TIME>3:41 a.m.</TIME> and quickly spread through the two-story brick
building. Authorities and witnesses said the panic-stricken victims
were trapped and only one man apparently managed to escape,
severely burned.
   ``This is the worst thing I have seen in my career. It hurt my
stomach. It was sickening,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Emergency Medical Services</ORGANIZATION>
specialist <PERSON>Christopher McCarthy</PERSON>.
   ``Most of the bodies were in dance clothes,'' he said. ``They
were out to have fun. ... I saw wall-to-wall bodies _ an indication
of mass confusion and panic.''
   The blaze was brought under control by <TIME>6 a.m.</TIME>, said a fire
department spokesman, <PERSON>Lee Rodriguez</PERSON>.
   Officials said the fire's rapid spread suggested an accelerant
was used. ``That heavy volume of fire immediately arouses
suspicion,'' said Assistant Fire Chief <PERSON>Robert Ungar</PERSON>.
   One witness heard what sounded like gunshots before the fire.
But <PERSON>Unger</PERSON> would not comment on reports that there was a fight
before the fire broke out or that gasoline cans were found at the
scene.
   EMS Lt. <PERSON>Roy David</PERSON> said he got to the scene just a man believed
to be the lone survivor, apparently the club's disc jockey, was
staggering out.
   ``He walked toward me,'' <PERSON>David</PERSON> said. ``He couldn't talk. He
couldn't say anything. All we could do was treat him.''
   Another witness, <PERSON>Victor Perry</PERSON>, said: ``There were no people
coming out. The <ORGANIZATION>DJ</ORGANIZATION>'s clothes were stuck to his burnt skin which was
coming off.''
   The building received an eviction notice in <DATE>January</DATE> because of
improper exits, and was in the process of being condemned, said
Building Commissioner <PERSON>Charles Smith</PERSON>.
   ``The sad part of it is that this did not have to happen,'' said
Mayor <PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON>, who visited the scene a few hours after the
fire. Many of an estimateed 700 similar clubs operating in <LOCATION>New York
City</LOCATION> may be unsafe, and are being investigated, he said.
   A fire at another <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> social club killed 25 people on <DATE>Oct. 24,
1976</DATE>.
   Ungar put the death toll at 87 or 88 people. A makeshift morgue
was set up in the building next door, and relatives gathered at the
scene. Authorities said the victims were mostly Latin immigrants,
primarily Hondurans.
   <PERSON>Lynn Schulman</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>EMS</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said most of the victims died
from smoke inhalation, but added, ``Some people were trampled.''
   She said the survivor was a 25-year-old man who suffered
second-and third-degree burns on his arms and legs and was taken to
<ORGANIZATION>Jacobi Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in guarded condition.
   Five firefighters, including a battalion chief who broke his
leg, were taken to <ORGANIZATION>Jacobi Hospital</ORGANIZATION> after inhaling smoke and at
least six other firefighters were treated for minor smoke
inhalation at the scene, she said.
   <PERSON>Perry</PERSON> said three sounds like gunshots were heard just prior to
the fire in the building that housed the club, which was only 20
feet by 50 feet.
   <PERSON>Rosemary Green</PERSON>, whose sister-in-law and cousin were at the club,
said she and other people were coming from a neighborhood birthday
party and going to club when she encountered the scene.
   ``People were screaming. They were all burned. ... We're looking
for friends and relatives and nobody's telling us anything,'' she
said. ``Once you got in the entrance there was no way to get out.''
   The building housed a group that organized children's baseball
as well as adult socializing, said <PERSON>Lillian Rivera</PERSON>, a neighbor who
lives across the street from the club.
   At least 30 firefighters from six companies were called to the
scene, <PERSON>Rodriguez</PERSON> said.
   The fire was the deadliest in the continental <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>
since a <DATE>May 28, 1977</DATE>, blaze that consumed the <ORGANIZATION>Beverly Hills Supper
Club</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Southgate</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky.</LOCATION>, killing 164 people. A <DATE>Dec. 31, 1986</DATE>, fire
at a hotel in <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> commonwealth, killed 96
people.
   <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s fire occurred on the 79th anniversary of one of <LOCATION>New

killed 145 people, most of them immigrant workers. The fire led to
reforms governing safety of the workplace.

   The mother of one of the 87 people killed in a
fire at an illegal social club filed a <MONEY>$510 million</MONEY> lawsuit
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>, the first stemming from the inferno, an attorney said.
   The lawsuit seeks that amount in damages from the owners,
lessees and proprietors of the <ORGANIZATION>Happy Land Social Club</ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>.
It also names the man charged with setting the fire.
   Attorney <PERSON>Harry Lipsig</PERSON> said he filed the lawsuit in <ORGANIZATION>Bronx state
Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s trial-level court, on behalf of <PERSON>Jennie
Mae Danzler</PERSON>, mother of <PERSON>Natalie Danzler</PERSON>, 31.
   <PERSON>Lipsig</PERSON> said he also notified city officials he planned to sue
the city ``because of its reckless conduct in connection with the
club.''
   Earlier <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, angry <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> members pressed top city
officials about how Happy Land could have remained open despite
repeated warnings that such clubs were catastrophes waiting to
happen.
   ``If you don't learn from the past you're condemned to repeat
its mistakes,'' council member <PERSON>Sheldon S. Leffler</PERSON> said as he
questioned Police Commissioner <PERSON>Lee Brown</PERSON> at a meeting of the
council's <ORGANIZATION>Public Safety Committee</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We all bear the blame,'' <ORGANIZATION>Bronx Borough</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Fernando
Ferrer</PERSON> said outside the meeting. ``We've got to keep the heat on
until we can resolve this problem.''
   The fire occurred early <DATE>Sunday</DATE> as the club's patrons, many of
them Honduran immigrants, danced and drank liquor in a building
that lacked a liquor license and violated much of the fire code.
   <PERSON>Julio Gonzalez</PERSON>, 36, was charged with 87 counts of felony murder,
87 counts of murder through depraved indifference and one count of
attempted murder and arson. Police said he had argued with his
former girlfriend, a worker at the club.
   The <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> itself has come under criticism since the fire
because a bill that would have increased penalties for operating
clubs illegally was allowed to die in committee.
   But on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, council members criticized fire and building
officials over enforcement of existing laws.
   Several council members said they were surprised to learn that
laws giving the city authority to ``seal'' premises were
interpreted as meaning only that a notice could be posted on the
door.
   During several hours of testimony, city officials insisted a
crackdown on unlicensed social clubs was more than a paper threat.
<PERSON>Brown</PERSON> said eight clubs were closed <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> and 15 on
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by a beefed-up task force of police, fire and buildings
inspectors.
   One establishment ordered closed last year and again <DATE>Monday</DATE> was
<ORGANIZATION>El Caney</ORGANIZATION>, whose board of directors included Mayor <PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON>'
Hispanic affairs commissioner, <PERSON>William Nieves</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Daily News</ORGANIZATION>
disclosed <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> defended his aide at a news conference <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, saying
the <LOCATION>East Harlem</LOCATION> establishment was a non-profit cultural and
educational center, not a commercial social club.
   But he acknowledged that fire and building inspectors found the
building had faulty fire doors and should have been closed. He said
<PERSON>Nieves</PERSON> had resigned from the establishment's board of directors
before taking the city post.
   The building housing Happy Land was owned by real estate
developer <PERSON>Alex DiLorenzo</PERSON> and leased to a group called <ORGANIZATION>One Peach
Associates</ORGANIZATION>, which is partly owned by <PERSON>Jay Weiss</PERSON>, husband of actress
<PERSON>Kathleen Turner</PERSON>. One Peach sublet the building for <MONEY>$1,950</MONEY> a month
to club proprieter <PERSON>Elias Colon</PERSON>, who died in the fire.
   The city has been trying since <DATE>1988</DATE> to close another illegal
Bronx social club in a building owned by <ORGANIZATION>DiLorenzo</ORGANIZATION> and leased by
<PERSON>Weiss</PERSON> and his partner in <LOCATION>One Peach</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Morris Jaffe</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>New York Newsday</ORGANIZATION>
reported.
   Weiss's attorneys have said they never were formally notified of
the violations the city found at Happy Land.
   DiLorenzo is the landlord for two other illegal clubs ordered
closed <DATE>Nov. 20, 1988</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>The Daily News</ORGANIZATION> reported. Those clubs were
ordered shut again this week.
   Separately, <PERSON>DiLorenzo</PERSON> has been accused of 1,585 violations in
four <LOCATION>Harlem</LOCATION> apartment buildings he owned, 150 of them for
conditions considered imminently dangerous, the News said.
   DiLorenzo's attorney, <PERSON>Mark Friedlander</PERSON>, did not immediately
return a telephone call to his office <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.

<HEAD>Social Club Fire: Cruel Incarnation of a Familiar Nightmare</HEAD>

   Fire raced through a <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> social club, snuffing
out lives in a rush of flame and toxic smoke. The mayor, horrified
at the carnage, formed a task force to close down the city's
illegal nightspots.
   That was a year and a half ago.
   <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, the nightmare returned in an even crueler incarnation.
Instead of six people, 87 were now dead in a crowded club. The
city's crackdown had failed. And given continued failure, experts
said <DATE>Monday</DATE>, many more may die.
   ``These places are fire traps. They're supermarkets of crime.
They're in violation of every code imaginable,'' said state <PERSON>Sen.
Jeremy Weinstein</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> Democrat who led an investigation of
illegal social clubs in <DATE>1981</DATE>.
   ``It's not just the city of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, it's true for every city
in the country,'' he said in an interview. ``It's something every
urban area has had to deal with in the last decade. And none has
been dealing with it.''
   Indeed, despite a renewed crackdown announced <DATE>Monday</DATE>. ``It
wouldn't shock me if this happened again,'' said <PERSON>Charles Ryan</PERSON>, an
ex-fire captain and now fire science department chairman at <ORGANIZATION>John
Jay College of Criminal Justice</ORGANIZATION>. ``These places reopen as fast as
they shut 'em down.''
   The problem is not a new one. In <DATE>1942</DATE>, 491 people lost their
lives at <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Cocoanut Grove</LOCATION> club in the nation's worst fire
ever. Like the <ORGANIZATION>Happy Land Social Club</ORGANIZATION>, site of <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s fire, the
<LOCATION>Cocoanut Grove</LOCATION> was overcrowded at the time of the blaze and lacked
adequate exits for patrons.
   That fire led to new national fire codes for emergency exits,
lighting and other factors that could contribute to a blaze.
   Ryan and others said the simple problem is in enforcing such
laws. But it also is more complex than that, they said _ a
combination of the city's enormous problems, shrinking budget and
paralyzing bureaucracy.
   And there is another, equally daunting factor: Tremendous demand
for the illegal but inexpensive clubs, particularly in poor
immigrant communities where life is difficult, diversions are
scarce and danger is a commonplace.
   ``People who are living in tough conditions of life are going to
look for opportunities to blow off some steam,'' said Prof. <PERSON>William
Kornblum</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Social Research Center</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>City
University of New York</ORGANIZATION>'s graduate school. ``They're going to pay
less attention to the dangers around them.''
   The hazards can be legion. At the Happy Land club, authorities
say there was no open fire exit, no first-floor sprinkler system,
no proper emergency lights, and bars on the sole window.
   The only way out was through the front door. It was blocked by
flames, allegedly ignited by an arsonist. Sixty-one men and 26
women died.
   The deaths are all the more tragic for the city's failed effort
to shut down the Happy Land. The task force formed by Mayor <PERSON>Edward
I. Koch</PERSON> in <DATE>1988</DATE> won an order that year that it be closed.
Apparently it was, for a time. And at some point, unknown to the
authorities, it reopened.
   ``Most horrifying is that this should never have happened,''
said Mayor <PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON>. ``That club had been inspected. It had
been cited. And it had been ordered closed.'' He immediately
launched another crackdown, with police posting vacate orders on
187 social clubs <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   But those orders don't solve the problem. Said Ryan: ``Issuing a
piece of paper and saying, `You're closed' doesn't mean anything
unless you come around and whack the guy on the head.''
   With 2,031 inspections by the task force last year,
identification of illegal clubs has been adequate, <PERSON>Ryan</PERSON> said.
``It's the follow-up that's weak,'' he said. ``That's the nut of
the problem: inadequate enforcement.''
   Fuller enforcement would require substantial manpower. The
police estimate there are 1,220 social clubs in the city, with
about 1,000 listed as inactive. But Happy Land was one of those
``inactive'' clubs.
   Kornblum guessed the city in fact has 500 to 600 operating
social clubs _ some legal, many not _ with more in nearby suburbs.
   ``It is true that complete enforcement is futile. The clubs are
always moving to new locations, always trying to stay a step or two
ahead of the authorities,'' <PERSON>Kornblum</PERSON> said. But he said aggressive
followup could save lives, if the city provided the resources.
   There are other approaches as well. With a view of social clubs
as cultural centers, <PERSON>Kornblum</PERSON> suggested low-interest city loans for
legally operated clubs that could take the place of illegal dives.
   Ryan, for his part, suggested cracking down on the liquor
merchants who keep the clubs supplied, and possibly placing a legal
limit on retail liquor sales. <PERSON>Weinstein</PERSON> said he would investigate
the idea.
   Yet <PERSON>Weinstein</PERSON> noted that little of this is new. In <DATE>1981</DATE>, his
panel's report on illegal social clubs included this warning: ``The
potential fire hazard alone is of such proportion that numerous
lives could be lost at any time no matter how minor the fire was at
the outset.''
   ``How ironic that after so many years, we're still back where we
started,'' he said. ``Now a lot of people are going to be up in
arms over this. And then, eventually, it's going to fade _ until it
happens again.''

<HEAD>$510 Million Lawsuit Filed In Wake Of Social Club Fire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY NEUMEISTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An illegal social club served alcohol without a
license to an already-drunk man who is accused of killing 87 people
when he torched the place, a <MONEY>$510 million</MONEY> lawsuit says.
   The lawsuit was filed <DATE>Thursday</DATE> as relatives and friends of
victims held funerals and wakes, and as the accused, <PERSON>Julio
Gonzalez</PERSON>, appeared in <ORGANIZATION>Bronx Criminal Court</ORGANIZATION> for a hearing.
   About 1,000 mourners gathered <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> outside <PERSON>Ortiz</PERSON>
Funeral Home in the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> for the wakes of six victims of the <ORGANIZATION>Happy
Land Social Club</ORGANIZATION> fire.
   ``We want justice,'' said <PERSON>Edith Melendez</PERSON>, the girlfriend of <PERSON>Luis
Drummond</PERSON>, who died in the fire <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. ``Give him (Gonzalez) to us.
We could take him to the park, pour some gasoline on him like he
did to our family and friends.''
   The suit was filed in <ORGANIZATION>Bronx state Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s
trial-level court, by attorney <PERSON>Harry Lipsig</PERSON> on behalf of <PERSON>Jennie Mae
Danzler</PERSON>, mother of another fire victim, 31-year-old <PERSON>Natalie Danzler</PERSON>.
   The suit names as defendants the social club itself; <ORGANIZATION>Clarendon
Place Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, owner of the premises; <ORGANIZATION>Little Peach Realty</ORGANIZATION>, lessee;
<PERSON>Alex DiLorenzo III</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jay Weiss</PERSON> and <PERSON>Morris Jaffe</PERSON>, officers of <LOCATION>Little
Peach</LOCATION>; <PERSON>Elena Colon</PERSON>, widow of club owner <PERSON>Elias Colon</PERSON>, who died in
the fire; and <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON>. <PERSON>Weiss</PERSON> is the husband of actress <PERSON>Kathleen
Turner</PERSON>.
   The suit seeks <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> in compensatory damages and <MONEY>$500
million</MONEY> in punitive damages. It claims, among other things, that
Happy Land served alcohol without a license and served it to
<PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> when he already was intoxicated.
   Authorities <DATE>Thursday</DATE> continued to crack down on illegal social
clubs, with more than 100 police officers transferred from the
<ORGANIZATION>Tactical Narcotics Teams</ORGANIZATION> to a reactivated <ORGANIZATION>Social Club Task Force</ORGANIZATION>.
The force has visited hundreds of social clubs citywide since
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s fire, closing about two dozen and issuing citations.
   Meanwhile, Criminal Court <PERSON>Judge Effrain Alvarado</PERSON> ruled <DATE>Thursday</DATE>
at hearing over legal representation of <PERSON>Gonzales</PERSON> that the Legal Aid
Society may continue as his counsel through the grand jury process.
But the judge appointed lawyer <PERSON>Richard Berne</PERSON> to take over the case
after that.
   Security was tight during the hearing. At one point, a man
yelled, ``Julio, I'm going to watch you.'' The man was a friend of
one of the fire victims.
   Gonzalez, a 36-year-old Cuban emigre, was arrested <DATE>Sunday</DATE> and
charged with 87 counts of murder through depraved indifference, 87
counts of felony murder, and one count of attempted murder and
arson. He allegedly set the fire after a fight with his
ex-girlfriend, who worked at the club.
   Mayor <PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> contested a published report
that his director of <ORGANIZATION>Latino Affairs</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>William Nieves</PERSON>, had operated
an illegal social club.
   <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> said the establishment, called <ORGANIZATION>El Caney</ORGANIZATION>, was really a
cultural center. He acknowledged the site had been cited for
building and fire code violations and should have been closed.
   Members of the <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> grilled top city officials about the
fire <DATE>Thursday</DATE> during a meeting of the council's <ORGANIZATION>Public Safety
Committee</ORGANIZATION>.
   They demanded to know why Happy Land was not padlocked after the
city discovered it was operating illegally and unsafely. Fire and
buildings department officials said the law was unclear whether a
building could be padlocked without a hearing.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> and several <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> cities have begun cracking down
on illegal social clubs like <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s Happy Land, the firetrap
where 87 people died in a gasoline-fed blaze.
   Officials in many cities around the nation say they don't have
such clubs, which typically operate without licenses and stay open
after hours. But in those cities that do, <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s fire sent a
cautionary message.
   In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON> said <DATE>Monday</DATE> he was conferring
with the <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> speaker about legislation to regulate the
clubs, including stiffer penalties for violations.
   <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> acknowledged that social clubs are useful as ethnic
meeting places, but he had a message for patrons: ``I would tell
them to tell the management they're not going to frequent them
again until they make them safe again.''
   In <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, Building Commissioner <PERSON>Daniel Weil</PERSON> said city
officials are inspecting at least 100 registered non-profit social
clubs, and will be trying to locate any unlicensed clubs in hopes
of preventing a tragedy like the Happy Land fire.
   ``When a tragedy like this occurs, you don't want to ignore
it,'' <PERSON>Weil</PERSON> said.
   There was similar concern in several <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> cities.
   In <LOCATION>Elizabeth</LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON>Thomas G. Dunn</PERSON> said city inspectors would
put at least seven illegal nightclubs out of business as a result
of the Happy Land fire. Two owners of one club were arrested <DATE>Monday</DATE>
and about 100 patrons chased from the place, he said.
   In <LOCATION>Paterson</LOCATION>, vice squad Sgt. <PERSON>Michael Recca</PERSON> said three or four
such establishments have been shut down in the last month.
   ``Generally the violations involve illegal alcoholic beverage
sales and with that we find a high incidence of drug sales between
patrons,'' he said.
   In <LOCATION>Camden</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Cyrus Saxon</PERSON>, the city's alcoholic beverage control
investigator, is seeking inspections of unlicensed social clubs in
the city. <PERSON>Saxon</PERSON> said most of the night-spots do not have liquor
licenses, but serve alcohol and cater to a dancing crowd.
   ``The problem is you don't really know,'' said <PERSON>Saxon</PERSON>. ``You
don't know if these places have enough exits or fire escapes.''

   Sobs and cries from hundreds of mourners rang
out at a Roman Catholic church as the caskets of 17 victims from
the <ORGANIZATION>Happy Land Social Club</ORGANIZATION> fire were arrayed in the form of a large
crucifix.
   One pink coffin for a female victim and 16 blue coffins for
males were carried <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> from the <ORGANIZATION>Rivera Funeral Home</ORGANIZATION> in the
<LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> across the street from <LOCATION>St. Joseph</LOCATION>'s church.
   The dead were among 87 people, most of them Honduran immigrants,
who perished <DATE>Sunday</DATE> in the illegal social club that was allegedly
set afire by a spurned lover. It was the city's worst fire in 79
years.
   ``God never, never abandons us. Sudden death is also sudden
mercy,'' the Rev. <PERSON>Henry Hill</PERSON> told more than 1,000 mourners packed
inside the church.
   ``My heart goes out to each and every family,'' said Hill, a
Honduran native. ``The church understands your loss and extends its
sympathies and love.''
   Another 1,000 people unable to fit in the church huddled outside
on the street, about 10 blocks from the scene of the fire.
   The Honduran government declared three days of national mourning
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and said 78 victims had been identified as Honduran. Most
of the bodies will be buried in <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>.
   But relatives who are illegally in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> may not be
able to return if they travel to <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION> to attend burial services.
   Before the Mass, hundreds of mourners prayed in the funeral home
and then stood in the street. At least three women fainted and more
than 15 required medical attention.
   <PERSON>Jose Alvarez</PERSON>, who came for the wake of his brother <PERSON>Denny</PERSON>, 22,
left the funeral home sobbing and clinging to a cousin and friend.
   Across the street on the church steps, <PERSON>Denny</PERSON>'s father, <LOCATION>Pedro</LOCATION>,
railed against the man charged with setting the blaze, 36-year-old
Cuban emigrant <PERSON>Julio Gonzalez</PERSON>.
   ``They ought to take him and give him a public hanging. People
like that don't deserve to live,'' <PERSON>Alvarez</PERSON> said.
   Roses and daffodils in vases and coffee cans were placed in
front of the the smoke-blackened red brick social club. Burned
coats, some still on hangers, lay piled against the building. A
paper sign on a tree listed the victims' names and ages.
   Nearby, family members went to a school to collect their
relatives' personal effects.
   <PERSON>Carlos Pena</PERSON> clutched a manila envelope which held a watch, keys,
and some cash his brother <PERSON>Eli</PERSON>, 26, had when he died at the club.
   The watch arrived with <ORGANIZATION>Eli</ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Carlos</PERSON> said the
timepiece would now be his. ``It means a lot, a reminder,'' he said.
   The wake at the funeral home began three hours after a <ORGANIZATION>Bronx
Civil Court</ORGANIZATION> refused to let the landlord of the social club reclaim
the establishment until it decides whether the late tenant's widow
should replace her husband in an eviction suit.
   The hearing, scheduled before the blaze <DATE>Sunday</DATE> whose victims
included club proprietor <PERSON>Elias Colon</PERSON>, did not delve into
responsibility for the tragedy. It only dealt with the demand of
the building's landlord, <ORGANIZATION>One Peach Associates</ORGANIZATION>, for <ORGANIZATION>Colon</ORGANIZATION>'s eviction
for failing to pay rent.
   Mayor <PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON> said legislation would be submitted today to
<ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> that would impose heavy penalties on landlords and
operators of illegal social clubs.

<TEXT>
   At least 52 drinking and dancing clubs listed by
the city as ``nuisances'' are on city-owned properties, making
government the biggest landlord of the illegal establishments,
according to published reports.
   A crackdown began after 87 people died <DATE>March 25</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>Happy
Land Social Club</ORGANIZATION>, an illegal social club in the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>, in an arson
fire that was the deadliest blaze in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> since <DATE>1977</DATE>.
   The bodies of 48 of the victims were flown <DATE>Sunday</DATE> from <LOCATION>Kennedy
International Airport</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION> aboard a DC-8 chartered by the
<ORGANIZATION>American Red Cross</ORGANIZATION>. In all, 79 of the victims were believed to be
Hondurans.
   ``Most of them went to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> with high hopes, and
they came back dead. We are very sad,'' said Honduran President
<PERSON>Rafael Leonardo Callejas</PERSON>, who went to <LOCATION>San Pedro Sulla</LOCATION> to be with
dozens of grieving relatives.
   A grand jury on <DATE>Friday</DATE> indicted 36-year-old Cuban immigrant
<PERSON>Julio Gonzalez</PERSON> on charges of murder, arson, attempted murder and
assault. He is accused of starting the fire with gasoline after
being rejected by a former girlfriend who worked at the club.
   In the latest citywide social club sweep from <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> to
early <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Social Club Task Force</ORGANIZATION> members visited 356 clubs and
found 122 of them open, said police Sgt. <PERSON>Diane Kubler</PERSON>. They issued
54 vacate orders, 132 summonses and 193 notices of violation. One
person was arrested.
   Clubs such as the <ORGANIZATION>Wanda Social Club</ORGANIZATION>, which was slapped with a
vacate order <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, are a particular embarassment to the
city. The city is the landlord.
   The <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION>, citing police records, reported <DATE>Sunday</DATE> that
52 of the 1,255 clubs listed as ``nuisance'' establishments were in
properties owned by the city, including two in Housing Authority
projects. The records portray the city as the largest landlord of
such clubs.
   Buildings, finance and <ORGANIZATION>Department of Housing Preservation and
Development</ORGANIZATION> records indicated there were 46 to 66 social clubs in
city-owned buildings, department Commissioner <PERSON>Felice Michetti</PERSON> told
the Times.
   Department inspectors were surveying them, she said.
   City-owned residential buildings house as many as 46 illegal
clubs, the <ORGANIZATION>Daily News</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, basing its report on a review
of <ORGANIZATION>Buildings Department</ORGANIZATION> and real estate records as well as reports
from inspections by city agencies.
   The News said the number could increase as city officials check
contradictory listings of illegal clubs.
   The city inherited the clubs along with vast numbers of tenants
and abandoned buildings, said <PERSON>Lee Jones</PERSON>, a spokesman for Mayor
<PERSON>David N. Dinkins</PERSON>.
   ``Is it embarrassing?'' Jones said. ``It's something we're going
to have to deal with.''
   In the event of death or injury in a fire or other calamity, the
city might be liable in lawsuits involving such establishments, the
<ORGANIZATION>Times</ORGANIZATION> said.
   <PERSON>Ms. Michetti</PERSON> said there were two grounds for city action. If the
tenant doesn't have a bona fide lease, ``we can bring an eviction
action,'' she said. Otherwise, the city can move for a vacate order
and ultimately padlock the property for violating fire and building
codes or selling alcohol without a state license.
   The city has moved against two other city-owned social club
tenants besides the <LOCATION>Wanda</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Times</ORGANIZATION> said. Authorities last week
issued a vacate order for a club in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> and closed another in
the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>.

   The tragedy was foretold, its prevention
attempted. But law enforcement failed customers of the <ORGANIZATION>Happy Land

other illegal nightspots.
   ``These places are fire traps. They're in violation of every

Eighty-seven lives snuffed out in a rush of flame and toxic smoke

were trapped and felled in moments.
   It should not have happened. A year and a half ago, when seven
died in a similar fire, the mayor formed a task force to close down
unlicensed clubs. Soon after, the city ordered Happy Land closed
for fire safety violations.
   It apparently did close for a time _ and then opened again,
unnoticed by officialdom. ``These places reopen as fast as they

proportion that numerous lives could be lost at any time no matter
how minor the fire was at the outset.''
   ``How ironic that after so many years, we're still back where we
started,'' he said. ``Now a lot of people are going to be up in
arms over this. And then, eventually, it's going to fade _ until it
happens again.''

   Prosecutors on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> investigated the tangled
ownership of the <ORGANIZATION>Happy Land Social Club</ORGANIZATION> to determine whether the
landlords, including actress <PERSON>Kathleen Turner</PERSON>'s husband, share
responsibility in the fiery deaths of 87 people.
   The district attorney's office also said a grand jury had begun
hearing evidence against <PERSON>Julio Gonzalez</PERSON>, a 36-year-old Cuban emigre
who reportedly confessed to setting the fire at the illegal
discotheque early <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   ``We'll have a made case even if he backs out of the
confession,'' said <PERSON>Edward McCarthy</PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>
prosecutor's office.
   Gonzalez allegedly bought <MONEY>$1</MONEY> worth of gasoline and ignited it in
the doorway to the two-story unlicensed club after a fight with his
ex-girlfriend, who worked there. The club had no emergency exits
and no second-story windows; the victims had neither the time nor
the means to escape.
   The building that housed the club was leased to Happy Land's
operator by <PERSON>Miss Turner</PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON>Jay Weiss</PERSON>, who in turn had
leased it from one of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s major real estate operators, <PERSON>Alex
DiLorenzo III</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>McCarthy</PERSON> said the issue of landlord responsibility wasn't clear.
Prosecutors still had to determine whether anyone beyond the club
operator, <PERSON>Elias Colon</PERSON>, who died in the fire, knew the building had
been served with notices of building code violations.
   <PERSON>Weiss</PERSON>, through a statement by his lawyer, <PERSON>Roger Boyle</PERSON>,
acknowledged that <ORGANIZATION>Little Peach Realty</ORGANIZATION>, a company he owns with
<PERSON>Morris Jaffe</PERSON>, leased the building in <DATE>1985</DATE> from a DiLorenzo company,
<ORGANIZATION>Clarendon Place Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
   Two years later, Little Peach leased the club to <LOCATION>Colon</LOCATION>, but
<PERSON>Boyle</PERSON> said that since last <DATE>spring</DATE> the company had been trying to
evict Colon for not paying rent. The case was to have been heard in
court <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Boyle</PERSON> said <PERSON>Weiss</PERSON> would have no further statement.
   Miss <PERSON>Turner</PERSON> said through her publicist, <PERSON>Susan Geller</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Los
Angeles</LOCATION>: ``This is an act of a violent madman. It's a tragedy. It
doesn't reflect on me or my husband.''
   Miss <ORGANIZATION>Turner</ORGANIZATION> is in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> starring in a Broadway revival of
``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.''
   According to Assistant Fire Chief <PERSON>William Feehan</PERSON>, inspectors are
supposed to serve notices of code violations on the responsible
person at the scene and not necessarily to building owners.
   The Happy Land tragedy spurred Mayor <PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON> to reactivate
a police, fire and buildings department task force formed in the
wake of another fatal club fire.
   Fire <ORGANIZATION>Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>John Mulligan</PERSON> said the agency received
nearly 1,000 calls <DATE>Monday</DATE>, the first day of operating a special
number for reports of illegal social clubs.
   <PERSON>Mulligan</PERSON> said the names and addresses of some 500 clubs were
divulged.
   ``The department is elated,'' <PERSON>Mulligan</PERSON> said. ``It shows the
public is aware of the problem now and there's not much you can do
about it unless the public gets involved.''
   The man charged with 87 counts of murder, <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON>, remained in
the prison ward of <ORGANIZATION>Kings County Hospital</ORGANIZATION>, awaiting his next court
appearance.
   According to District Attorney <PERSON>Robert Johnson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> made
admissions to people he had spoken to after early <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s fire.
The district attorney said <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> gave police a videotaped
confession later in the day in which he admitted he torched the
Happy Land with gasoline in a fit of pique against his former
girlfriend, <PERSON>Lydia Feliciano</PERSON>, who worked at the club.
   ``We're going to put on (the witness stand) the girlfriend, the
guy that sold him the gasoline, the two guys he talked to _ the
neighbors _ at his house,'' <PERSON>McCarthy</PERSON> said.
   ``And then we have the container that held the gasoline, his
sneakers, which were soaked with gasoline. We even cut up a hunk of
the floor and brought it in to prove the burn pattern was caused by
gasoline.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Feliciano</PERSON> escaped the fire without serious injury. One of
the four other survivors, club disc jockey <PERSON>Ruben Valladarez</PERSON>, was in
critical but stable condition at <ORGANIZATION>Jacobi Hospital</ORGANIZATION> with burns over <PERCENT>30
percent</PERCENT> of this body. Hospital spokeswoman <PERSON>Vicki Ciampa</PERSON> said he had
about a 50-50 chance of survival.

   Prosecutors intend to use a pair of
gasoline-soaked sneakers and a hunk of dance floor to help make
their case against a man charged with setting the fire that killed
87 people in a social club.
   A grand jury <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> began hearing evidence against 36-year-old
<PERSON>Julio Gonzalez</PERSON>, charged with 87 murders in the blaze at the <ORGANIZATION>Happy
Land Social Club</ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>. Police said he set the fire early
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> after being snubbed by an ex-girlfriend who worked there.
   ``We'll have a made case even if he backs out of the
confession,'' said <PERSON>Edward McCarthy</PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>
prosecutor's office.
   Gonzalez was transferred <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to a prison unit within the
psychiatric ward at <ORGANIZATION>Bellevue Hospital</ORGANIZATION>, where a fellow inmate said
he raged for hours against his ex-girlfriend.
   ``He is so emotionally distraught that tears keep coming down,''
the inmate, <PERSON>Louis Cuascut</PERSON>, said in today's <LOCATION>New York Post</LOCATION>. ``He
seems very, very depressed.''
   The Happy Land club had been ordered closed for fire and safety
code violations and the landlord was trying to evict the owner for
non-payment of rent.
   The building that housed the illegal club was subleased to the
club's operator by a company co-owned by actress <PERSON>Kathleen Turner</PERSON>'s
husband, <PERSON>Jay Weiss</PERSON>. He leased it from one of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s biggest
landlords, <PERSON>Alex DiLorenzo III</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Turner</PERSON> said she was shocked by the fire but that her husband
wasn't to blame.
   ``It's unfortunate that it was that building but the fact is
that you can even throw a firebomb into <ORGANIZATION>McDonald's</ORGANIZATION> and it would
have had the same result,'' <PERSON>Turner</PERSON> said outside her <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>
apartment, the <ORGANIZATION>Post</ORGANIZATION> reported today.
   The actress, starring in a Broadway revival of ``Cat on a Hot
Tin Roof,'' said she was afraid that people would come to her home
seeking vengeance.
   Turner also said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> through her publicist, ``This is an act
of a violent madman. It's a tragedy. It doesn't reflect on me or my
husband.''
   Among those scheduled to testify against <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> are his
ex-girlfriend, <PERSON>Lydia Feliciano</PERSON>, a worker at the club; and the man
who sold <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> the <MONEY>$1</MONEY> worth of gasoline he allegedly used to
start the blaze.
   ``And then we have the container that held the gasoline, his
sneakers, which were soaked with gasoline,'' <PERSON>McCarthy</PERSON> said. ``We
even cut up a hunk of the floor and brought it in to prove the burn
pattern was caused by gasoline.''
   District Attorney <PERSON>Robert Johnson</PERSON> said <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> gave police a
videotaped statement in which he admitted that he torched the Happy
Land in a pique against <PERSON>Ms. Feliciano</PERSON>.
   Besides <PERSON>Ms. Feliciano</PERSON>, four other people escaped the inferno.
   Authorities had warned <PERSON>DiLorenzo</PERSON> that Happy Land was riddled
with violations, including an illegally added second floor, no
sprinklers on the first floor, no second exit and no fire alarms,
Building Commissioner <PERSON>Charles Smith Jr.</PERSON> said in today's <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>
Times.
   Normally the violations report would have been forwarded by the
owner to the leaseholder, but <PERSON>Weiss</PERSON>' attorneys said they never
received a formal notice of the violations. They would not comment
on whether they knew of them.
   <PERSON>Weiss</PERSON>, through his lawyer <PERSON>Roger Boyle</PERSON>, said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that <ORGANIZATION>One
Peach Associates</ORGANIZATION>, a company he owns with <PERSON>Morris Jaffe</PERSON>, leased the
building in <DATE>1985</DATE> from <PERSON>DiLorenzo</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Clarendon Place Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
   One Peach two years later leased the club to its operator, <LOCATION>Elias
Colon</LOCATION>, for up to <MONEY>$1,950</MONEY> a month. <PERSON>Boyle</PERSON> said that since last <DATE>spring</DATE>
the company had been trying to evict Colon for not paying rent. The
case was to have been heard in court today. Colon died in the fire.
   One Peach also leased space to a second after-hours club, called
La Salsa, around the corner from Happy Land, for <MONEY>$2,500</MONEY> a month,
the <ORGANIZATION>Daily News</ORGANIZATION> reported today.
   Neighborhood residents said La Salsa, too, was packed with
revelers <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. The club has one door and no windows.
Because of fire code violations, it had been ordered to close in
<DATE>August 1988</DATE>.
   Because many of the fire victims were poor Honduran immigrants,
10 airlines have offered to ship the remains free from <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> to
<LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Larry Mackler</PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>American Red

   The Happy Land social club might better have
been called The Disaster Waiting to Happen, according to city
officials.
   ``It was a fire trap,'' said <PERSON>Anthony De Vita</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Fire
Department</ORGANIZATION>'s command chief.
   A fire that spread rapidly through the two-story brick building
early <DATE>Sunday</DATE> killed 87 people. A vengeful former boyfriend of the
club's ticket seller allegedly set the fire with gasoline.
   City inspectors had ordered the illegal club closed 16 months
ago.
   ``We close them today; they open them tomorrow,'' Deputy Fire
Commissioner <PERSON>Robert Ungar</PERSON> said.
   The club was riddled with safety faults, inspectors said. They
included:
   _Not enough exits. There were only two doors on the front of the
building, one of which was shuttered at the time of the fire. The
other was in flames.
   _Bars on the sole window, which was in the coat-check room.
   _A staircase so narrow that only one person could use it at a
time. It was so steep at 60 degrees that fire spokesman <PERSON>John
Mulligan</PERSON> said he was reminded of the stairs on a ship.
   _Employees who were unequipped and untrained to deal with fires.
   _No sprinkler system on the first floor.
   _A lack of proper emergency lighting or signs to show patrons
the way to safety.
   _No certification the structure was flameproof.
   The fire was apparently set at the front door, where <PERSON>Julio
Gonzalez</PERSON>, 36, allegedly sprinkled gasoline from a plastic jug. Only
three people were able to escape.
   ``To save themselves, they would have had to pass through the
fire to get to the exit,'' said Fire Department Chief of Operations
<PERSON>William Feehan</PERSON>.
   The club had no liquor or cabaret license. Its patrons paid a <MONEY>$5</MONEY>
entrance fee to enjoy alcohol, dance on a large upstairs dance
floor or a small one downstairs and mingle with a clientele that
included Hondurans and, more recently, other Hispanics.
   Many of its most loyal customers were from <LOCATION>Trujillo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>.
The disk jockey played music ranging from salsa and reggae to the
calypso popular on <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>' <LOCATION>Atlantic Coast</LOCATION>. Patrons would knock on
the front door to be admitted before the door was closed and locked
again. It usually was open until <TIME>6 a.m.</TIME>
   On <DATE>Nov. 21, 1988</DATE>, the city ordered it vacated.
   It was unclear if the club remained open or reopened later, but
on <DATE>July 24, 1989</DATE>, its manager was arrested by police and charged
with selling liquor illegally, said Buildings Commissioner <PERSON>Charles
Smith</PERSON>.
   It was ordered vacated again on <DATE>Nov. 1</DATE> but it didn't stay that
way.
   Mayor <PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON> said he didn't know the building's current
owner. Residents said the manager of the club was <ORGANIZATION>Elias Colon</ORGANIZATION>.
   One former patron, <PERSON>Arthur McIntyre</PERSON>, said he convinced his
girlfriend not to go to Happy Land <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   ``It was a dangerous building from the beginning but it was a
lot of fun,'' he said. ``But a few months ago it got bad. People
started bringing guns and drugs and wearing knives. I figured
something was about to explode.''
   <PERSON>Denice Garcia</PERSON>, another area resident, called the club ``sleazy''
and said the building did not seem sturdy and the large dance floor
sometimes moved.

   Honduran President <PERSON>Rafael Leonardo Callejas</PERSON> said
<DATE>Friday</DATE> his country was donating <MONEY>$25,000</MONEY> to build a recreation
center in the neighborhood where 87 people died when fire swept
through an illegal social club.
   Cardinal <PERSON>John O'Connor</PERSON> said the archdiocese of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> also was
committed to building the center to diminish the need for illegal
social clubs in the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> neighborhood.
   The announcements were made at a memorial Mass for the victims
of the <ORGANIZATION>Happy Land Social Club</ORGANIZATION> tragedy.
   Callejas told the more than 750 people inside <ORGANIZATION>St. Thomas Aquinas
Church</ORGANIZATION> and more than 100 people listening through loudspeakers
outside that the Honduran people raised the money, and that <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY>
of it was from his own pocket.
   <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> said the church would match the contribution if the
city would donate the land. He promised to donate <MONEY>$999.99</MONEY> of his
own.
   Most of the 87 people who died <DATE>March 25</DATE> when fire ravaged the
club were Honduran immigrants.
   <PERSON>Julio Gonzalez</PERSON>, 36, a Cuban immigrant, has been charged with
setting the blaze.
   The Mass, originally scheduled for <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at <ORGANIZATION>St. Patrick's
Cathedral</ORGANIZATION>, was shifted to <LOCATION>St. Thomas</LOCATION>, two blocks from the gutted
social club building, so Callejas could attend, officials said.
   ``Too many immigrants in our country are forced to live in
crowded, inadequate and dangerous housing conditions,'' <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON>,
speaking in Spanish, told families and friends of the victims.
   These immigrants have menial jobs because they are illegal, and
``it comes as no surprise that they are forced to use crowded and
dangerous facilities for various forms of social activities because
they are so poor,'' <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> said.
   Callejas told the crowd that ``we are together in your pain.''

   <PERSON>Jose Ambrosio Alvarez</PERSON> left for
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> three years ago with cooking skills learned in a
hospital kitchen and an immigrant's dream of a better life.
   On <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, his body was returned in a plain wooden box along
with the bodies of 47 other Hondurans killed with him in a blaze at
an illegal <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> social club.
   ``You leave here with such high hopes of better things,'' said
his 32-year-old brother, <PERSON>Gerardo Alvarez</PERSON>. ``This has been a
terrible blow to us.''
   At least 79 of the 87 people killed in the <DATE>March 25</DATE> fire at the
<ORGANIZATION>Happy Land Social Club</ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> were Hondurans. Authorities
have said a Cuban immigrant set the blaze after being spurned by
his girlfriend, a club employee. The Happy Land club was a
home-away-from-home for Honduran immigrants, who went there to
dance, chat and drink.
   The coffins on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> arrived in the northern industrial city of
<LOCATION>San Pedro Sula</LOCATION> aboard a DC-8 transport plane chartered by the <ORGANIZATION>Red
Cross</ORGANIZATION>.
   The victims, mostly young people in their late teens and early
20s, were largely poor immigrants from <LOCATION>San Pedro Sula</LOCATION> and towns
dotting <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>' <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> coast such as <LOCATION>Puerto Cortes</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tela</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>La
Ceiba</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Trujillo</PERSON>.
   The story of 27-year-old <PERSON>Jose Alvarez</PERSON> is familiar in these parts
of high unemployment, low wages and wide poverty.
   Clothing and furniture factories and food packing plants are <LOCATION>San
Pedro Sula</LOCATION>'s backbone. But the jobs they provide are far fewer than
the numbers of poor from outlying areas who flock to the city
looking for work.
   At the airport early <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, family members clung to each other
for support as an orange forklift unloaded the coffins four at a
time. The coffins were laid in rows on the airport tarmac before
the grief-stricken families.
   Wreaths were laid atop each box and the Roman Catholic bishop of
<LOCATION>San Pedro Sula</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Monsignor Jaime Brufeau</PERSON>, said a brief <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>.
   ``Most of them went to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> with high hopes, and
they come back dead. We are very sad,'' said President <PERSON>Rafael
Leonardo Callejas</PERSON>, who came to <LOCATION>San Pedro Sula</LOCATION> to be with dozens of
mourning relatives.
   Army helicopters were to fly some bodies to the victims' home
towns. Others were simply carried away by their families.
   Many relatives, who stood at the airport under a hot tropical
sun for more than two hours, collapsed and were carried away by
<ORGANIZATION>Honduran Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> volunteers.
   One man's grief broke into fury toward the suspected arsonist.
   ``Damned Cuban, I'll kill you!'' shouted <PERSON>Juan Alberto Pena</PERSON>, 19,
clenching his fist. Pena, of <LOCATION>Progreso</LOCATION>, was at the airport awaiting
the body of his brother, <PERSON>Jeremias</PERSON>.
   On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, Cuban immigrant <PERSON>Julio Gonzalez</PERSON>, 36, was indicted by a
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> state grand jury on 178 counts of murder, arson and other
charges. Authorities say he set the fire at the Happy Land club
with gasoline from a nearby gas station.
   Some relatives said they were preparing to file lawsuits.
   ``We have made our decision,'' a grim-faced <PERSON>Gregorio Hernandez</PERSON>
said. His nephew, 24-year-old <PERSON>Jose Manuel Marquez Hernandez</PERSON>, was a
victim.
   ``We're going to sue the city (of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>), the gas station and
the owners of the building,'' <PERSON>Hernandez</PERSON> said.
   Wakes and funerals were scheduled for today and <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> in
surrounding towns.

   Others stopped off <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> to add their contribution to a
burgeoning memorial of flowers and funeral wreaths laid out on the
sidewalk.
   Like a peculiar urban pilgrimage, the scene is repeated over and
over as friends and neighbors, mourners and the merely curious come
to see where 87 people died in <DATE>last Sunday</DATE>'s fire at the illegal
social club.
   <PERSON>Robert Robayo</PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON>Estella</PERSON>, somberly stood in the
drizzle and stared blankly at charred coats that lay unclaimed
behind the flowers.
   ``I can't believe they had so many people in there. It looks so
small,'' <PERSON>Robayo</PERSON> said. ``They should never have had so many people
in there.''
   In the week since the disaster, the city has cracked down on
illegal social clubs, beefing up enforcement by transferring more
than 100 police officers from a special anti-drug squad.
   In raids <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> and <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, police found 74 of
89 clubs they visited closed. They served 17 summonses and 36
notices for building and fire code infractions at 15 others.
   At least four illegal clubs in the <LOCATION>Washington Heights</LOCATION> section of
<LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> did not open this <DATE>weekend</DATE> because of the crackdown.
   The four clubs, said a source familiar with their operation who
spoke on condition of anonymity, usually buy just enough liquor for
the <DATE>weekend</DATE> but opted not to buy any liquor or to open this <DATE>weekend</DATE>.
   A woman stood outside what has become the city's best-known
club, shaking her head as she recalled the numerous times she
danced there. Safety never occurred to her.
   ``You're in there drinking. You're dancing. You're not thinking
about that,'' said the woman, who would identify herself only as
Celeste. ``But now, when I go to other clubs, I'm going to look and
see if they have a rear exit.'' Were it not for the small group of
firefighters and police officers assigned to protect the building,
Happy Land might seem like just another charred building in the
<LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>. The East Tremont section where the building sits is bleak,
with littered, vacant lots next to deteriorated buildings.
   At the <ORGANIZATION>Virgin Islands American Bar on East Tremont</ORGANIZATION>, a block from
<ORGANIZATION>Happy Land</ORGANIZATION>, several patrons said they had never previously heard of
the club.
   ``I couldn't even tell if the place was open or not,'' said the
bar's manager, who would identify herself only as <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON>.
   But a woman who visited the building insisted everyone in the
area knew about Happy Land.
   ``How could you not know about it? It was like the only place
you could go to around here and afford,'' said the woman, who would
not give her name.
   ``Some are dropping off flowers. Others just stop and say a
prayer,'' said Fire Marshal <PERSON>Larry Lynch</PERSON> of the steady stream of
visitors.
   One onlooker asked if the neighborhood was returning to normal.
   ``Are you kidding? This place is never normal. This is the
<LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>,'' answered a man who identified himself as <PERSON>Alberto</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Alberto</PERSON>, who was walking around trying to sell two pairs of used
trousers and slippers, stared across the street at the Happy Land
building.
   ``Look, the drugs are still here. People are still scared to go
out in the street. Some of these young kids are crazy and will
stick you for nothing. No. Nothing's changed here. It's just gone
from bad to worse.''

<HEAD>Cuban Immigrant Pleads Innocent to Social Club Fire Charges</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The man accused of starting a nightclub fire
that killed 87 people in the deadliest <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> blaze in 13 years
pleaded innocent <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to 174 murder charges and other counts.
   <PERSON>Julio Gonzalez</PERSON>, guarded by four marshals and speaking through a
Spanish translator, mumbled ``no culpable'' when asked how he
pleaded to the charges during his arraignment in the borough of the
<LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>.
   Gonzalez, 36, is accused of setting the <DATE>March 25</DATE> fire that raced
through the Happy Land social club, trapping most patrons on the
second floor of the tiny, illegal establishment and killing 87
people, mostly Honduran immigrants. Only five people escaped the
deadliest blaze since a <DATE>1977</DATE> nightclub fire in <LOCATION>Southgate</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky</LOCATION>.
   A grand jury indicted <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> on double murder charges for each
victim, one for murder by arson and the other for murder by
depraved indifference. He also was charged with two counts of arson
and one each of assault and attempted murder.
   At the time, there was speculation that <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> could be
sentenced to several thousand years in prison if convicted on all
charges.
   But state <PERSON>Judge Burton R. Roberts</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON>
could be sentenced to only one term of 25 years to life and might
be eligible for parole in 25 years even if convicted on all murder
charges. <PERSON>Roberts</PERSON> said that under state law, when there are two or
more victims from a single crime, sentences must run concurrently
rather than consecutively, as in separate crimes.
   The judge acknowledged that the social club fire was a special
case, but said he wanted to dispel misconceptions about a possible
penalty.
   Roberts set the next court appearance for <DATE>April 25</DATE>. ``I
understand we're a long way from trial,'' the judge said.
   Gonzalez is undergoing a psychiatric evaluation at <ORGANIZATION>Bellevue
Hospital</ORGANIZATION>.
   Assistant District Attorney <PERSON>Eric Warner</PERSON> gave <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON>'
court-appointed attorney, <PERSON>Richard W. Berne</PERSON>, transcripts of a
videotaped statement in which <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON>, according to police, admits
setting the fire after a fight with a former girlfriend working at
the club. <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> said he would also give <PERSON>Berne</PERSON> the videotape to
copy.
   <PERSON>Berne</PERSON> said he planned to move for dismissal of all charges on
grounds he was not given access to the taped statement before
having to decide whether his client should testify before the grand
jury. Gonzalez did not appear before the panel.
   Berne conceded his motion to dismiss, even if granted, was a
``procedural matter'' and that the prosecution would be sure to
request a new indictment of Gonzalez.

The man accused of torching an illegal Bronx social club was indicted on 178 
counts of murder, arson and other charges <DATE>Friday</DATE> in connection with the blaze 
that killed 87 people. 
</P>
<P>
A state grand jury indicted <PERSON>Julio Gonzalez</PERSON> on one count of second-degree murder 
and one count of murder in the commission of a felony for each person killed 
early last <DATE>Sunday</DATE> inside the Happy Land social club. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez was also indicted on two counts of arson and single counts of 
attempted murder and assault. He was not present when the indictment was 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, 36, who is due back in court on <DATE>April 12</DATE>, could be sentenced to 2,000 
years in prison if convicted of all charges, Assistant Dist. Atty. <PERSON>Eric Warner</PERSON> 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"No case is open and shut," <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> said. "We have a very good case. The 
evidence is strong." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez chose not to testify at the grand jury hearing, his attorney, <PERSON>Richard 
W. Berne</PERSON>, said. 
</P>
<P>
While the grand jury considered the charges, authorities released records 
indicating that one of the club's landlords had been contacted by a fire 
department lieutenant eight months before the blaze and told that a vacate 
order was in effect against the building. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Morris Jaffe</PERSON>, a partner in <ORGANIZATION>Little Peach Realty</ORGANIZATION>, responded that the problem 
"would be taken care of," according to a <DATE>July 28, 1989</DATE>, fire department 
document. 
</P>
<P>
After announcement of the indictment, <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON>, a Cuban immigrant, was returned 
to <ORGANIZATION>Bellevue Hospital</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Berne</PERSON> said he hoped to arrange a psychiatric examination for <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> soon. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, apparently enraged by an ex-girlfriend's rejection, allegedly spilled 
gasoline in the entrance to the Happy Land social club and set it ablaze, 
authorities said. Eighty-seven persons died inside the cramped club, which 
catered largely to immigrants from <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>.

the sentencing were nearly 100 relatives and friends of the victims, many of
whom were immigrants from <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>. They applauded loudly at the sentence.;  
"I hope that he rots in jail," said <PERSON>Maria Clavijo</PERSON>, whose teen-age brother,

pregnant wife.;   The club had been ordered closed for fire safety code
violations months before the blaze.;   "There are many to be blamed, not just
<PERSON>Julio Gonzalez</PERSON> with a 79 IQ who lost his head because he was insulted in front
of his live-in girlfriend," <PERSON>Roberts</PERSON> said.;   The fire spurred city officials
to create a <ORGANIZATION>Social Club Task Force</ORGANIZATION> that closed hundreds of illegal, unsafe
clubs around the city.;   Gasoline and matches; "There never should be a
tragedy such as this, which can be caused by a dollar's worth of gasoline and
two matches," <PERSON>Roberts</PERSON> said.;   The two counts of murder for each death
included one for depraved indifference and one for felony murder. Roberts also
sentenced <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> to 25 years to life for arson and five to 15 years for
assault.;   <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> told the judge he wanted to retain his attorney, <PERSON>Richard

<PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> was insane the night of the fire.;   District Attorney <PERSON>Robert Johnson</PERSON>
also said the state's maximum penalty was not enough. "There should be life
without parole," he said.  </TEXT>

   The man accused of killing 87 people by torching
an illegal social club in a jealous rage was indicted on 178 counts
of murder, arson and other charges <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   A state grand jury indicted <PERSON>Julio Gonzalez</PERSON> on one count of
second-degree murder and one count of murder in the commission of a
felony for each person killed inside the <ORGANIZATION>Happy Land Social Club</ORGANIZATION> in
the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>.
   He also was indicted on two counts of arson and single counts of
attempted murder and assault. The defendant wasn't present when the
indictment was returned.
   Gonzalez, 36, who is due back in court <DATE>April 12</DATE>, could face a
sentence of 25 years to life if convicted on all counts in the
case, said <ORGANIZATION>Assistant District Attorney Eric Warner</ORGANIZATION>. If a judge made
the sentences run consecutively, he could receive a 2,000-year term.
   ``No case is open and shut,'' <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> said. ``We have a very good
case. The evidence is strong.''
   Bronx District Attorney <PERSON>Robert Johnson</PERSON> said it is
``conceivable'' that <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> could be convicted of two murder
counts for each victim, but he said a jury ``probably would have to
choose between the two.''
   Gonzalez, a Cuban immigrant, opted against testifying before the
panel, said his court-appointed attorney, <PERSON>Richard W. Berne</PERSON>.
   While the grand jury considered the charges, authorities
released records indicating that one of the club's landlords was
contacted by a fire lieutenant eight months before the blaze and
told a vacate order was in effect against the building.
   <PERSON>Morris Jaffe</PERSON>, a partner in <ORGANIZATION>Little Peach Realty</ORGANIZATION>, responded that
the problem ``would be taken care of,'' according to a <DATE>July 28,
1989</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Fire Department</ORGANIZATION> document. <PERSON>Jaffe</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jay Weiss</PERSON>, the husband of
actress <PERSON>Kathleen Turner</PERSON>, are partners in <LOCATION>Little Peach</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Jaffe</PERSON> didn't return telephone messages left at his office <DATE>Friday</DATE>
seeking comment on the report.
   <PERSON>Weiss</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jaffe</PERSON> and their company were named in two more
multimillion-dollar negligence lawsuits filed <DATE>Friday</DATE> on behalf of
the families of fire victims. Also named were the club itself; the
building's owner of record, <PERSON>Alex DiLorenzo</PERSON>; and the <LOCATION>City of New
York</LOCATION>.
   One lawsuit asks for <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> in damages; the second asks
for <MONEY>$57 million</MONEY>. Both were filed in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>'s federal court. The
day before, a <MONEY>$510 million</MONEY> lawsuit was filed by the mother of
another victim.
   <DATE>Friday</DATE> was the deadline for an indictment of <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON>, who has
been held on murder and arson charges since <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. He had not
entered a plea in the case because he hadn't been indicted.
   Gonzalez, brought to court earlier in the day on another matter,
was returned to <ORGANIZATION>Bellevue Hospital</ORGANIZATION>, where he was under 24-hour
watch. A shotgun-wielding correction officer accompanied the
suspect back and forth from the court, and no other prisoners are
permitted within 20 feet of him at <LOCATION>Bellevue</LOCATION>, his lawyer said.
   <PERSON>Berne</PERSON> said he hoped to arrange a psychiatric examination for
<PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> soon.
   ``Obviously, one potential avenue of defense is psychiatric,''
said <PERSON>Berne</PERSON>. ``It's always a possible defense. Now I'm looking
through doors, and I will (decide) ... which door I want to walk
through.''
   <PERSON>Berne</PERSON> said <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> was exhausted when they met <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   ``Imagine what he's been through. He's very tired,'' <PERSON>Berne</PERSON> told
reporters at state court in the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>.
   Gonzalez, enraged by a girlfriend's rejection, spilled gasoline
in the entrance to the Happy Land social club early <DATE>Sunday</DATE> and set
it ablaze, authorities said. Eighty-seven patrons died inside the
cramped club, which catered largely to immigrants from <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>.
   His attorney said he was going into the case without any
preconceptions.
   ``All you hear at this stage is the worst of everything. I
wouldn't be a very good lawyer if I rendered a decision on what
I've read in the newspapers,'' <PERSON>Berne</PERSON> said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> was preparing a charter flight to carry more than
40 bodies back to <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION> <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. In <LOCATION>Albany</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>New York
National Guard</ORGANIZATION> said the Honduran government had withdrawn a request
for its help in transporting victims' bodies.
   Six victims were buried <DATE>Friday</DATE> at <ORGANIZATION>St. Raymond's Cemetery</ORGANIZATION> in the
<LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>, and dozens of mourners attended a wake <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME> for
three others.
   One of the few patrons to survive the fire, meanwhile, was
interviewed about the scene at Happy Land when the fire broke out.
   <PERSON>Felipe Figueroa</PERSON> said the club's disc jockey, <PERSON>Ruben Valladares</PERSON>,
was playing a Jamaican reggae song when the club doorman rushed up
the deadly narrow staircase yelling, ``Fuego! fuego!'' or fire,
fire.
   ``Right away, people went crazy,'' he said in the interview with
The <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION>. ``Everybody was running around.''
   He said he made his way down a narrow staircase and out the
door, and then saw <PERSON>Valladares</PERSON>, who was a friend of his, come out in
flames. The disc jockey remains hospitalized with burns over <PERCENT>40
percent</PERCENT> of his body.
   ``My mind can't stop,'' <PERSON>Figueroa</PERSON> said. ``All the screams, all
the noise, and the moment when my friend came out of there
screaming. I can't forget that.''
   Authorities are unsure how many people survived but most
accounts put the number at five or six.

   Officials in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Elizabeth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, ordered a crackdown on
illegal social clubs to prevent a disastrous fire like the one that
killed 87 people in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. But few other cities consider such
clubs to be a problem.
   ``When a tragedy like this occurs, you don't want to ignore
it,'' <PERSON>Daniel Weil</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s building commissioner, said <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   At least 100 non-profit social clubs in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> that are
registered with the secretary of state will be inspected for
hazardous materials and adequate safety systems, <PERSON>Weil</PERSON> said.
   City officials said they also are trying to locate any
unlicensed centers that would be more likely to have code
violations that could lead to a tragedy like the one early <DATE>Sunday</DATE>
in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>Elizabeth</LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON>Thomas G. Dunn</PERSON> said city inspectors would
put at least seven illegal nightclubs out of business in light of
new attention drawn by the <ORGANIZATION>Happy Land Social Club</ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>.
   Two owners of one club were arrested <DATE>Monday</DATE> and about 100
patrons chased from the place, he said.
   In <LOCATION>Paterson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, vice squad Sgt. <PERSON>Michael Recca</PERSON> said three or
four such establishments have been shut down in the last month.
   ``Generally the violations involve illegal alcoholic beverage
sales and with that we find a high incidence of drug sales between
patrons,'' he said.
   Most cities have stiff laws prohibiting selling liquor without a
license.
   ``If you operate in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> without a license, you get put in
jail,'' said <PERSON>E.P. McCracken</PERSON>, regional supervisor of the <ORGANIZATION>Texas
Alcoholic Beverage Commission</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>. ``We don't run our
business in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> like they do in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.''
   <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> officials say there are literally hundreds of clubs
like Happy Land, a firetrap that attracted a largely poor,
immigrant Hispanic crowd.
   The fire _ allegedly set by the former boyfriend of a club
employee _ prompted a new round of promises by city officials to
crack down on clubs that offer dancing and drinking to the city's
poor.
   Illegal clubs have been a nagging headache to fire, building and
liquor officials in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Omaha</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Neb.</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Gary</PERSON> and <LOCATION>East
Chicago</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Lawrence</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>.
   ``We arrest them on misdemeanor charges, and they can open up
again in a week,'' <LOCATION>Omaha</LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON>John Beers</PERSON> said.
   Omaha police found a locked front door and about 220 people in
two small rooms when they raided the <ORGANIZATION>Dirty Dozen Motorcycle Club</ORGANIZATION>
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>. ``If there had been a rush to get out, those people would
have been trampled,'' Beers said.
   In <LOCATION>Lawrence</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, there may be three or four
illegal clubs operating, Fire Chief <PERSON>Raymond Johnson</PERSON> estimated.
   ``We shut them down and two weeks later they open someplace
else,'' <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said. ``I guess it's a very lucrative business.''
   In <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, a prominent club owner said aggressive
crackdowns on unsafe or illegal nightclubs have failed to stop chic
underground clubs from flourishing and evading detection by fire
officials.
   ``I myself go to these places,'' said <PERSON>Steve Banerjee</PERSON>, who owns
legal Chippendales clubs on both coasts. ``It's the whole theory of
do something you shouldn't do. You think you are part of the `in'
crowd, the `aware' crowd.'' Many big-city officials say they seldom
or never see such establishments.
   ``That's bootlegging in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and we would shut them down,''
said <PERSON>Randy Yarbrough</PERSON>, assistant administrator for the <ORGANIZATION>Texas
Alcoholic Beverage Commission</ORGANIZATION>. Officials in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, were among those saying they
didn't believe their cities had a problem with illegal clubs.
   Some officials hoped news of the Happy Land disaster could boost
support for inspection efforts for legal and illegal clubs alike.
   Said Lawrence Fire Chief Johnson: ``Now they will use this as an
example.''

   Distant from <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>'s shining skyscrapers
lies the darker side of <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> real estate, a place where
buildings crumble from neglect, where drugs are dealt, where
unlicensed bars sometimes turn into infernos.
   The Happy Land social club in the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>, where 87 revelers were
killed <DATE>March 25</DATE> in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>'s deadliest fire in 79 years, was
a firetrap like hundreds of other illegal clubs in poorer
neighborhoods. And the city knew it.
   But these bars are as profitable as they are dangerous, experts
say, and that is why they flourish in the shadows _ poorly
regulated, operated on the cheap, tolerated by landlords seeking
what cash they can find.
   ``You own a building. You can't rent it. All of a sudden a guy
comes along and offers you <MONEY>$2,000</MONEY> a month for it,'' said <PERSON>Barry
Levites</PERSON>, a real estate manager and former president of the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>
borough's <ORGANIZATION>Board of Realtors</ORGANIZATION>. ``Ninety percent of the time, nobody
even asks what he wants it for.''
   That passes for a business ethic on the unglamorous side of the
block.
   ``There is a tendency to find things that you don't expect''
from tenants, said <PERSON>Morris Sopher</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> owner listed as having
two illegal social clubs in his buildings. ``They may open a
grocery store up front. But then they make a partition 40 feet back
and they start having gatherings.''
   ``Say I rent to a guy and he starts doing illegal things,'' said
<PERSON>James J. Houlihan</PERSON>, another real estate owner with some holdings in
poorer areas. ``How am I supposed to be responsible for it?''
   But some landlords may share the blame. While some clubs are
concealed, many illegal nightspots operate openly, with a sign out
front and music blaring. Some are centers of drug traffic.
Prostitutes frequent others.
   ``A lot of landlords will rent to unsavory characters without
getting directly involved, without wanting to know what's going on,
making a lot of money and opening their eyes only when the police
come along,'' said <PERSON>Douglas Kellner</PERSON>, a veteran tenant rights lawyer.
``Then they self-righteously take steps to clean it up.''
   He said landlords in poor neighborhoods include slumlords who
collect what rental cash they can while allowing buildings to
deteriorate, small-time owners unschooled in building management,
and real estate companies that provide minimum service while
seeking the maximum profit.
   Perhaps the biggest owner is the city, which takes over
buildings for unpaid taxes. Police records say social clubs operate
even in some city-owned buildings _ by one estimate, more than 50.
   In some cases where private owners remain, ``the rents are
extortionate,'' said <PERSON>Jane Benedict</PERSON>, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION>Metropolitan
Council on Housing</ORGANIZATION>, a tenant rights group. ``But there's no place
else for the people to go.'' The city does not regulate commercial
rents.
   The Happy Land rented for <MONEY>$1,950</MONEY> a month, easy money to recover
in a club charging a <MONEY>$5</MONEY> entrance fee and <MONEY>$3</MONEY> per drink. To maximize
profit, many clubs pour cheap booze from refilled bottles.
   ``Anybody who thinks that because a bottle says <PERSON>Dewar</PERSON>'s he's
getting <PERSON>Dewar</PERSON>'s ought to go to the hospital for a mental
examination,'' said Inspector <PERSON>Frank Biehler</PERSON>, commander of the
<ORGANIZATION>Police Department's Social Club Task Force</ORGANIZATION>.
   The Happy Land lacked a fire exit and first-floor sprinkler
system; once flames blocked the front door, there was no way out.
The city ordered the club closed in <DATE>November 1988</DATE> for fire code
violations, and it apparently closed for a time, but then reopened.
   The city said it sent its vacate order to the building's owner,
<PERSON>Alex DiLorenzo III</PERSON>, and that a firefighter discussed the issue with
<PERSON>Morris Jaffe</PERSON>, a real estate manager who leased a block of buildings
including the Happy Land from <PERSON>DiLorenzo</PERSON>. Lawyers for <ORGANIZATION>DiLorenzo</ORGANIZATION> and
<PERSON>Jaffe</PERSON> did not return calls.
   DiLorenzo is part heir to one of the city's largest real estate
fortunes.
   <PERSON>Levites</PERSON>, the real estate manager, called it unusual for someone
of <ORGANIZATION>DiLorenzo</ORGANIZATION>'s prominence to own property in impoverished areas.
``They can play the big game in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>,'' he said. ``Why bother
with something like this?''
   More common are owners such as <PERSON>Sopher</PERSON>, who said he owns nearly
60 Bronx commercial buildings, and others who own just one or
several properties.
   <PERSON>Sopher</PERSON> said he never was notified by the city that it had found
illegal clubs in two of his buildings, and that he learned of it
only last week when reporters called. He said he would move to
evict them, but complained that court protections for tenants can
delay evictions a year or more.
   ``My responsibility is to come around, which I do, bother them,
harass them. I don't have any police powers. I can go to court, but
the courts are totally consumer and tenant oriented,'' he said.
``It's almost impossible to get out a bad tenant.''
   <PERSON>Sopher</PERSON> and his colleague also laid some of the blame for illegal
clubs on the city, which they said failed to enforce the vacate
orders that help rid them of unwanted tenants. Inspectors rarely
return, they said; police and firefighters never check up.
   Happy Land had a sign in front, complete with a smiling ``happy
face'' symbol. ``You're going to tell me the cops in the area
didn't know this was going on?'' <PERSON>Levites</PERSON> said. ``The Fire
Department didn't know what was going on? They didn't notice?
   ``Who's supposed to police these people? Well, the blame can go
all over.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>'s government has been branded the
largest single landlord of illegal social clubs.
   At least 52 social clubs listed by the city as ``nuisance''
establishments are on city-owned property, according to reports
published in weekend newspapers.
   A police crackdown on the clubs started after 87 people, mostly
Hondurans, died <DATE>March 25</DATE> in an arson fire at the illegal <ORGANIZATION>Happy Land
Social Club</ORGANIZATION> in the Tremont section of the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>.
   The bodies of 48 of the victims arrived <DATE>Sunday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION> for
burial.
   ``Most of them went to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> with high hopes, and
they came back dead. We are very sad,'' said President <PERSON>Rafael
Leonardo Callejas</PERSON>, who joined dozens of mourning relatives at the
airport at <LOCATION>San Pedro Sula</LOCATION>.
   Wakes and funerals were scheduled in 11 towns in northern
<LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Sunday</DATE> that police documents list at
least 52 clubs as ``nuisance'' establishments in properties owned
by the city, including two in city housing projects. That would
make the city the largest single landlord of such clubs.
   In late editions <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Daily News</ORGANIZATION> reported that as many
as 46 illegal clubs are located in city-owned residential
buildings. It based its report on a review of <ORGANIZATION>Buildings Department</ORGANIZATION>
and real estate records as well as inspections by city agencies.
   <PERSON>Lee Jones</PERSON>, a spokesman for Mayor <PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON>, said the city
inherited the clubs along with vast numbers of tenants and
abandoned buildings.
   ``Is it embarrassing?'' Jones said. ``It's something we're going
to have to deal with.''

   A man charged in an illegal nightspot fire that
killed 87 people pleaded innocent today to 174 counts of murder and
other charges.
   <PERSON>Julio Gonzalez</PERSON>, 36, was guarded by four armed court officers as
he was arraigned before <PERSON>Judge Burton R. Roberts</PERSON> in trial-level
state <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>.
   Gonzalez, who spoke to the court through a Spanish translator,
mumbled ``no culpable'' when asked how he pleaded on the charges.
   The judge told attorneys that under state law, <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> could
serve only a single 25 years-to-life sentence even if convicted on
all charges. The law stipulates his sentences would have to run
concurrently, <PERSON>Roberts</PERSON> said.
   Gonzalez is accused of setting a fire that trapped revelers
inside the tiny <ORGANIZATION>Happy Land Social Club</ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>.
   Authorities charge that the Cuban immigrant, enraged by the
rejection of a former girlfriend who worked at the club, bought <MONEY>$1</MONEY>
worth of gasoline, spilled it in the illegal club's doorway and set
it aflame. Only five people escaped the cramped club following the
<TIME>4 a.m.</TIME> fire, including the girlfriend.
   Court-appointed defense attorney <PERSON>Richard W. Berne</PERSON> said <DATE>today</DATE> he
had not decided whether to use an insanity defense for his client,
although he had indicated earlier that was a possibility.
   <PERSON>Berne</PERSON> said he plans to ask for a dismissal of all charges
against <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> because the lawyer was not given access to a
videotaped confession by his client when the case was submitted to
the grand jury.
   Gonzalez was indicted <DATE>March 30</DATE> on 174 counts of murder, two
counts of arson and single counts of attempted murder and assault.
He was charged with two separate murder counts for each of the
victims killed in the social club blaze.
   The club lacked proper permits and did not have adequate exits
and sprinkling systems.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Arrest Warrant Was Outstanding For Happy Land Owner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An arrest warrant was issued last year for the
owner of the building that housed a club where 87 people died by
fire, but he never was arrested, city records show.
   A <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> criminal judge issued the warrant after the owner, <PERSON>Alex
DiLorenzo III</PERSON>, failed to appear for a hearing on fire code
violations at the illegal social club, The <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> reported
in today's editions.
   The warrant for <PERSON>DiLorenzo</PERSON>, who is an heir to one of the city's
largest real estate fortunes, was low priority and never was
enforced, police said.
   ``We are interested in all warrants,'' said Lt. <PERSON>Raymond
O'Donnell</PERSON>, a police spokesman. ``But we are more interested in
going after the guy who has committed a murder over a guy who has
violations in a building.''
   Of 100,000 yearly arrest warrants, those for building code
violations are among the lowest priority, <PERSON>O'Donnell</PERSON> said.
   The warrant for <PERSON>DiLorenzo</PERSON> was issued <DATE>Feb. 3, 1989</DATE>, by <ORGANIZATION>Bronx
Criminal Court</ORGANIZATION> <PERSON>Judge James E. Robinson</PERSON>. The violations listed in
the warrant carried a fine of up to <MONEY>$5,000</MONEY> and 90 days in jail.
   The club lacked adequate sprinklers, emergency lighting and an
assembly permit for the entertainment of more than 75 people.
   A task force created by the city in <DATE>1988</DATE> after another fatal
social club fire inspected Happy Land on <DATE>Nov. 20, 1988</DATE>, and ordered
it closed.
   DiLorenzo has not returned telephone calls placed to his office
over the past several days, the newspaper said.
   The man who allegedly set the fire, <PERSON>Julio Gonzalez</PERSON>, was being
held in the psychiatric unit in the prison wing at <ORGANIZATION>Bellevue
Hospital</ORGANIZATION>.
   A friend of <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON>'s, <PERSON>Juana Ortiz</PERSON>, told the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Post he
was stricken with grief when told that one of his best friends died
in the <DATE>March 25</DATE> fire at <ORGANIZATION>Happy Land Social Club</ORGANIZATION>.
   The friend, identified only as <ORGANIZATION>Ramon</ORGANIZATION>, had comforted <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON>
after he was evicted by the club's bouncer before the fire, <PERSON>Ms.
Ortiz</PERSON> said.
   She said when she told Gonzlalez that <PERSON>Ramon</PERSON> had died, he shouted
``Oh my God! Please forgive me!'' and broke down sobbing, the
newspaper reported in today's editions.
   <PERSON>Ortiz</PERSON> said <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> is resigned to punishment and spends his day
reading a Spanish-language Bible.

   Wails and cries echoed from inside a school
where friends and relatives gathered to confirm their worst fears _
that one of the 87 who died in a <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> fire was their daughter,
husband, lover.
   Many emerged pale and distraught from <ORGANIZATION>Public School</ORGANIZATION> 67 after
identifying dead family members in photos.
   A Honduran flag was draped over a fence outside the school; many
of those who died were immigrants from <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>.
   ``They tried to live the American dream: to get a job and make
something of themselves,'' said <PERSON>Cheo Garcia</PERSON>, a former patron of the
Happy Land social club.
   ``They all dreamed of returning home _ but with more money,''
said <PERSON>Miguel Reyes</PERSON>, coach of <ORGANIZATION>Club Deportivo Adrana</ORGANIZATION>, an amateur
soccer team.
   Reyes counted team members among the dead: <PERSON>Orvin Garbutt</PERSON>, 22,
<PERSON>Bagoberto Echeverri</PERSON>, 18, and a third player, all from <LOCATION>Puerto
Cortez</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>.
   They lived in <LOCATION>East Tremont</LOCATION>, a neighborhood populated by
Hondurans, Dominicans, <LOCATION>Puerto Ricans</LOCATION> and Ecuadorans.
   The area is blighted by poor housing, drugs, unemployment and
truancy. Graffitti marred the rolled-down security gates on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>
as trash blew down streets and across vacant lots. A rat lay dead
on the sidewalk.
   Bronx Borough President <PERSON>Fernando Ferrer</PERSON> said the neighborhood
did not have an especially high crime rate. But some young men were
snorting cocaine in full view of police officers.
   Residents are trying to renovate the impoverished area, said the
Rev. <PERSON>Ruben Diaz</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Christian Community Benevolent Association</ORGANIZATION>,
a Protestant group.
   On <DATE>Saturday</DATE> nights, some took a break and flocked to an illegal
social club called Happy Land.
   ``We have to try hard to close these places. They are killing
our people,'' <PERSON>Diaz</PERSON> said. ``Sometimes we say, let them have it
because they have nothing better. Now we have to say, 'What is more
important, to have a good time or to stay alive?'''
   About 1,000 people gathered outside Happy Land, next to a union
hiring hall where the victims' bodies were assembled in rows on the
floor.
   Loved ones were allowed through police lines to look at the
photos at <LOCATION>P.S.</LOCATION> 67.
   ``We're looking for friends and relatives and nobody's telling
us anything,'' complained <PERSON>Rosemary Green</PERSON>, who believed her
sister-in-law and cousin had gone to Happy Land.
   ``It's a slow process,'' said the Rev. <PERSON>A.B. Duncans</PERSON>, pastor of
the nearby <ORGANIZATION>First Glorious Church Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, who was assisting and
counseling some of the bereaved.
   One woman collapsed on the sidewalk outside the school and had
to be helped inside, where her son's picture was displayed with
those of other victims.
   <PERSON>Jorge Pineda</PERSON> lost five friends, all from <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>.
   A friend called <PERSON>Pineda</PERSON>'s apartment at <TIME>8 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, and asked
his wife if he was going, as usual, to the <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> dance.
   Pineda's wife hung up; she didn't approve of the place. Eight
hours later, <PERSON>Pineda</PERSON> was identifying his friends' bodies from police
photos.
   ``I'm the only friend they had,'' he said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The lawyer who filed incorporation papers for
the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> social club where 87 people died in a fire is a city
police lieutenant who is now himself under investigation, according
to a published report.
   Lt. <PERSON>Primo Flores</PERSON> was moonlighting as a lawyer when he listed the
Happy Land club as a not-for-profit corporation in the <DATE>1988</DATE> papers,
The <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> reported in <DATE>Thursday</DATE> editions.
   Nothing suggests <PERSON>Flores</PERSON> knew the club would sell liquor
illegally and operate in violation of city orders that it close
because of building violations, the <ORGANIZATION>Times</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Police told the Times that the investigation is aimed at
determining whether <PERSON>Flores</PERSON> adhered to departmental requirements to
disclose his outside business activities and whether he had
committed any wrongdoing in his work for the club.
   Flores' role in setting up the club has been under investigation
by the <ORGANIZATION>Police Department's Internal Affairs Division</ORGANIZATION> since shortly
after the <DATE>March 25</DATE> fire, the <ORGANIZATION>Times</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The 48-year-old <PERSON>Flores</PERSON>, a policeman since <DATE>1967</DATE>, works in the
<ORGANIZATION>Police Department</ORGANIZATION>'s Advocate office, which prosecutes departmental
charges against police officers accused of breaking regulations.
   Flores did not return calls requesting comment, the <ORGANIZATION>Times</ORGANIZATION> said.
   A Cuban immigrant, <PERSON>Julio Gonzalez</PERSON>, has been charged with setting
the deadly blaze after a dispute with his girlfriend, who worked at
the club as a coat checker.
   The club had been operating in violation of vacate orders issued
after city inspectors discovered there was no second exit, no fire
alarms and inadequate sprinklers.

   Nightmares jolt <PERSON>Ruben Valladarez</PERSON> awake in his
hospital bed, tormenting him with thoughts of friends who died in a
place called Happy Land.
   ``I feel better,'' he said <DATE>Friday</DATE>. ``Only I got a little bad
dreams.''
   Valladarez, the disc jockey at the illegal <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> social club, is
one of a few survivors of the arson fire that killed 87 people
<DATE>March 25</DATE>. He was critically injured, with burns over <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> of
his body.
   In his first interview, <PERSON>Valladarez</PERSON> described the ordeal
haltingly, with tears. He lost friends, and at least three cousins,
he said, naming them with a tortured face. He cannot explain why he
was the one who lived.
   He was spinning records in the back, on the second floor, about
<TIME>4 a.m.</TIME> ``Somebody screamed _ `Fire!''' Valladarez recalled. ``I put
the lights on. I said into the microphone, ``Everybody get out!
I've got a fire!''
   There was no emergency exit at the crowded club, no emergency
lights, no sprinkler system, not even a window to jump from.
Valladarez was one of only two people to escape from the second
floor. Four or more escaped from the first floor.
   First he crossed to the front of the second-floor dance area,
looking for a friend. ``I said, `We have to get out, man.''' He
descended a narrow front stairway to the first floor bar. It was
already filled with flames.
   ``Downstairs is fire. I run downstairs,'' said <PERSON>Valladarez</PERSON>, 26, a
native of Trujillo, <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>, for whom English is a second language.
   People there were running about in panic. ``They scream.
Everybody going to the door, pushing the door. It's locked.''
   Valladarez thought of his wife, <PERSON>Frances</PERSON>, and their 2-year-old
daughter, <PERSON>Nadine</PERSON>. He ran into the flames, searching for the sole
open door; there was no other choice. ``I had to go,'' he said.
   When Valladarez reached the street his clothes were on fire.
People threw water on him. He suffered third-degree burns on his
forearms and hands, second-degree burns on his legs and face.
   When his wife saw him at <ORGANIZATION>Bronx Municipal Hospital</ORGANIZATION> she could not
recognize him.
   Twelve days and three operations later, <ORGANIZATION>Valladarez</ORGANIZATION> remains in
critical condition in the burn ward. He may need more surgery, and
two to three months of hospitalization, and nine to 18 months of
rehabilitation. The burn ward chief, <PERSON>Dr. Steven Blau</PERSON>, said it is
too soon to say whether Valladarez will regain the use of his hands.
   ``His attitude is very good. He's a fighter,'' <PERSON>Blau</PERSON> said. ``And
his attitude is very important, because everything he has to do in
terms of recovery will hurt him.''
   Valladarez's face is raw, blistered under the eyebrows and on
his lips, coated with salve. A tube feeds oxygen into his nose. Two
needles provide intravenous fluid. His arms are heavily bandaged,
one suspended from a stand to keep swelling down. He is hooked up
to a heart monitor.
   He said he feels anguish for loved ones who died and anger at
<PERSON>Julio Gonzalez</PERSON>, the man accused of setting the fire to punish an
ex-girlfriend who worked there.
   ``He has to go to jail. Fifty years _ or 200,'' <PERSON>Valladarez</PERSON> said.
``In my country, this man is die.''
   Valladarez, who worked at the Happy Land for two years, said he
never had considered the danger of fire there.
   His advice now: Stay away. ``Don't go no more. Because every
social club in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> is bad.''

   Atop the rickety wooden staircase, the dance
floor trembled under heels tapping and shuffling to the beat that
shifted from salsa to calypso. Disco lights glittered on silk
clothes, <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>'s finest.
   Suddenly, flames roaring in the bottom floor turned the top room
into a blast furnace. Within seconds, superheated gases and thick
smoke had silenced the place. Only a handful had escaped.
   The <MONEY>$5</MONEY> cover was a small price to pay for a night out in the
poor Latino community of <LOCATION>East Tremont</LOCATION>, near the <LOCATION>Bronx Zoo</LOCATION>. People
dressed up nice and they partied hard.
   ``The whole floor moved with the music, it was sleazy and very,
very hot,'' said <PERSON>Denise Garcia</PERSON>, 20. ``People liked to go there and
show off.''
   Lately, the patrons say, the mostly Honduran clientele had
expanded to include other Hispanics. Sometimes a gun or a knife
flashed, or someone whipped out a crack vial.
   Three of the victims played amateur soccer for a <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> team
named after one of the big teams in <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>, where many of the
youths hoped to return some day.
   ``They all dreamed of returning with more money, they were full
of Hispanic machismo,'' said their coach, <PERSON>Miguel Reyes</PERSON>.
   At about <TIME>3:15 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, there was a ruckus downstairs in the
tiny entryway. A bearded Cuban patron was harassing his former
girlfriend who worked at the club, and a bouncer was called over.
   ``Don't push me, don't push me,'' the patron said, according to
witnesses. And then: ``I'll be back.''
   The man identified as <PERSON>Julio Gonzalez</PERSON>, 36, angered by his
rejection by ex-girlfriend <PERSON>Lydia Feliciano</PERSON>, fetched gasoline from a
service station, according to police.
   Then he stood at the club's exit and splashed the fuel on the
floor and wall inside. Then he struck a match.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Happy Land Social Club</ORGANIZATION>'s name referred to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, regular
patrons said, a place of hope for the young immigrants who
frequented the club.
   When the fire allegedly lighted by <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> took, fire
investigators said, the ground floor became an inferno; the
windowless second floor, where all but 18 of the 87 victims were
found, was a gas chamber, with wall-to-wall bodies.
   The few survivors included <PERSON>Ms. Feliciano</PERSON>; <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON>, under
suicide watch at a psychiatric ward, is charged with 87 murders.
   Long after dawn, a stream of corpses left the Happy Land on
stretchers, covered with white sheets.
   Some died instantly. Rescue workers told of finding victims with
glasses in their hands. Others were sitting at the bar, their legs
still wound around bar stools.
   ``Lungs are seared by hot gases, and it becomes impossible to
take a second breath,'' said <PERSON>Dr. Alexander Kuehl</PERSON>, director of
emergency medicine at <ORGANIZATION>New York Hospital</ORGANIZATION>. ``And when there is not
enough oxygen coming in to feed the fire, you get carbon monoxide,
which can kill you in a minute.''
   ``It was a huge rush of superheated poison gas. We call it a
flashover, it is instant. If you are breathing in, it is deadly,''
said <PERSON>Zachary Goldfarb</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Emergency Medical Service</ORGANIZATION> deputy chief of
operations.
   Some victims, facing the wall of fire that came from downstairs,
frantically tried to escape. Bodies were piled four deep by the
upstairs door, a testament to their desperation.
   ``You can't imagine what went on in there; you can't imagine
what these people did to try to survive,'' said firefighter <PERSON>Dennis
Devlin</PERSON>.
   ``There was one woman who looked to be holding onto her
boyfriend for dear life,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Emergency Medical Services</ORGANIZATION> worker
<PERSON>Kerry Naughton</PERSON>, ``There was a man lying over a woman, as if he was
trying to shield her with his body.''
   There was no sprinkler system on the ground floor. The
sprinklers on the second floor discharged after 87 people were
dead, authorities said. Firefighters arrived in a few minutes, but
there were no screams, no cries.

Hundreds of mourners, many weeping, others calling for revenge, offered their 
prayers at a funeral home <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> for 17 victims of the city's deadliest fire 
in 79 years. 
</P>
<P>
Officials, meanwhile, began preparations for a grim airlift of the dead to 
their Honduran homeland. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> has asked the <ORGANIZATION>New York National Guard</ORGANIZATION> to help transport the 
bodies, an aide to Gov. <PERSON>Mario M. Cuomo</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
A funeral Mass at <ORGANIZATION>St. Joseph's Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> drew 1,500 people, and 1,000 
others who could not get in stood outside the church. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, outside the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> funeral home across the street from <LOCATION>St. Joseph</LOCATION>'s, 
the street was crowded with people waiting to pay their respects. The dead were 
among 87 people killed early <DATE>Sunday</DATE> inside the Happy Land social club. 
</P>
<P>
Three women fainted as the crowd waited to enter. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jose Alvarez</PERSON>, mourning his brother <PERSON>Denny</PERSON>, 22, left the <ORGANIZATION>Rivera Funeral Home</ORGANIZATION> 
sobbing. 
</P>
<P>
On the steps of the church, <PERSON>Denny</PERSON>'s father, <PERSON>Pedro</PERSON>, tearfully vented his rage at 
<PERSON>Julio Gonzalez</PERSON>, 36, the man accused of setting the fatal fire in a quarrel with 
an ex-girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
"They ought to take him and give him a public hanging," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, family members of the victims met with <ORGANIZATION>American Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> 
officials at a public school near the burned-out red brick building to receive 
the belongings each victim carried or wore when the fire struck. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the school, <PERSON>Carlos Pena</PERSON> clutched a manila envelope that held a watch, a 
set of keys, and some cash -- things his brother <PERSON>Eli</PERSON>, 26, had with him early 
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> at the doomed Happy Land club. 
</P>
<P>
The watch came with <ORGANIZATION>Eli</ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Carlos</PERSON> said the timepiece would now 
be his. "It means a lot, a reminder," he said.

   Hondurans jammed phone lines <DATE>Monday</DATE>
seeking news of relatives in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> following a weekend fire
that killed 87 people at a <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> social club.
   The government expressed regret over the death of the victims,
most of them Hondurans and Dominicans, and instructed its
ambassador to gather information for relatives.
   Gov. <PERSON>Dylia Chirinos de Diaz</PERSON> said most of the Hondurans were from
coastal towns in <LOCATION>Colon</LOCATION> province.
   ``The majority of them traveled to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in search
of a better way of life,'' said <PERSON>Edith Fajardo</PERSON>, a Honduran consular
official in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman <PERSON>Eugenio Castro</PERSON> said the government
was studying the possibility of sending a Honduran air force plane
to bring back the bodies of the victims of the fire at the Happy
Land social club.
   <PERSON>Julio Cesar Castro</PERSON> of the northwestern city of <PERSON>San Pedro Sula</PERSON>
said his 17-year-old daughter, <PERSON>Janeta Mercedes Castro</PERSON>, died in the
early morning blaze.
   ``My daughter traveled to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> in search of better horizons,
to save money and then return to her home in <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>, but she only
found death,'' he said.
   She had been in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> for two years and was a maid for an
American family, <PERSON>Castro</PERSON> said. He said she leaves a 2-year-old son
who lives with him.
   A Cuban man thrown out of the club after quarreling with his
ex-girlfriend was arraigned <DATE>Monday</DATE> on arson and murder charges.
   Hondurans seeking information on victims and the welfare of
relatives crowded into telephone offices in <LOCATION>Colon</LOCATION> province.
   Radio stations broadcast almost continual news of the fire and
said they were receiving streams of calls seeking information on
victims. Stations are a major means of communication in the
country, which has a <PERCENT>57 percent</PERCENT> illiteracy rate.
   In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Miguel Reyes</PERSON>, coach of the <ORGANIZATION>Club Deportivo Adrana</ORGANIZATION>
amateur soccer team, said three of its players, all from <LOCATION>Puerto
Cortes</LOCATION>, a northwestern coastal town, were among the dead.
   ``They all dreamed of returning home _ but with more money,''
<PERSON>Reyes</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Reynaldo Colon Nunez</PERSON>, a Honduran living in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, told the
<LOCATION>Tegucigalpa</LOCATION> station <ORGANIZATION>Radio America</ORGANIZATION> by telephone that he normally
would have been at the club himself.
   ``Nearly every <DATE>Sunday</DATE> I went to Happy Land to dance but
yesterday I didn't want to,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The city's new commissioner of Hispanic affairs
operates an illegal social club that was ordered closed last year
and again <DATE>Monday</DATE> for safety and fire violations, city records show.
   Commissioner <PERSON>William Nieves</PERSON> runs the club, <LOCATION>El Caney</LOCATION>, in a
building that is supposed to be used as a factory, according to
city <ORGANIZATION>Buildings Department</ORGANIZATION> documents, the <ORGANIZATION>Daily News</ORGANIZATION> reported.
   Nieves, appointed to the <MONEY>$65,000-a-year</MONEY> commissioner's post
<DATE>Friday</DATE>, denies <ORGANIZATION>El Caney</ORGANIZATION> is a social club, calling it a ``place for
cultural events,'' but acknowledges knowing about fire and safety
code violations cited last year, the newspaper said in a story
published today.
   An ``order to vacate'' sign was posted on the club door <DATE>Monday</DATE>
by a mayoral task force that is cracking down on illegal
establishments in the wake of a fire at an illegal <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> club
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> in which 87 people died.
   <PERSON>Nieves</PERSON> said he planned to give up his job as operator of <ORGANIZATION>El
Caney</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``It's not a bar or a social club. It's a place for cultural
events. ... When we have parties, they can serve liquor when they
have their own private activities. But you can't call that a bar,''
he said.
   <PERSON>Nieves</PERSON> said he had been under the impression repairs ``were the
responsibility of the landlord, not me.''
   The landlord, R&amp;R Real Estate, was unaware <PERSON>Nieves</PERSON> was operating
a social club there, the newspaper said.
   A summons issued by the <ORGANIZATION>Buildings Department</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>last April</DATE> cited
operation of an illegal gathering place without permits, lack of
emergency lighting, missing exit signs and unilluminated exit
signs. The summons cited a certificate of occupancy that lists the
building's function as a factory.

   A stunned neighborhood near the Bronx Zoo tried
to comprehend why many of its sons and daughters perished inside a
social club in the city's third worst fire.
   ``I told my son not to go there. He told me he wasn't going
there,'' said <PERSON>Eledia Alvarez</PERSON>, whose 22-year-old son <PERSON>Danny</PERSON> was one
of the 87 people who died in the fire early <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   Police cars and fire rescue trucks were still parked <DATE>Monday</DATE> near
the <ORGANIZATION>Happy Land Social Club</ORGANIZATION>, with its incongruous name and yellow
``happy face'' above a fire-blackened entrance and a single barred
window.
   Several hundred people loitering behind the blue police
sawhorses shook their heads or shrugged when asked if they knew
<PERSON>Julio Gonzalez</PERSON>, 36. He is alleged to have poured gasoline in the
doorway of the illegal nightspot and then set it afire, trapping
partyers in an upstairs dance area. Most suffocated before they
could flee down the two narrow stairways.
   Classes were underway as usual at <ORGANIZATION>Public School 67</ORGANIZATION>, which on
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> served as the clearing house for families and friends to
view police photographs of the victims. On <DATE>Monday</DATE>, a task force of
seven city, state and private agencies was still using part of the
building to help relatives make funeral arrangements.
   The city offered <MONEY>$900</MONEY> to survivors who need burial assistance,
and the state <ORGANIZATION>Crime Victims Board</ORGANIZATION> will pay up to <MONEY>$2,500</MONEY>.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Alvarez</PERSON> was among some 200 relatives and friends who
returned for that purpose. They spoke with disgust about how the
Happy Land was able to operate despite having been ordered by city
authorities to close, and with sorrow that some people continued to
patronize it despite its reputation as an unsafe place.
   <PERSON>Rene J. Mena</PERSON>, 63, said his 30-year-old son, <PERSON>Rene Jr.</PERSON>, the oldest
of 10 children and himself the father of three, had invited him to
go out on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   ``I told him I didn't want to go to that place. That is a very
dangerous place, and I'm not going there.''
   <PERSON>Rene Jr.</PERSON> died in the fire.

   The bodies of 50 of the 87 people killed in a
fire at an illegal Bronx social club were loaded onto a cargo plane
at <LOCATION>Kennedy Airport</LOCATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> for a late-night flight to <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>,
a nation in mourning.
   At a brief memorial service in the huge hangar to which the
caskets had come, some in hearses, others stacked on flatbed
trucks, Deputy Mayor <PERSON>Bill Lynch</PERSON> said <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> would ``do all
possible to make sure this will never happen again.''
   ``These young people came to this great city of ours seeking
hope and opportunity, and now they leave like this,'' <PERSON>Lynch</PERSON> said,
gesturing toward the long row of caskets. ``The bodies lying here
before us say we've got to do more. We've got to do more to make
sure this doesn't happen again.''
   Honduran President <PERSON>Rafael Leonardo Callejas</PERSON> planned to head a
government delegation receiving the bodies when the plane arrived
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>. After an airport Mass, Honduran air force planes
and helicopters will take the remains to 12 locations in the
country, said <PERSON>Nahum Valladares</PERSON>, Honduran information minister.
   In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, police continued their crackdown on the hundreds of
unlicensed social clubs, or bars, which dot the city's poorer
neighborhoods.
   Police said they visited 261 locations late <DATE>Friday</DATE> and early
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> and found only 65 clubs open. They issued 29 orders to
vacate the premises, 57 summonses and 80 violation notices. On
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, they visited 89 club sites and found 74 closed.
   Most club operators closed down before they were shut down,
according to a neighborhood liquor store owner who has supplied
liquor to social clubs. He spoke to <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> on the
condition of anonymity.
   The retailer said that by <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> he had not heard from
any of the clubs that normally contact him during the day to place
orders.
   Because they are not licensed, social clubs cannot obtain liquor
from wholesalers and must buy from retailers. Such sales often
violate state rules limiting the amount of liquor any one person
can buy retail at one time.
   Their defenders say the clubs fill a need. <PERSON>Julio Medina</PERSON>, who was
at a <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> club that was raided <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, admitted that
the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> fire had worried him. ``But this is all there is,'' he
said. ``People cannot afford anything else.''
   A <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> grand jury has charged <PERSON>Julio Gonzalez</PERSON> with murder for
allegedly etting the fire that devastated the Happy Land club a
week ago.
   Police say <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON>, enraged by a former girlfriend's rejection,
spilled a dollar's worth of gasoline in the entrance to the club
and set it ablaze. Conviction on a murder charge carries a maximum
penalty of 25 years to life.
   Gonzalez is being held in <LOCATION>Bellevue Hospital</LOCATION>, in isolation and
under 24-hour watch. The former girlfriend, an employee at the
club, was one of the few to escape.
   Six victims were buried <DATE>Friday</DATE> at <ORGANIZATION>St. Raymond's Cemetery</ORGANIZATION> in the
<LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>, and dozens of mourners attended a wake <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME> for
three others. Other funerals were held <DATE>Saturday</DATE> before the airlift
to <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>.
   The DC-8 scheduled to take the 50 bodies to <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION> was
chartered by the <ORGANIZATION>American Red Cross</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Ed Hardy</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION>
spokesman, said about 100 relatives of fire victims also were being
flown to <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> expense on regular commercial
flights.
   <PERSON>Hardy</PERSON> said an exact time for the cargo plane to leave <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON>
had not been set. The flight takes about five hours, and the plane

   Authorities had warned the owners of the
building that housed the <ORGANIZATION>Happy Land Social Club</ORGANIZATION> that it was riddled
with violations, including no sprinkler system on the first floor,
where the fire started.
   Notice of the fire code violations, which also included an
illegally added-on second floor, no second exit and no fire alarms,
were sent to <PERSON>Alex DiLorenzo III</PERSON>, the owner, building Commissioner
<PERSON>Charles Smith Jr.</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>The New York Times</ORGANIZATION> in today's editions.
   DiLorenzo leased the building to <PERSON>Jay Weiss</PERSON>, husband of actress
<PERSON>Kathleen Turner</PERSON>, who in turn leased the building to club manager
<PERSON>Elias Colon</PERSON>. Colon was among the 87 people who died in the fire
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   Normally, the violations report would have been forwarded by the
owner to the leaseholder, but <PERSON>Weiss</PERSON>' attorneys said they never
received a formal notice of the violations. They would not comment
on whether they knew of them.
   Prosecutors are looking into whether the building's landlords or
owners might bear responsibility for the fire. Police alleged it
was set by <PERSON>Julio Gonzalez</PERSON>, in a jealous rage against his
ex-girlfriend, who worked at the club.
   The club was incorporated in <DATE>1988</DATE> as a not-for-profit
corporation for ``the purpose of providing for members
entertainment, sport, recreation and amusement of all kinds,'' the
Times reported.
   The incorporation papers appeared to enable Colon to avoid
filing state and city income tax forms, the <ORGANIZATION>Times</ORGANIZATION> said.
   <PERSON>Weiss</PERSON> had been trying to evict the <ORGANIZATION>Happy Land Social Club</ORGANIZATION> for
non-payment of rent since <DATE>September</DATE>, according to <PERSON>Weiss</PERSON>' lawyer,
<PERSON>Roger Boyle</PERSON>.
   A lease signed by Happy Land on <DATE>Oct. 7, 1987</DATE>, called for monthly
rents of <MONEY>$1,500</MONEY> for the first year, <MONEY>$1,650</MONEY> for the second and
<MONEY>$1,950</MONEY> for the third.
   Court papers concerning the rent squabble show that on <DATE>Feb. 15,
1989</DATE>, a process server stuck a notice on the door of Happy Land
demanding <MONEY>$3,074</MONEY> within three days for rent payments allegedly due
since <DATE>Dec. 1, 1987</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Weiss</PERSON>' company, <ORGANIZATION>One Peach Associates</ORGANIZATION>, asked a marshal to obtain
an eviction notice on <DATE>Sept. 6, 1989</DATE>, according to the papers. A
judge validated the eviction warrant the next week and then Colon
filed to stop the proceedings, saying he had not seen the court
papers.
   Colon maintained in an affidavit that all his rent had been
paid. A judge granted a stay of the eviction warrant.
   Papers filed on <DATE>March 12</DATE> assert that <ORGANIZATION>Colon</ORGANIZATION> ``made substantial
improvements to the premises with the approval and consent of the
petitioner.''
   The case was to have been tried today.
   One Peach also leased space to La Salsa, another after-hours
club around the corner from Happy Land, for <MONEY>$2,500</MONEY> a month, the
<ORGANIZATION>Daily News</ORGANIZATION> said in today's editions.
   Neighborhood residents said La Salsa has one door and no
windows. Because of fire code violations, it had been ordered
closed on <DATE>Aug. 28, 1988</DATE>, the News reported.
   La Salsa was packed with revelers on the night of the fire at
Happy Land.

<HEAD>In Aftermath of Fire, 87 Sad Stories Unfold</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One played soccer. One sewed clothes. One never
saw the infant son he left behind in <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>Happy Land
Social Club</ORGANIZATION> fire was not a single catastrophe but 87 _ one for each
victim.
   The stories unfold, one after another, as families of the
victims arrange funerals here and in <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION>. At a
makeshift clearinghouse at a school near the burned-out club, they
seek help from government and relief organizations even as they
mourn.
   <PERSON>Herman Gamoneda</PERSON> remembered his cousins, 23-year-old <PERSON>Marco
Gamoneda</PERSON> and 18-year-old Leni, as brothers who were also
inseparable friends.
   ``They did everything together. They were always together. They
worked together, they were going to school together. A couple of
nice guys,'' he said.
   Their brother, <PERSON>Jose</PERSON>, showed four photographs of <PERSON>Marco</PERSON> and Leni
in their soccer uniforms _ they played together on the Falcons club
in the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> _ and relaxing at home. In one, <PERSON>Marco</PERSON> clowned with
another teammate.
   They had arrived in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION> two years
ago and both attended at <ORGANIZATION>Bronx Community College</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Herman Gamoneda</PERSON>
said they had never gone out together at night _ until <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   Their bodies will return, together, to <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION> for burial.
   So will the body of <PERSON>Naomi Luque DeGarcia</PERSON>, 43. She had been a
school teacher in <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION> for 21 years and had taken a six-month
leave. She had come to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> two months ago to visit a cousin;
her husband and four children, ranging from age 2{ to 17, were
grieving back in <LOCATION>Puerta Tela</LOCATION>.
   There were so many others.
   Minerva <PERSON>Ramos Duprey</PERSON>, 51, was a bartender at the club who worked
days as a seamstress. ``She was full of life,'' said a niece,
<PERSON>Alicia Bocachica</PERSON>. <PERSON>Nicholas Zapata Guadron</PERSON>, 22, was a construction
worker who dreamed of buying a house and running a little store in
<LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Lester Orlando Cruz</PERSON>, in his early 20s, had come to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> 14
months ago, leaving behind his pregnant wife in <PERSON>Potrerillo Cortes</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>. She subsequently gave birth, but ``he never saw his baby
son. Only in pictures. He wanted to send for his wife and kid,''
said <PERSON>Carmen Rodriguez</PERSON>, a friend.
   Juan <PERSON>Carlos Colon</PERSON> had been in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> since <DATE>1983</DATE>. He was 18, a
senior at a <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> high school, a good soccer player.
   He wanted to be a video producer, and he used the video art to
fight drug abuse. He was ``a good, gentle boy. You'd often hear him
warning young people to stay away from drugs,'' said his
stepmother, <PERSON>Miriam Colon</PERSON>.
   He was at Happy Land that <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> with his girlfriend,
<PERSON>Alba Romero Escoto</PERSON>. She, too, perished; she, too, was an
18-year-old immigrant from <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>, a high-school senior who
worked weekends as a home attendant.
   There was <PERSON>Israel Laurino</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veteran who rarely went out;
<PERSON>Francisco Romero</PERSON>, 33, a janitor who left behind six kids and a
pregnant wife; <PERSON>Elias Colon</PERSON>, owner of the club, a 20-year veteran of
the <ORGANIZATION>Merchant Marine</ORGANIZATION>.
   Each left behind a legion of mourners. <PERSON>Lester McNab</PERSON>, 24, stood
across the street from the social club on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> and stared _ he
lost a dozen friends in the fire, and had planned to be there that
night.
   ``I don't know how it could happen. I can't explain it. It's not
rational. I'm just here standing in shock,'' he said.
   A young woman shouted out that her cousin was among the dead.
``I was here at 12:30 ( the night of the fire). I left here at
12:30. When I woke up, my mother told me she was gone,'' she said.
   Screaming and crying, she collapsed steps away from where her
cousin died.

The bodies of 50 of the 87 people killed in a <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> social club fire were 
loaded onto a cargo plane at <LOCATION>Kennedy Airport</LOCATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> for a late-night 
flight to <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>, a nation in mourning. 
</P>
<P>
At a brief memorial service in the hangar to which the coffins had come, some 
in hearses, others stacked on flatbed trucks, Deputy Mayor <PERSON>Bill Lynch</PERSON> said <LOCATION>New 
York</LOCATION> would "do all possible to make sure this will never happen again." 
</P>
<P>
"These young people came to this great city of ours seeking hope and 
opportunity, and now they leave like this," <PERSON>Lynch</PERSON> said, gesturing toward the 
long row of coffins. "The bodies lying here before us say we've got to do more. 
We've got to do more to make sure this doesn't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
As he spoke, police were continuing their crackdown on the hundreds of 
unlicensed social clubs that dot the city's poorer neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they visited 261 locations late <DATE>Friday</DATE> and early <DATE>Saturday</DATE> and found 
only 65 clubs open. They issued 29 orders to vacate the premises, 57 summonses 
and 80 violation notices. 
</P>
<P>
Most club operators closed down before they were shut down, according to a 
neighborhood store owner who has supplied liquor to social clubs. 
</P>
<P>
The retailer said that by <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> he had not heard from any of the 
clubs that normally contact him to place orders. 
</P>
<P>
Because they are not licensed, social clubs cannot obtain liquor from 
wholesalers and must buy from retailers. 
</P>
<P>
A <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> grand jury has indicted <PERSON>Julio Gonzalez</PERSON> with murder for allegedly 
setting the fire that devastated the Happy Land social club a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
The DC-8 scheduled to take the 50 bodies to <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION> was chartered by the 
<ORGANIZATION>American Red Cross</ORGANIZATION>. A spokesman said about 100 relatives of fire victims were 
being flown to <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> expense on commercial flights.

<TEXT>
   Jailed as an army deserter in <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>, the Mariel
refugee charged with setting the nightclub fire that killed 87
people was described as a street hustler who recently lost his job
and girlfriend.
   <PERSON>Julio Gonzalez</PERSON>, 36, was moved <DATE>Monday</DATE> from the <LOCATION>Rikers Island</LOCATION> jail
to the psychiatric ward at <ORGANIZATION>Kings County Hospital</ORGANIZATION>, where he was
under a suicide watch, said <PERSON>Ruby Ryles</PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the city
<ORGANIZATION>Corrections Department</ORGANIZATION>.
   Gonzalez, charged with murdering 87 people by torching the <ORGANIZATION>Happy
Land Social Club</ORGANIZATION> early <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, had no prior criminal record.
   Gonzalez told immigration officials when he arrived in the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE> that he had portrayed himself as a drug
trafficker to Cuban authorities in order to get kicked out of <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>,
<PERSON>Duke Austin</PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Immigration and Naturalization
Service</ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION>The New York Times</ORGANIZATION>.
   There was no evidence <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> was involved with drugs here,
officials said.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials have complained that many of the 125,000 people
kicked out of <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> in the boatlift had criminal records or mental
disorders. Others were simply dissatisfied with life in <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>.
   Gonzalez reportedly lost his last job, at a lamp factory, about
six months ago. Detective <PERSON>James Malvey</PERSON> said <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> since had
hustled money washing cars and peddling.
   For the past three months <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> has lived in an <MONEY>$80-a-week</MONEY>
furnished room in the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>. Before that he had lived with
45-year-old <PERSON>Lydia Feliciano</PERSON>.
   ``He was just a normal guy,'' said <PERSON>Ray Davis</PERSON>, the building
manager. ``He's a nice, quiet, clean guy.''
   Gonzalez allegedly told police he torched the club after
quarreling with <PERSON>Ms. Feliciano</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Franco Mena</PERSON>, who showed up at the club after the fire, said he
and another man prevailed on <PERSON>Ms. Feliciano</PERSON> to identify <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> as
the arsonist. ``She didn't want to talk because she thought nobody
had heard her argument,'' <PERSON>Mena</PERSON> said.
   Bronx District Attorney <PERSON>Robert Johnson</PERSON> said <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON>'s shoes
still reeked of gasoline when he was arrested at his apartment 12
hours after the fire.
   According to immigration records, <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> arrived in the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> at <LOCATION>Key West</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, on <DATE>May 31, 1980</DATE>, as part of the Mariel
boatlift.
   He was detained at <LOCATION>Camp McCoy</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wis.</LOCATION>, then <LOCATION>Fort Chaffee</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ark.</LOCATION>,
until <DATE>Feb. 21, 1981</DATE>, when he was released, said <PERSON>Verne Jervis</PERSON> of the
immigration service.
   He was sent to live with a sponsor family in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. The
agency that handled that placement said it was still looking for
<PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON>' records.
   Gonzalez told federal officials that he was in a Cuban prison
from <DATE>1971</DATE> to <DATE>1974</DATE> for desertion. But that account had not been
confirmed, officials said.
   Jervis said <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> had never applied for permanent residence,
which makes him deportable after doing time for a criminal offense.

<HEAD>Arson Ruled Out In Social Club Fire</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The death toll in a fire that gutted a basement
social club was revised downward from seven to six, and officials
said the blaze did not appear to be arson as was originally
suspected.
   ``We believe at this point that the fire was accidental, but
many important witnesses who were badly injured have yet to be
interviewed by fire marshals,'' Fire Department spokesman <PERSON>John
Mulligan</PERSON> said <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   Dozens of patrons who were injured in <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s fire at the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>
club known as The Hole remain hospitalized, many severely burned.
Eighteen firefighters also were hurt, none seriously.
   Arson was initially suspected because of the rapid spread of the
blaze at the club, which officials said operated illegally because
it served liquor without a license and didn't have enough exits to
comply with building codes.
   Many social clubs here operate like bottle clubs in other
states, where customers bring their own liquor and get mixers from
the management.
   Fire and police officials were unable <DATE>Monday</DATE> to explain why
seven dead were counted <DATE>Sunday</DATE> instead of the correct six, said
police spokesman <PERSON>Peter O'Donnell</PERSON>.
   Mayor <PERSON>Edward I. Koch</PERSON> said <DATE>Monday</DATE> that he wanted the city to do
more to close illegal social clubs.
   ``What can we do to locate all of these illegal premises and
close them down?'' <PERSON>Koch</PERSON> said in a memo to the police commissioner,
fire commissioner and buildings commissioner.
   The Hole has been raided five times since <DATE>March</DATE> by the <ORGANIZATION>Police
Department</ORGANIZATION>, and there have been nine arrests, said <PERSON>Koch</PERSON> spokesman
<PERSON>Tom Kelly</PERSON>.
   The club did not have a liquor license, <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> said.
   Koch described the club, a 50-by-75-foot T-shaped space, as a
``rabbit warren.''
   The steep, narrow staircase leading down to the club was ``no
better than a ladder,'' said <PERSON>Mulligan</PERSON>.

   The owner of an illegal basement nightclub where
six people died in a fire was arrested at a pay phone after police
traced a call he made to a detective to assert his innocence,
authorities said <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Domingo Reyes</PERSON>, 37, was charged <DATE>Thursday</DATE> with six counts of
manslaughter and 10 of reckless endangerment in the blaze at the
<LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> club known as The Hole, said Deputy Chief <PERSON>Daniel Ryan</PERSON>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Fire Department</ORGANIZATION> said the blaze <DATE>Sunday</DATE> appeared to be
accidental, but <PERSON>Reyes</PERSON> was held responsible because the club was
illegally operated, authorities said.
   The club served liquor without a license and did not have enough
exits, officials said.
   Six patrons were killed and 33 others injured. The reckless
endangerment counts relate to the 10 most seriously injured, <PERSON>Ryan</PERSON>
said.
   Reyes was arrested after he called police, ran out of change and
gave the number to a detective who promised to call back, said
<PERSON>Ryan</PERSON>. The detective kept him on the line for 35 minutes while
police used the number to locate the phone.
   ``Reyes was explaining (to the detective) he didn't think he'd
done anything wrong,'' said <PERSON>Ryan</PERSON>. ``Basically, he was protesting
his innocence.''
   Police are also looking for <PERSON>Reyes</PERSON>' partner in the club, but <PERSON>Ryan</PERSON>
said he is believed to be out of the country.
   Police had raided The Hole five times since <DATE>March</DATE> and made nine
arrests, said mayoral spokesman <PERSON>Tom Kelly</PERSON>. The steep, narrow
staircase leading down to the club was ``no better than a ladder,''
said <ORGANIZATION>Fire Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>John Mulligan</PERSON>.

   Hundreds of mourners, many weeping, others
calling for revenge, offered their prayers at a funeral home
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> for 17 victims of the city's deadliest fire in 79 years.
   Officials, meanwhile, began preparations for a grim airlift of
the dead to their Honduran homeland. The <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> has asked the
<ORGANIZATION>New York National Guard</ORGANIZATION> to help transport the bodies, an aide to
Gov. <PERSON>Mario Cuomo</PERSON> said.
   A funeral Mass <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME> at <ORGANIZATION>St. Joseph's Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION>
drew 1,500 people, while 1,000 others who could not get in stood
outside the church during the service.
   Earlier, outside the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> funeral home across the street from
<LOCATION>St. Joseph</LOCATION>'s, the street was crowded with people waiting to pay
their respects to the victims. The dead were among 87 people killed
early <DATE>Sunday</DATE> inside the Happy Land social club in the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>, just
10 blocks away.
   Three women fainted outside the funeral home, collapsing in
front of the crowd waiting to enter. At least 15 others needed
medical assistance.
   <PERSON>Jose Alvarez</PERSON>, mourning his brother <PERSON>Denny</PERSON>, 22, left the <ORGANIZATION>Rivera
Funeral Home</ORGANIZATION> sobbing and clinging to his cousin and a friend.
   Across the street on the steps of the church, <PERSON>Denny</PERSON>'s father
tearfully vented his rage at <PERSON>Julio Gonzalez</PERSON>, 36, the man accused of
setting the fatal fire in a quarrel with an ex-girlfriend.
   ``They ought to take him and give him a public hanging,'' <PERSON>Pedro
Alvarez</PERSON> said. ``People like that don't deserve to live.''
   Two women emerged from the home screaming the names of dead
relatives. Others expressed disbelief their friends were gone.
   ``He doesn't look like him. He looks too old,'' said <PERSON>Katy
Carval</PERSON>, 17, after seeing former classmate <PERSON>Israel Bulnes</PERSON>, 18, who
died with his girlfriend.
   Earlier in the day, family members of the victims met with
<ORGANIZATION>American Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> officials at a public school near the burned-out
red brick building to receive the belongings each victim carried or
wore when the fire struck.
   Outside the school, <PERSON>Carlos Pena</PERSON> clutched a manila envelope that
held a watch, a set of keys, and some cash _ things his brother
<PERSON>Eli</PERSON>, 26, had with him early <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at the doomed Happy Land club.
   The watch came with <ORGANIZATION>Eli</ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Carlos</PERSON> said the
timepiece would now be his. ``It means a lot, a reminder,'' he said.
   Also <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, a civil court hearing did not determine whether
the club operator's widow should replace her husband, <PERSON>Elias Colon</PERSON>,
in an eviction lawsuit brought by the landlord, <ORGANIZATION>One Peach
Associates</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Jay Weiss</PERSON>, husband of actress <PERSON>Kathleen Turner</PERSON>, is part owner of
One Peach, which held a 49-year lease on the building from one of
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s biggest landlords, <PERSON>Alex DiLorenzo III</PERSON>.
   The court hearing did not address responsibility for the fire or
whether the landlords were aware of a city effort to close the club
because it was illegal and unsafe.
   While wakes were held <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, funeral arrangements still were
being made.
   The Honduran government said it expected the bodies of 75 fire
victims to begin arriving late this week at <LOCATION>San Pedro Sula</LOCATION> in
northwestern <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>.
   More than one-third of the Hondurans were from <LOCATION>Puerto Cortes</LOCATION>, a
<LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> port 135 miles northwest of <LOCATION>Tegucigalpa</LOCATION>, said Information
Minister <PERSON>Nahum Valladares</PERSON>.
   The Honduran government declared three days of national mourning
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, and said 78 victims had been identified as Honduran.
   The government was negotiating with <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION> to take the
bodies from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, where they would be transferred to
the Honduran airline Tan-Sahsa, said the minister.
   The airline was working with the <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> to provide special
fares for relatives wishing to attend the funerals in <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>,
said spokeswoman <PERSON>Karen Ceremsak</PERSON>. Tan-Sahsa and the <LOCATION>Costa Rican</LOCATION>
carrier <ORGANIZATION>Lacsa</ORGANIZATION> also offered to help, said <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Larry
Mackler</PERSON>.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, Rep. <PERSON>Patricia Schroeder</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Colo.</LOCATION>, called on the
<ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> to donate use of a transport plane to return fire victims
for burial in their homelands of <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Dominican
Republic</LOCATION>.
   ``Providing an <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> plane would be a humanitarian gesture
to the families of the victims,'' she said in a letter to <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION>
Secretary <PERSON>Donald Rice</PERSON>. ``Moreover, it would help express <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s
sorrow for the tragedy and our affection for our neighbors in the
hemisphere.''
   An <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> spokesman, Lt. Col. <PERSON>Darrell Hayes</PERSON>, said <PERSON>Rice</PERSON> has
the matter ``under consideration.''
