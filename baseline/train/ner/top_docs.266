<TEXT>
   For months beneath the streets of this college town, artist <PERSON>Paul Matisse</PERSON> and his audience have been communing about music, joy and mechanical engineering. 

   It began in <DATE>October</DATE> after he installed 16 massive chimes in <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>'s recently renovated <LOCATION>Kendall Square</LOCATION> subway station. 
The piece, called "Pythagoras," was broken the day after its unveiling, and despite repairs and redesignings, it has been broken repeatedly since then. 
It isn't vandalism. 
<PERSON>Mr. Matisse</PERSON> just hadn't taken into account the urgency of the yearning to make euphony behind all those tired, poker faces on the subway. 

   Working on commission from the <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Cambridge Arts Council</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Matisse</PERSON> specifically designed the piece so strap-hangers could make it ring. 
And ring it does, when you pull on one of two handles, which are really aluminum arms projecting from the walls of the inbound and outbound platforms and linked via overhead rods and levers to the chimes, which hang out of reach between the tracks. 
The chimes themselves are aluminum cylinders, four inches in diameter and as much as almost nine feet long. 
When rung, they make soul-satisfying tintinnabulations, like big gongs in a cave. 

   The handles are the weak links in this troglodyte's delight. 
Gently rocking them swings the hammers, which sway back and forth like the tongues of bells to strike the chimes. 
The handles look strong, but some commuters get carried away and throw themselves onto them like Rocky training for his last-chance match. 
The resulting breakdowns at first chagrined <PERSON>Mr. Matisse</PERSON>, who is the grandson of the painter <PERSON>Henri Matisse</PERSON> and the stepson of artist <PERSON>Marcel Duchamp</PERSON>. 
This <PERSON>Mr. Matisse</PERSON> got his training at <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> in design, he has dabbled in physics, engineering and architecture, and he takes pride in getting the details right. 
His specialty is precisely machined mobiles -- things of steel wheels and interlockings sweet enough to charm the socks off a mechanical engineer. 

   When he heard his chimes had broken, <PERSON>Mr. Matisse</PERSON> headed for the station to set things right. 
Arriving from his home, which once was and still looks like a big, white Baptist church in <LOCATION>Groton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, about an hour's drive away, the 55-year-old artist witnessed a subway rider "really putting his back into it and just working away with tremendous force" on the remaining unbroken handle. 
"There are people," he reflects like a traveler just back from a strange land, "who live in that world in which action is put over all the other stuff." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Matisse</PERSON>'s dialogue with his audience began when he posted gently admonishing, apologetic notes next to the disabled handles. 
A typical one said: "This time it was an epoxied joint that gave in to someone's enthusiasm . . . 
Thanks for waiting." 

   The <LOCATION>Kendall Square</LOCATION> station is the stop for <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION> and it is two stops from <LOCATION>Harvard</LOCATION>, which partly explains why many passers-by reacted to the notes like professors grading a pet student's paper. 
Instead of defacing <PERSON>Mr. Matisse</PERSON>'s 8 1/2-by-11 sheets, they penned criticisms, praise, advice and all manner of marginalia on them. 

   As the chimes' ups and downs continued, <PERSON>Mr. Matisse</PERSON>'s notes became a kind of spontaneous art forum. 
It continues, for though "Pythagoras" is working again, he still posts messages about progress on two other musical contraptions he is making for the station. 
He has collected an impressive sheaf of the annotated notes next to the personal computer he used to design the chimes' acoustics, which are based on the same blend of mathematics and music that fascinated Pythagoras, the ancient Greek inventor of a musical scale and the geometry theorem that bears his name. 

   The "Pythagoras" graffiti tell, sometimes eloquently, of an outburst of delight and surprise in a place of monotonous routine. 
"Heaven couldn't have better bells than this," wrote one passing critic. 
"Thanks for making me forget the horrors of this day," inscribed a harried soul. 
Another enchanted commuter confessed that he "felt like the Hunchback of <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION>" when ringing the chimes. 

   Many comments sound like excerpts from a standing ovation for an opera performed at the <ORGANIZATION>Tower of Babel</ORGANIZATION>. 
"Wunderbar," roared one passerby with his pen. 
"Magnifico," shouted another. 
At least one excited scribbling seems to be in <LOCATION>Sanskrit</LOCATION>. 

   A few of these underground music critics strive toward poetry, with such lyrical reactions as, "a tender use of metal" or the chimes "transform a subway pit to a subterranean cathedral." 

   The majority, however, seem to have come right out of the heart of <LOCATION>MIT</LOCATION>, whose plain buildings are identified by numbers rather than names. 
<PERSON>Mr. Matisse</PERSON>'s technical difficulties have fired the imaginations of the scientists and engineers passing through the station. 
"A viscous clutch might do the job," wrote one laconic observer. 
Another sketched a picture of a proposed solution, in which opposing pistons absorb excessive forces. 
One <ORGANIZATION>MIT</ORGANIZATION> insider offered the services of the school's mechanical engineers, who "would love to take this on as a project." 
The most succinct suggestion came from a self-described physicist, who simply jotted down an equation for the desired motion of the hammers. 

   Small debates soon broke out among the technical kibitzers. 
"The problem is with the length of the hammers; the rhythm needed to ring the long and short {ones} does not correspond," wrote one of them. 
But "that's what creates interesting rhythmic variations," countered a second. 
Try to "hit the natural frequency," advised a third. 

   When one petulant perfectionist advised <PERSON>Mr. Matisse</PERSON> to take an introductory <ORGANIZATION>MIT</ORGANIZATION> class in mechanical design "coz it's obvious you don't know the first thing about it," someone else scribbled underneath, "<PERSON>Paul</PERSON>, Pay No Mind!! 
This guy is an ass." 

   Perhaps the ultimate testament to the chimes' success as mass-transit art are the comments from those who don't seem to be part of the academic crowd. 
"Groovy tunes, dude," inscribed one reviewer; "Like, dude, way kickin'," wrote another. 
In large, eloquent block letters, one of <PERSON>Mr. Matisse</PERSON>'s favorite appreciators opined: "Radical move, dude." 

   Comments <PERSON>Mr. Matisse</PERSON>, "I'm very pleased that my work seems to be universally affecting. 
It isn't art in the usual sense. 
Art in the usual sense is a mystery at the moment. 
I love the immediately evident, rather than the more abstract, abstruse focusings." 

   For their part, the <PERSON>Kendall</PERSON> band, as <PERSON>Mr. Matisse</PERSON> calls those who ring his chimes, continue to dream up responses to his work that are more gratifying to him than normal art criticism. 
Recently, he experienced a kind of epiphany when finishing up some work in the station a little after <TIME>5 a.m.</TIME> (<PERSON>Mr. 
Matisse</PERSON> can work on his subway art pieces only in the <TIME>early morning</TIME>, when the trains aren't running.) 

   As he recalls it: "On the other side of the tracks, there were two ladies, who I think were coming home from all-night cleaning jobs. 
They sat down, and one of them looked over at me and gestured for me to play the chimes. 
They just wanted to hear them. 
So I played."

   Beauty in Numbers: Pythagoras Revisited

   In ancient times, the mathematical mystic Pythagoras
proclaimed that the world was made of numbers. While this
seems slightly mad to us today, I have heard of people in
Paris and New Haven, Conn., who subscribe to the equally
barmy belief that the world is made of words or "texts." In
any case, the Pythagoreans were the first to discover the
numerical basis of harmony in music, and hence the link
between mathematics and beauty. They also thought, historians
tell us, that it was sinful to eat beans.
   I do not know whether John Allen Paulos abstains from
beans, but, as a self-avowed "numbers man," he does seem to
be a bit of a neo-Pythagorean. Two years ago Mr. Paulos wrote
a surprise best seller called "Innumeracy" that was both a
lament for the inability of Americans to think about the
world mathematically and an entertaining attempt to do
something about it. Now this Temple University professor has
produced a follow-up volume, "Beyond Numeracy: Ruminations of
a Numbers Man" (Knopf, 285 pages, $22), for those who would
like to be initiated into the higher mysteries.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It is in essence a tour through 70 topics in mathematics:
some elementary (algebra, matrices), some advanced (topology,
platonic solids), some avant-garde (chaos theory) and some
philosophical (the fractal nature of consciousness,
mathematics in ethics, math and humor).
   His brief essays are arranged alphabetically by topic, and
as with one of its precursors, <ORGANIZATION>Voltaire</ORGANIZATION>'s "Philosophical
Dictionary," it makes for an often-jolly little book. Also a
reassuring one: In his discussion of probability, <PERSON>Mr. Paulos</PERSON>
notes that if you add up the chances of being murdered by all
the terrorists, muggers, serial killers, drunk drivers and
other homicidal types in the world, the probability is
greater that you will kill yourself.
   The main point of any book such as this should be to
convince mathematical philistines of the keen pitch of
aesthetic pleasure the subject affords. Beauty, indeed, is
the paramount criterion of good mathematics; as the great
English number theorist <PERSON>G.H. Hardy</PERSON> once remarked, "There is
no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics." This,
of course, will come as a surprise to the vast majority of
educated people who never got beyond calculus, for "school
mathematics" is extremely dull and is usually taught in the
most unimaginative possible way.
   <PERSON>Mr. Paulos</PERSON> does reasonably well in conveying the aesthetic
appeal of mathematics. He presents <ORGANIZATION>Euclid</ORGANIZATION>'s proof that there
are infinitely many prime numbers, which exemplifies the
elements of economy, surprise and inevitability that go to
make up mathematical elegance. He also gives a nice, simple
account of the different orders of infinity, an awesome idea
that everyone really ought to know about -- although perhaps
not too much, considering that the man who discovered them in
the <DATE>late 19th century</DATE>, <PERSON>Georg Cantor</PERSON>, came to a rather sticky
and demented end.
   Several essays draw connections between mathematics and
the arts. The author explains the "golden section," a ratio
heavily exploited by the designers of the <LOCATION>Parthenon</LOCATION> and at
one time believed to be the universal key to beauty in nature
and art. He delves into the mathematical basis of music. And
he provides a much-needed -- for Americans, at least --
introduction to a French society of mathematically inclined
litterateurs called OULIPO (the French acronym for Workshop
of Potential Literature). Typical of their output is <PERSON>Raymond
Queneau</PERSON>'s "Cent mille milliards poemes." Achieved by a
combinatoric sleight of hand, this sequence of one hundred
trillion sonnets -- which <PERSON>Mr. Paulos</PERSON>, in what one hopes is a
rare lapse for a numbers man, miscalculates as a mere 10
trillion -- dwarfs the rest of the world's poetic output.
   Where <PERSON>Mr. Paulos</PERSON> goes wrong, I feel, is in seeing
mathematics as a font of practical wisdom. It is true that
those who have some grounding in probability and statistics
are less likely than innumerates to be gulled by astrologers,
bureaucrats and other charlatans. But this is lowbrow
mathematics. Real mathematics has almost nothing to do with
the world of affairs. The theory of numbers, for example, is
perhaps the most daunting yet aesthetically gratifying area
of mathematics; it is also supremely useless -- "l'art pour
l'art."
   Moreover, those who spend too much time communing with
abstract mathematical entities tend to behave in an arrogant,
foolish, even mischievous manner when it comes to practical
matters. A case in point is one of <PERSON>Mr. Paulos</PERSON>'s heroes,
<PERSON>Bertrand Russell</PERSON>. Of this sometimes pacifist, sometimes
atomic saber-rattler, full-time scourge of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> foreign
policy, the historian <ORGANIZATION>G.M. Trevelyan</ORGANIZATION> aptly remarked: "He may
be a genius at mathematics -- as to that I am no judge; but
he is a perfect goose at politics."
   If there is much to take issue with in "Beyond Numeracy,"
there is also much to be amused and enlightened by. The lore
has it that when Pythagoras discovered his great theorem on
right triangles, he was so transported that he sacrificed 100
head of oxen to the gods as a token of gratitude. On this
scale, <PERSON>Mr. Paulos</PERSON>'s book is surely worth an ox or two.

<TEXT>
   There's a <ORGANIZATION>Matisse</ORGANIZATION> hanging in a <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>
subway station that has nothing to with fauvism, impressionism or
any of the other labels commonly associated with the name.
   Most Matisses appeal to the eye. The subway Matisse _ 16 massive
aluminum chimes and teak-tipped hammers suspended between the
tracks at the <LOCATION>Kendall Square</LOCATION> stop _ pleases the ear with a majestic
sound that comes when a handle from the platform is pulled.
   <PERSON>Henri Matisse</PERSON> is considered one of the most influential
20th-century artists. His boldy colored canvases that typify the
fauvist movement hang in famous galleries worldwide. Fauvism was a
French expressionist movement that involved such artists as
<ORGANIZATION>Matisse</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Vlaminck</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Derain</PERSON> and utilized strong, bold colors and
distorted forms.
   His grandson, <PERSON>Paul Matisse</PERSON>, is less famous. He doesn't paint,
but since setting up the chimes of ``Pythagoras'' last <DATE>October</DATE>, he
is cherished by hundreds of commuters who have left their scribbled
comments on a pad near the handle.
   ``I am getting a Proustian rush: Is this normal?'' reads one. A
less profound comment says simply: ``Radical move, Dude.''
   Others have viewed his functional mobiles at <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s Museum
of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the <ORGANIZATION>National
Gallery of Art</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>; the <LOCATION>Musee</LOCATION> d`Art Moderne in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>; the
<LOCATION>Bienalle</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION>; and at other <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and foreign galleries.
   Matisse, whose father, <PERSON>Pierre</PERSON>, is a well-known art dealer in <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION>, lives and works in a former Baptist church in <LOCATION>Groton</LOCATION> _ a
sleepy town about 50 miles northwest of <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> _ with his wife,
artist <PERSON>Linda Hoffman</PERSON>, and their two children.
   He talked about himself and his grandfather during a recent
interview in his workshop _ a clutter of drill presses, lathes,
jigsaws and other tools he wields to create works that titillate
the imagination through movement, sight and sound.
   As a boy visiting <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> for <DATE>summer</DATE> holidays, <PERSON>Matisse</PERSON> sat
frequently for his grandfather and has recollections of him as ``a
terrifying presence.''
   ``When he looked at you to draw you, you were looked at,'' he
said. ``He was like a 50,000-watt search light.''
   Matisse bears some physical resemblance to his grandfather. He
now does not seem to suffer from the burden of living up to such a
famous heritage.
   It was not always so.
   ``What happens is in a lifetime you go through a whole series of
responses,'' he said with a chuckle. ``So you go through a negative
response. I've gone beyond that, and I feel a very positive
appreciation of the fact that he was back there.''
   But he is at pains to emphasize the obvious _ there is no
similarity between his works and that of his grandfather, who died
in <DATE>1954</DATE>.
   ``When he drew a line, he drew a line he wanted to draw,'' he
said. ``He knew exactly what he wanted to do, and I remember him
telling me that his hand was his servant, and I don't work that way
at all.
   ``I have to draw (while drafting), so I do. But it's not so much
that, it's just that I don't have a great love of color and form,''
the 55-year-old artist said. ``I have a great love of ideas, which
is different entirely, and I think I'm much closer to <PERSON>Duchamp</PERSON> in
respect.''
   Matisse's kinship with <PERSON>Marcel Duchamp</PERSON>, the famed French artist
who began challenging traditional art concepts during the <DATE>early
years of this century</DATE>, goes beyond a love for the unusual. Duchamp,
who died in <DATE>1968</DATE>, was <ORGANIZATION>Matisse</ORGANIZATION>'s stepfather.
   Matisse, an acknowledged authority on <PERSON>Duchamp</PERSON>, referred several
times to one of his stepfather's most controversial works _ a
common urinal entitled ``Fountain,'' which shocked the art world of
his time. He hinted at a common bond in describing DuChamp as an
ideas man.
   ``I said <PERSON>Duchamp</PERSON> because <PERSON>Marcel</PERSON> rebelled against `painterly
art,''' he said, commenting on artistic influences. ``He wanted art
with intelligence.
   ``<PERSON>Duchamp</PERSON> said things like `bete comme un peintre' (stupid like
a painter). ``The influence I treasure from him is his point of
view.''
   While mentioning that <PERSON>Duchamp</PERSON> frequently expressed support of
his creations, <PERSON>Matisse</PERSON> emphasized that he is very much an
individual, personally and artistically.
   ``I am delighted that I was as close to him as I was,'' he said.
``But his character was very much his character and in no way does
mine reflect his.
   Although expressing reluctance to characterize his own art,
<ORGANIZATION>Matisse</ORGANIZATION> alluded to his creative philosophy in comments on
``Pythagoras.''
   ``The important part is to do whatever your spirit wants, and
... when you hang up a bell or tube, you do not get beautiful
sound,'' he said.
   ``I was able to do all that, so why should I be jealous of my
grandfather's ability to draw lines?''

<TEXT>
THE MUSIC OF THE SPHERES: MUSIC SCIENCE AND THE NATURAL ORDER OF THE
UNIVERSEby <PERSON>Jamie James Little Brown</PERSON> Pounds 18.99, 260 pages
The power of music over mankind, for dancing, fighting, love-making, praying
or mourning, is one of life's unsolved mysteries. Even cows are said to find
it soothing, while <PERSON>Brahms</PERSON>'s spider was literally moved - charmed down its
thread by the composer's harmonies and sent scuttling up again by his
dissonances.
Various solutions to the riddle have been attempted. <PERSON>Deryck Cooke</PERSON> tried 35
years ago in The Language of Music to establish a musical grammar of human
emotions. More recently the psychiatrist <PERSON>Anthony Storr</PERSON> tackled it from the
psycho-biological end in his discursive Music and the Mind.
To describe the abstractions of music in words is notoriously difficult: so
it is not surprising that most music-lovers, and critics, are content to
leave it at that. But it is also a commonplace that science and music have
some affinity (think of all those boffins who play in string quartets), so
that when little Emily passes her Grade 5 piano with distinction the
neighbours exclaim: 'Oh, she must be good at maths]'
Therefore it is somewhat disappointing not to find in this present excursion
into the metaphysics of music any account of current scientific thinking
about why human beings react as they do when they hear certain tones or
rhythms or cadences. Nor are we left much the wiser about that extraordinary
combination of intellectual and emotional satisfaction which the playing and
hearing of 'good' music brings.
The author, an American magazine writer on both science and music, does,
however, trace the history of these phenomena right back to <LOCATION>Pythagoras</LOCATION> -
credited with discovering the mathematics of musical intervals - and his
cult of mystic number-crunchers. Through Plato, the early Christians, and
the Renaissance the cosmic character of music, the link between the universe
and the soul, went unchallenged. It was <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s father who broke the
Pythagorean spell when he discovered that the old Greek's ratios were not
perfect, and a vicious controversy ensued: some even said it against the
natural order to tune keyboards so that music could modulate.
Newton (an alchemist in his spare time) and <PERSON>Kepler</PERSON> (a keen astrologer) were
in thrall to the concept of the music of the spheres; while <PERSON>Leibniz</PERSON>, a
contemporary of JS <PERSON>Bach</PERSON>, said music was 'the hidden arithmetical exercise of
a soul unconscious that it is calculating.' This cosmic conception was only
dispersed by the anthropocentric Romantic movement, a period the author is
reluctant to define too sharply but appears, on balance, to regret.
The feverish cult of the virtuoso and genius gave way in turn to the atonal
<PERSON>Schoenberg</PERSON>, writing at the same time that <PERSON>Einstein</PERSON> was rewriting <PERSON>Newton</PERSON>'s
physics. Even so <PERSON>Schoenberg</PERSON> (developer of the 12-tone system) could seem the
most mystical musician since Pythagoras. He was superstitious about the
number 13 (naturally) and displayed, says the author, a similar 'veneration
of the numinous power of number.'
James completes his tour with an essay on what he sees as the fragmented,
selfish sterility of the contemporary scene. Even here, he finds in
<PERSON>Stockhausen</PERSON>'s account of the sympathetic and healing vibrations of music a
harking back to the time of <ORGANIZATION>Boethius</ORGANIZATION>.
This is a learned, sophisticated book, full of surprises. But it is not at
all clear what conclusion the author wants us to draw from his exegesis: he
is by no means anti-science, yetseems to be saying that music composed in
the cheerless, random world depicted for us by modern hypotheses is bound to
leave us cold and unsatisfied.
If so, he should talk to <PERSON>John Tavener</PERSON>.

   Much of the curriculum of the Afrocentric movement is
based on teaching guides called the African-American Baseline
Essays, published by the Portland, Ore., public schools. The
essays -- on art, language arts, mathematics, music, social
studies and science -- contend that much of their content has
been deliberately omitted by standard "Eurocentric" texts.
Yet many more-traditional scholars say the essays themselves
contain numerous inaccuracies and distortions. What follows
are some excerpts from the essays.

   "<LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> ca. 3100 B.C. was a Black nation. The first 1,100
years of <LOCATION>Dynastic Egypt</LOCATION> during the first six Dynasties was a

   "Since <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> was the birthplace of the human race, it
follows that <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> was the birthplace of mathematics and

   ". . . Specific examples indicate that ancient Egyptians

formation of the so-called Pythagorean theorem. There is hard
evidence that the theorem was known 1,000 years before
Pythagoras."
   "Euclid . . . lived and died in <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>. There is no
suggestion that he ever left <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. Yet he is pictured in
textbooks as a fair European Greek, not as an Egyptian. We

punishment did not consist of slavery. The Hebrews, like the

religiously and intellectually from their sojourn in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>."
   "Cleopatra . . . was of mixed African and Greek parentage.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Observer: High class
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In essence, Observer has only one thing to say to readers who tackled last
<DATE>Monday</DATE>'s numeracy-style questions. It is: 'Go to the top of the class]'
After all, any candidate who got 82.8 per cent of the total marks available
in a test would be considered to have done very well. But that was merely
the average score of the 151 of you who entered the quiz.
The questions, with the answers in italics, were:
1 What is the conventional name for the result of dividing the circumference
of a circle by its diameter? Pi.
2 What is <MONEY>12 1/2 per cent</MONEY> of 60 per cent? 7 1/2 per cent.
3 If 93 folk enter a knock-out singles tournament at tennis, how many
matches are needed before one player emerges as overall winner? 92.
4 In the A1, A2, A3 . . . series of paper-sizes, what mathematical
relationship does the length of each sheet's longer side bear to the length
of its shorter side? When the shorter side is designated as 1, the longer is
the square root of 2.
5 Name the ancient philosopher specifically associated with the theorem that
sheds light on question 4. Pythagoras.
6 What - apart from the fact that no other number is the same as it - is
unique about the number 1,729? It is the smallest number that can be formed
from the sum of two cubes in two different ways (13x123=1,729;
103x93=1,729).
7 Name the unusual mathematician who saw the answer to 6 instantly.
Ramanujan.
As Observer reported <DATE>last Thursday</DATE>, 62 of you produced perfect answers
within the time limit, so necessitating a tie-breaker to find the winner of
the bottle of malt whisky.
As threatened, it is a stinker calling for knowledge both of numerate and of
literary culture. It has two parts.
The focus is the ancient problem: Which number when added to one seventh of
itself equals 19? It is easily solved by algebra which allows a
non-numerical 'place-holder', such as x, to stand for the initially unknown
number constituting the answer - for example, x + x/7 = 19.
But algebra is a relatively recent method which was scarcely known in
<LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, at least, until the mid-16th century. Before then, there was no
facility for using unknown place-holders, and such problems had to be solved
by calculating solely with whole numbers and fractions (as distinct from
decimals), the preferred method being called 'The way of falsehood.' Now to
the question:
A Show how the problem could be worked out by such a pre-algebraic method.
B Which 16th-17th century English poet hinted that he understood the then
new algebra, and in which poem?
All entries welcome, but only the previous 62 timely and all-correct
entrants will be in line for the prize. Answers by fax to Observer on
071-873 3926 or 071-873 3196 by 6pm <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> time tomorrow, or by mail
postmarked the same day.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Such woolly ideas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL SPIVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once it was fur coats. Now, since fashion gurus have obscured the difference
between real and ersatz hides, it is woolly jumpers. Shops one thought of as
staid - the Scottish knitwear specialists, with their changeless tartan ties
and avuncular cardigans - have become targets of the Animal Rights Militia.
This is the organisation which gutted the <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION> store of <ORGANIZATION>Edinburgh
Woollen Mills</ORGANIZATION> earlier in the month. The local animal rights spokesman
allocated precise credit for the action to a guerrilla sub-group of his
movement, known as the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION>. And justice, he said, had been
done on the grounds that 'sheep-shearing leaves sheep susceptible and cold
as a naked human.'
This was not an isolated incident. The <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION> branch of Boots the
<ORGANIZATION>Chemists</ORGANIZATION> was set alight, and certain research units around <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> have
received a new sort of home-made bomb: an exploding mousetrap primed with
razor blades. This aims not only to remove the digits of those scientists
suspected of animal abuse, but also makes a statement on behalf of mice, so
often the choice for laboratory tests.
A flurry, then, of animal rights activity. There is nothing new in this. But
the extension of anathema-status to pullovers is new, and it is always
interesting to watch how the British deal with such issues, for the British
make it part of their self-definition that they are kind to animals when
others in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, especially southern <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, are not.
This nationalistic pride was trumpeted during European negotiations about
rules for transporting livestock. Even those of us who like a good steak, it
seems, are concerned that the ox shall travel to his slaughter in decent
comfort.
Gourmets will point out that a well-rested beast tastes better, so this is
not pure charity; still, it is true that the British get angry about the
ill-treatment of animals, and in that sense the animal rights movement is
never entirely marginal.
Whether many wool-wearing people or even woolly liberals will ever feel pity
for chilly sheep is doubtful. But translating kindness towards animals into
justice for animals is something that we ought to take more seriously than
we do, and scientists, with distinguished exceptions, such as <PERSON>James Gaia
Lovelock</PERSON>, are too quiet about it.
Those activists who resort to pyromania are probably not the sort to engage
in rational argument. Yet it is a debate which used to be very much alive in
pagan philosophy. Pythagoras, who first articulated vegetarianism in the
sixth century BC, was only one of many thinkers who addressed animal rights.
But Christian theologians from <ORGANIZATION>St Augustine</ORGANIZATION> onwards have quelled the issue,
being content to accept the animal kingdom as a part of creation subordinate
to human needs. According to <ORGANIZATION>St Augustine</ORGANIZATION>, if we took the commandment 'Thou
shalt not kill' as an injunction not to slaughter animals, we should also
have to prohibit ourselves from uprooting parsnips.
This is what logicians call a slide. To say that one move will lead to
another is a familiar method for blocking moral progress. Faced with a man
who believes that sheep should not be shorn, we might then insist that he
abstain from the consumption of honey, milk and eggs - all of which have
been regarded as theft by some legally-minded purists - and, like <ORGANIZATION>St
Augustine</ORGANIZATION>, challenge him to wrench a happy parsnip from the earth.
The application of human justice to the animal world hinges, as <PERSON>Richard
Sorabji</PERSON> demonstrated recently in Animal Minds and Human Morals (<ORGANIZATION>Duckworth</ORGANIZATION>),
on how far we consider animals to share in the human capacity for reason.
<PERSON>Charles Darwin</PERSON> believed that there was no human trait which could not be
found reflected in one animal or another; but modern scientists, following
Aristotle, have been forced to use an exclusion zone based on a
technicality. The technicality is that animals have no syntax. It follows
that if a creature cannot construct a sentence, then we are at liberty to do
with it what we will in the slaughterhouse or the research institute.
Consideration of babies, parrots and chimpanzees will immediately generate
worries about the absolute logic of this technicality. Indeed, it is hard to
see what relevance it has in a debate which is primarily about pain and the
capacity of living things to feel it.
Pythagoras stopped a man beating a dog because he recognised in the dog's
yelps the voice of an old friend. Most of us, if we think about it, will
admit unease about testing chemicals on beagles. That does not mean,
necessarily, that we would not wish chemicals to be tried on rats, nor that
we should charitably prefer to wear nylon rather than wool.
What matters is that we give the matter some thought. In that sense, one has
to feel grateful for the occasional arson attack. Crass as they are, such
actions are not unfounded. They rightly make us think.

FT  11 DEC 92 / BJP sees Ayodhya as desperate rallying call: The aspirations
of India's Hindu militant opposition party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<PERSON>MR Kewal Ratan Malkani</PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION>Bharatiya Janata</ORGANIZATION> party, the
radical Hindu party whose militant supporters stormed the <LOCATION>Ayodhya</LOCATION> mosque at
the <DATE>weekend</DATE>, scorns the view that the incident will backfire against the
<ORGANIZATION>BJP</ORGANIZATION>.
'It is only the upper classes who are shocked by this. The masses are
delighted,' he said an interview yesterday. 'Look at <LOCATION>Maharashtra</LOCATION> (the state
which includes <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION> and has born the brunt of the post-Ayodhya violence).
If we had an election there tomorrow we would win.'
The Delhi intelligentsia believes that <PERSON>Mr Malkani</PERSON> is quite wrong. Newspaper
commentators insist that most Indians will now reject the <ORGANIZATION>BJP</ORGANIZATION> on the grounds
that it foments intolerance. But the <ORGANIZATION>BJP</ORGANIZATION> has long learnt to do without the
support of commentators.
<PERSON>Mr Malkani</PERSON>'s boasts reflect the party's defiant mood. The crisis has
suddenly focused its energies. All the arguments over strategy and tactics
which have dogged it over the past year as it saw its popularity waning have
been set aside. So clear is the aim of advancing Hindu militancy that even
the arrest of top <ORGANIZATION>BJP</ORGANIZATION> officials, including <PERSON>Mr L K Advani</PERSON>, the leader, for
alleged incitement of religious hatred, has barely curtailed the party's
activities.
Today the <ORGANIZATION>BJP</ORGANIZATION> plans to stage demonstrations at the Pakistani and <ORGANIZATION>Bangladeshi
High Commissions</ORGANIZATION> to protest against the destruction of Hindu temples in
those countries.
<PERSON>Mr Malkani</PERSON> was outraged by the suggestion that Moslems were merely reacting
to the <LOCATION>Ayodhya</LOCATION> assault. 'They started this. Nobody is as patient as a Hindu
but there are limits to our patience.'
<PERSON>Mr Malkani</PERSON> said he regretted that the assault on the mosque was against the
law. He also regretted the violence which has since swept <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>. But he
accepted none of the responsibility. Instead, he blamed the government of <PERSON>Mr
P V Narasimha Rao</PERSON>, the prime minister, and on the courts for repeatedly
delaying settlement of long-standing Hindu claims to the mosque site.
He also blamed Moslems for allegedly promoting intolerance. 'They smashed
3,000 temples (in the conquest of northern <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>). We want just three back.'
The three are at <LOCATION>Ayodhya</LOCATION>, and at <LOCATION>Mathura</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Varanasi</LOCATION> - two other Hindu holy
cities where mosques stand on disputed sites.
<PERSON>Mr Malkani</PERSON>, who is 71 and has spent his life working for militant <LOCATION>Hinduism</LOCATION>,
speaks like a man who knows that if the <ORGANIZATION>BJP</ORGANIZATION> cannot fire Hindu passions now,
with the <LOCATION>Ayodhya</LOCATION> issue burning, perhaps it never will.
The <ORGANIZATION>BJP</ORGANIZATION> was formed in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE> out of politicians linked to the
<ORGANIZATION>Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh</ORGANIZATION>, the well-disciplined Hindu militant group which
was one of three Hindu organisations banned <TIME>last night</TIME>. It sought to offer
an alternative to the dominant <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> (I) party. But it won just two lower
house parliamentary seats in the <DATE>1984</DATE> general elections.
However, in <DATE>1986</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr Advani</PERSON> began to fan the flames of the <LOCATION>Ayodhya</LOCATION>
controversy. He also exploited growing disillusion with the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> party's
secularism which had united Indians during the struggle to build
post-independent <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> but now seemed sterile.
He won particular support from upper-caste Hindus, some of whom felt they
were losing status as economic modernisation opened more opportunities to
the low-caste masses. The party's financial strength came from many small
shopkeepers and tradesmen, who felt <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> pampered the big corporations
at their expense.
The <ORGANIZATION>BJP</ORGANIZATION> tried to make its ideology coherent. <PERSON>Mr Advani</PERSON> said it was a 'nation
first' party. Ideologues explained <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> should reject secularism and become
an overtly Hindu nation. Historians rewrote parts of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s past to
emphasise, for example, the role of Hindu princes, instead of Moslems, in
opposing British rule. Even maths was not spared  - the Pythagoras theorem
was attributed in one BJP-sponsored textbook to <LOCATION>Baudhayan</LOCATION>, an Indian
mathematician who allegedly discovered it 450 years before <PERSON>Pythagoras</PERSON>.
In last year's general election, the <ORGANIZATION>BJP</ORGANIZATION> secured 119 seats out of 543,
making it the second largest party after <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. It also won control of
the state government in four states - the first taste of real power.
However, the <ORGANIZATION>BJP</ORGANIZATION> then lost ground. It was unlucky in being unable seriously
to challenge <PERSON>Mr Rao</PERSON>'s economic reforms - a key issue over the past 18
months. <ORGANIZATION>BJP</ORGANIZATION> leaders were early fans of economic deregulation but the prime
minister stole their clothes. The party's clean image was sullied by
divisions between leaders and a minor sex scandal. In governing states, it
suffered from inexperience.
Moreover, even as they were wooed by the cause of Hindu unity, Hindus could
hardly forget their many differences - including caste, language, wealth and
regional origin. Without <LOCATION>Ayodhya</LOCATION>, it was difficult for the <ORGANIZATION>BJP</ORGANIZATION> to offer
enough to hold them together. This <DATE>autumn</DATE>, when the <LOCATION>Ayodhya</LOCATION> conflict had
temporarily gone quiet, an opinion survey showed just 14 per cent of those
polled wanted <PERSON>Mr Advani</PERSON> as prime minister, against 49 per cent for <PERSON>Mr Rao</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mr Pran Chopra</PERSON>, a leading political analyst, is convinced <PERSON>Mr Advani</PERSON>'s rating
has fallen further this week: '<ORGANIZATION>Ayodhya</ORGANIZATION> will damage the <ORGANIZATION>BJP</ORGANIZATION>'s share of the
total vote. The feelings of committed supporters may have hardened, but the
party will lose mass support.' <PERSON>Mr Chopra</PERSON> believes the voice of moderation
will prevail - a view shared by other analysts.

Quips and Quintessences

<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   In all the current excitement about education that has made best sellers out of <ORGANIZATION>E.D. Hirsch Jr.</ORGANIZATION>'s "Cultural Literacy" and <PERSON>Allan Bloom</PERSON>'s "The Closing of the American Mind," there is one central issue. 
It is the failure of the schools to lure students into the slipstream of intellectual history. 
<PERSON>Mr. Hirsch</PERSON> wants to correct this on the cheap, by teaching a short list of terms that will allow his acolytes to pass themselves off as intellectuals. 
<PERSON>Mr. Bloom</PERSON> has a higher aim, a return to high educational standards through hard mental work. 

   In their separate ways, both of these authors have been making a hero of the intellectual. 
<PERSON>Mr. Hirsch</PERSON>'s list is a kind of magic elixir, a Superman suit that will transform Video Dolt into Highbrow. 
<PERSON>Mr. Bloom</PERSON>'s high-toned attack on mush-brained curricula is also a campaign for what might be called higher education, whose goal must be the routine production of highbrows, people who speak <PERSON>Mr. Bloom</PERSON>'s language. 

   Both <PERSON>Mr. Hirsch</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Bloom</PERSON> should consider recommending a new book that exemplifies the virtues they have been acclaiming -- and goes beyond them. 
W.V. <PERSON>Quine</PERSON>'s "Quiddities: An Intermittently Philosophical Dictionary" (<ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION>, 249 pages, <MONEY>$20</MONEY>) can be said, in a way, to follow the <PERSON>Hirsch</PERSON> method. 
It defines various concepts and lists them in alphabetical order, commencing, indeed, with "alphabet" and ending with "zero." 
These may sound too elementary for the Hirschite intent on expanding his vocabulary to include nominally intellectual shibboleths of use in the tohubohu of cocktail parties. 
But <PERSON>Mr. Quine</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Edgar Pierce Professor of Philosophy Emeritus</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> and arguably the leading philosophical mind in the world, has much to teach most people about alphabets and the meaning of zero. 
<PERSON>Mr. Bloom</PERSON> might find him too analytical, not interested enough in the history of philosophy as <PERSON>Mr. Bloom</PERSON> teaches it. 
But I think he would concede that <PERSON>Mr. Quine</PERSON> is an intellectual -- high, wide and handsome -- opening his mind to the rest of us here in a way that exemplifies the best of what a first-rate mind can do when aiming to explain himself to nonspecialists in mostly nontechnical language. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Quine</PERSON>, who has in his time changed the face of symbolic logic and ordinary language philosophy, here turns his mind to standard philosophical subjects such as free will, to topics in number theory and to matters of language. 
He has spent a lifetime making things clear, and the 85 mini-essays collected here are models of clarity in the discussion of difficult ideas. 
Some of the entries, especially those built on mathematical set theory, will make most people slow down and think hard, but even these sections are entertaining. 

   That is, perhaps, faint praise, too faint for the constant stream of wit and word play that <PERSON>Mr. Quine</PERSON> throws off as naturally as he breathes. 
<PERSON>Mr. Quine</PERSON> is a very funny man. 
He doesn't do it to please you and me so much as to please himself. 
He is someone who can see the humorous side to <ORGANIZATION>Fermat's Last Theorem</ORGANIZATION> without distorting its complexity. 
"Let me begin," he begins, "in the words of <PERSON>W.S. Gilbert</PERSON>, with a lot of news about the square on the hypotenuse." 
There follows an account of the "notorious" equation left behind unproved at his death by the French mathematician <ORGANIZATION>Pierre de Fermat</ORGANIZATION> (1601-65). 
The theorem purports to expand Pythagoras's formula for the square on the hypotenuse to cover all higher powers. 
After running us through the history of this famous conundrum, <PERSON>Mr. Quine</PERSON> adds a clever restatement of the idea put in terms of sorting objects into colored bins. 

   Every phrase in this book is a condensation of ideas usually stated at greater length, but <PERSON>Mr. Quine</PERSON> has the gift of turning the complex into the conversational without sanding off the edges. 
Often he sounds like the world's most intelligent stand-up comic. 
Here he is edging into a discussion of necessity: "'Must,' we are told, implies 'is.' 
Whatever is necessarily the case is the case. 
Yet I say 'He must be halfway home' precisely to allow for my missing my guess and his not being halfway home. 
Otherwise I would say 'He's halfway home' flat out. 
Clearly something must give, and what must give is 'must.' 
The word may express necessity half the time, but half the time it connotes precisely the lack of necessity, or the lack anyway of certainty. 'Must' is a law unto itself, if 'law' is the word I want." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Quine</PERSON>'s gift for fresh restatement crops up everywhere. 
On free will, he states neatly: "One is free, in the ordinary sense of the term, when one does as one likes or sees fit; and this is not altered by the fact, if fact it be, that what one likes or sees fit has had its causes . . . freedom to choose to do otherwise than one likes or sees fit would be a sordid boon." 

   It is impossible in this space to exhibit the full Quinian magic, the magnificent command of reasoning, pace, rhetoric and humor -- how in two pages he considers the traditional arguments justifying altruism as self-interest, finds them wanting, but does not see this as a threat to morality: "I say that such a justification would have been unworthy anyway, smacking of the venal and the sordid. 
Let virtue be its own reward." 
He draws the line, however, at altruism aimed at the welfare of subhuman species: "The human heart is distended until it is as big as all outdoors." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Quine</PERSON>'s own heart is actually a warmer and more capacious place than his life in numbers and syllogisms might make you think. 
He concludes "Altruism" with an appeal to human sympathy: ". . . there are uncharted moral wastes over which only our dim consciences, briefed by a conscientious assessment of probable consequences, are our faltering guides."

<LEADPARA>  TWO IMPORTANT celestial events are coming up shortly, on successive days in
fact, and each can provide a great opportunity for us and for our children to
learn more about the wonders of our solar system.;   In the early morning
hours of Saturday, Dec. 21, a small part of our moon will pass through the
shadow of the Earth. This partial eclipse of the moon is not as rare, nor will
it be as impressive, as the solar eclipse we witnessed last July, but it's a
wondrous event just the same. It can also serve as a teaching and learning
vehicle to help prepare us for some more-spectacular eclipses that will occur
during the new year.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  LUNAR ECLIPSE TO SHOW EARTH'S SHADOW  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Also ran in EX1/9, EX4/4, WL2; Education; Family Learning; Dr. William F.
Russell's books for parents and children include "Classics to Read Aloud to
Your Children" and "Classic Myths to Read Aloud."  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     To acquaint your children with the mechanics of a lunar eclipse, it may be
helpful to have a flashlight on hand, along with several common spheres, such
as a marble, a pingpong ball, a tennis ball or a grapefruit, that you can use
to represent the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and moon. By placing a marble or pingpong ball on a
table, and holding a lighted flashlight near the table's surface, you can
create a long shadow that extends from the object and narrows like a cone down
to a point. (This shadow is called the "umbra," from the Latin word for
"shadow," which is the root for our word "umbrella.");    THE EARTH casts this
same type of shadow in space -- 24 hours a day -- because the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> is always
standing in the path of some of the light from the sun. This circular shadow
is widest at the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s surface, and when people on the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> rotate into the
shadow, they refer to it as "night.";   From there, this same shadow stretches
approximately 850,000 miles out into space, but the circle gets smaller and
smaller before it narrows down to nothing. In all that immense distance,
however, there is only one object that the shadow can fall upon. Every once in
a while, our moon, which is whizzing around the Earth at nearly 2,280 mph,
will cross the path of this shadow, and some or all of the sunlight falling on
the moon's surface will be blocked out until the moon emerges from the shadow
once again.;   At <TIME>2 a.m. PST</TIME> on <DATE>Dec. 21</DATE>, the very bottom part of the moon will
touch the very top of this shadow, and by <TIME>2:33 a.m.</TIME>, almost <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> of the
moon will be hidden, while the remainder will be bathed in bright sunlight.;  
By using the flashlight and two of the spherical objects, you can demonstrate
why an eclipse can occur only during the time of a full moon. The moon has to
be in line with the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and the sun to enter the <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s shadow, and so
anyone on the "night" side of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> would see the moon fully lighted until
it touches that shadow.;   WHY DON'T we have an eclipse during every full
moon? Well, first of all, that alignment is tremendously precise. Think of
trying to align a grapefruit (the Earth), and a pingpong ball 12 feet away
(the moon), and a large house about a mile down the road (the sun). Even more
critical than this, however, is the fact that the moon doesn't orbit the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
on the same plane that the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbits the sun. The moon's orbit is tilted
about 5 degrees, and so the moon usually passes above or below the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s
shadow.;   When some ancient Greek thinkers, such as <ORGANIZATION>Pythagoras</ORGANIZATION> and Aristotle
many centuries ago, saw this phenomenon we call a "partial eclipse," they
noticed that no matter where in the sky the eclipse occurred, the shape of the
shadow on the moon was always curved in the arc of a circle. Through their
reasoning and logic alone, therefore, they concluded that the Earth could not
be flat, and must be a giant sphere.  </TEXT>

   AL-MATARIYA, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> (AP) _ Ancient <LOCATION>Heliopolis</LOCATION>, where legend says
the phoenix was resurrected from its own ashes, is buried or in
ruins. But like the fabulous bird that brought it fame, the city
itself is emerging from the ashes of time.
   Egyptian archaeologists are discovering remains under farmlands,
in the shadow of apartment high-rises, down alleyways and in
mid-campus at <ORGANIZATION>Ein Shams University</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``So much is left, but there's so much trouble getting to it,''
said <PERSON>Mohammed Abdel-Galil</PERSON>, chief antiquities inspector for
al-Matariya, a crowded suburb six miles north of downtown <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>. He
is heading the search for ancient <LOCATION>Heliopolis</LOCATION>, struggling to keep a
step ahead of a critical need for space to accommodate an exploding
population.
   The isolated temple columns, mud-brick houses, fallen obelisk,
decorated tombs with star-studded ceilings and pieces of mummies
hint of the glory of the lost spiritual center the Greeks named
<LOCATION>Heliopolis</LOCATION> _ City of the Sun. It honored the sun god Re, whose
temple complex dominated ancient <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s history.
   An elegant reminder of <LOCATION>Heliopolis</LOCATION>' past, an obelisk, stands in
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Central Park</LOCATION>. Its twin, the misnamed ``Cleopatra's
Needle,'' graces the bank of the <LOCATION>Thames River</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
   The most impressive <LOCATION>Heliopolis</LOCATION> remnant in its original home is a
solitary obelisk of red <LOCATION>Aswan</LOCATION> granite, erected almost 4,000 years
ago by Pharaoh Senwosret I. It weighs 121 tons and towers more than
67 feet above a quiet park amid the daily hubbub of modern life.
   Gamal Fares Abu-Fares, a young antiquities inspector, plucked a
blue faience statuette from a desecrated brick tomb more than 2,000
years old.
   ``Grave robbers took the valuable things and tossed relics like
this one aside,'' he said. ``The whole area is one vast cemetery.''
   Nearby, an angry-looking man paced back and forth _ the owner of
the construction site where the tomb was discovered.
   ``Every time we find another relic, he shakes his head,''
Abu-Fares said, explaining that it means the owner can do no work
until the excavators finish.
   By law, construction cannot begin in <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> without a permit from
the <ORGANIZATION>Egyptian Antiquities Organization</ORGANIZATION> certifying the site's
historical unimportance.
   In al-Matariya, where the probability is high of archaeological
significance, Abu-Fares spends part of each day riding through new
housing areas checking building permits. His reception can be far
from friendly.
   ``Sometimes, we get into fistfights,'' he said.
   Historians fear for the city whose intellect dazzled early
Mediterraneans. It gave the world the obelisk. Its mathematicians
and astronomers created a solar calendar, 365 days divided into 12
months.
   Ancient <PERSON>Heliopolis</PERSON>' high priests created a think tank that
beckoned the leading brains of the day: the law-giver Solon came, as
did the mathematician Pythagoras. Plato spent years absorbing
<LOCATION>Heliopolis</LOCATION>' storehouse of knowledge.
   The sprawling modern suburb that Cairenes know as <LOCATION>Heliopolis</LOCATION> lies
southeast of the ancient city, which covered what is now Al-Matariya
and nearby areas.
   For almost 3,000 years of pharaohs, <LOCATION>Heliopolis</LOCATION> stood undaunted,
bowing only to a brash young Macedonian, <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Great, who in
331 B.C. founded a rival city 130 miles to the north, <LOCATION>Alexandria</LOCATION>.
   By the time Christianity took hold more than 400 years later,
<LOCATION>Heliopolis</LOCATION> _ called ``On'' in the Old Testament _ was a ghost town.
Its remains were slowly covered by sand or they were carted away to
build the medieval city of <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>.
   In legend, ancient <LOCATION>Heliopolis</LOCATION> lives side-by-side with the
phoenix. That dying magical bird set fire to itself on the altar in
the great temple of Re, and a new phoenix would fly from the ashes
to heaven, a promise to the ancients of resurrection.
   But two years ago, the city became far more than legend to
construction workers digging the foundation for an engineering
school at <ORGANIZATION>Ein Shams University</ORGANIZATION>, named for the <DATE>spring</DATE> where ancient
Egyptians believed the sun took its daily baths <TIME>morning and night</TIME>.
   As they dug, they unearthed evidence of a tomb, the first of an
eventual 15 that archaeologists would find.
   On a recent day at the dig, a tin can sat on the ground, holding
hundreds of colorful mummy beads that once adorned the dead. Skulls,
pieces of mummies hacked by grave robbers searching for jewelry and
layers of mummy wrappings were clearly evident in the
cross-sectioned hillside, frozen in time.
   To the din of nearby construction, excavators gingerly removed
remains with picks and shovels.
   A mile away, inspectors are excavating a large cemetery with
tombs decorated for officials 2,500 years ago. Sarcophagi line
uneven ground where a high-rise had been planned.
   Al-Matariya's Abdel-Galil, a soft-spoken man, constantly tours
such excavation sites, trying to piece together the meaning of
relics saved from steam shovel and pile driver. His work takes him
bumping from one rocky road to another, from modern suburb to remote
village, a 10-minute trip through a time tunnel.
   He said the most important find so far is a mile-long double
mud-brick wall separating a suburb from farming fields. According to
surviving accounts of early travelers to ancient <LOCATION>Heliopolis</LOCATION>, the
wall stretched for more than three miles, surrounding an enormous
city.
   In a quiet village about a mile from the wall, Abdel-Galil walked
among columns heralding the exploits of pharaohs <ORGANIZATION>Ramses III</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Ramses IV</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We think a large temple of <ORGANIZATION>Ramses III</ORGANIZATION> is near here, maybe under
the fields,'' Abdel-Galil said. ``We have to find out, but we have
problems. The villagers don't have a sense of history.''

   ATLANTA -- <PERSON>Ollie Smith</PERSON>'s third-graders are willing.
   "The number is 2,427," says <PERSON>Mrs. Smith</PERSON>, a teacher at
<ORGANIZATION>Cleveland Avenue Elementary School</ORGANIZATION> here. An eager volunteer,
one of 17 blacks in a class of 18, walks to the blackboard
beneath the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> flag in a scene familiar to anyone -- until
the chalk moves.
   Instead of the numeral 2, the girl draws two lotus
flowers, followed by four coiled ropes, two oxen yokes, and
seven vertical strokes.
   "Very good, <PERSON>Jeannette</PERSON>," says <PERSON>Mrs. Smith</PERSON>, praising a
perfect rendition of 2,427 in ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.
"You can take your seat."
   <PERSON>Mrs. Smith</PERSON>'s arithmetic lesson is part of a new
Africa-centered curriculum that is fast spreading in urban
schools. <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, are in various stages of similar
course-content changes that stress, to a high degree, the
history and culture of black people.
   This approach, sometimes called "Afrocentric," claims that
typical school textbooks have played down or outright ignored
black scholars, writers and mathematicians. One of a set of
essays used in Afrocentrist curricula sees "the vision of the
African people as being the wellspring of creativity and
knowledge on which the foundation of all science, technology
and engineering rests, and draws continuing inspiration."
   Many prominent scholars say the claims of the
Afrocentrists are grossly inaccurate, as well as racially
inflammatory. According to the Afrocentric essays, for
example, Cleopatra was black and the rich culture of ancient
<LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> was largely African. That's why <PERSON>Mrs. Smith</PERSON>'s students
learn hieroglyphics.
   But to say that <PERSON>Cleopatra</PERSON> was a black "is baloney," says
<PERSON>Frank Yurco</PERSON>, an expert on ancient <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> at <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Field
Museum</ORGANIZATION>, who says the record of her Greek and Macedonian
lineage is well established. <PERSON>Mr. Yurco</PERSON> adds that to suggest,
as the teaching guides do, "that <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> derived from <LOCATION>Central
Africa</LOCATION> is a major distortion."
   Still, in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, the first black majority district to
introduce an African-oriented curriculum in all its schools,
there is mounting evidence of educational gains.
   Many principals and teachers say students are taking more
interest in school and raising their aspirations since the
African Infusion Project started. In 17 schools that piloted
"infusion" in the 1989-90 school year, the percentage of
students scoring at or above norms on standardized reading
and math tests rose by a higher rate than in the system as a
whole. Average attendance at the 17 schools rose by about a
percentage point to <PERCENT>91.5%</PERCENT>, catching up with the overall
district rate after trailing it in <DATE>1988-89</DATE>.
   "We have seen positive results," says <PERSON>Eunice Robinson</PERSON>, the
principal of <LOCATION>Cleveland Avenue</LOCATION>, where students at or above
reading norms shot up to <PERCENT>64%</PERCENT> of enrollment in the <DATE>spring of
1990</DATE>, from <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT>. <PERSON>Sherman Lofton</PERSON>, principal of <ORGANIZATION>Brown High
School</ORGANIZATION> in one of <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>'s poorer black neighborhoods, adds:
"It really helps kids with their self-esteem. We've got more
saying they want to go to college and training school."
   Curriculum change is one of many new efforts aimed at
improving the education of black children, especially in the
inner cities, where traditional methods don't seem to be
working. In the 37 years since the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> struck down
segregated schools, blacks have narrowed the educational gap
with whites, but still lag badly in college-admissions and
other test scores, graduation and college-going rates.
   Proposed remedies are becoming more radical. Some blacks
favor vouchers they could use at private schools. <LOCATION>Milwaukee</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> have considered schools exclusively for
black boys that would concentrate on providing role models
and other help. Ironically, they must overcome the legal
legacy of the desegregation decision to get them started.
   Proponents of Afrocentrism say it offers something for all
schools. In <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, the first major system to endorse
increased African input, <PERCENT>74%</PERCENT> of students are white. The
school board there plans to add American Indian, Hispanic and
Asian course plans to the African-American Baseline Essays,
or teaching guides, that already have been developed.
   Atlanta and other cities with African approaches haven't
focused on curricula tailored to other minorities. They are
merely trying to more effectively address large black
majorities.
   The mere notion, though, that any school would tailor its
curriculum to an ethnic group draws many critics. <PERSON>Diane
Ravitch</PERSON>, an educational historian and the new <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>
nominee to head research at the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Education</ORGANIZATION>, says
much of what is being done under the Afrocentric banner is
"teaching racial antagonism." What's more, she says, "To say
you're going to make another continent the center of your
curriculum, and center science, math and English around this
continent, is pedagogically unsound."
   Rising test scores don't make her feel any better about
it. "White southerners used to say to me, `We get the best
test scores in segregated schools. Why integrate?'" she
observes. "If we discovered that apartheid produced higher
test scores, would that make apartheid a good system?"
   But <PERSON>Asa Hilliard</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Georgia State University</ORGANIZATION> professor and
consultant on Africa-oriented learning, says, "There is a
massive amount of validated non-trivial data about <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>
that is missing from schools, data without which the general
events in many areas of content can't be understood. I simply
advocate that the record be researched and the most truthful
picture possible be given in the curriculum. I don't think
that can be done without including African and black people
in every subject."
   In many ways, the <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> public schools are an ideal
crucible for the Afrocentric approach. Enrollment, now about
59,600, has been declining for years, first because of white
flight from desegregation and more recently because of a low
opinion by the public, both white and black, of school
quality. The system is as Afro-American as they come: <PERCENT>92%</PERCENT> of
students and <PERCENT>93%</PERCENT> of staff are black. Test scores,
college-enrollment and dropout rates are consistently among
the worst in <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>. Alarmed, business and school leaders
have launched studies of the problem. Afrocentrism emerged
from one of them.
   Teachers participating in the Afrocentric curriculum in
<LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> insist they are getting across the traditional
information all students need. In <PERSON>Mrs. Smith</PERSON>'s class at
<LOCATION>Cleveland Avenue</LOCATION>, each drill in hieroglyphics also conveys
something about addition. When a student writes 214 as <PERSON>King
Tut</PERSON> did, for example, her classmates recite together, "200
plus 10 plus four."
   Similarly, in an African geography lesson at <ORGANIZATION>Sutton Middle
School</ORGANIZATION>, students demonstrate knowledge that might be useful
in a broader sphere. "What's a word for a high, flat land
mass?" asks <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Stanley</ORGANIZATION>, a sixth-grade teacher.
"Plateau," says one of many students with hands up.
Classmates quickly define arid tracts as deserts, find the
Strait of <LOCATION>Gibraltar</LOCATION> on a world map, and relate how sleepiness
induced by the bite of tse-tse fly kills both cattle and
people. <PERSON>Ms. Stanley</PERSON>'s students, about a third of whom are
white, later get a lesson about a Medieval pilgrimage to
Mecca by <PERSON>Mansa Mussa</PERSON>, king of <LOCATION>Mali</LOCATION>.
   In teaching from a black perspective, though, the <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>
schools do cover material many white adults don't know. They
also prompt black students to consider racial questions they
might not otherwise ponder. When world history teacher <PERSON>Jill
Beracki</PERSON> guides her tenth-grade class at <ORGANIZATION>Frederick Douglass
High School</ORGANIZATION> through the Industrial Revolution, familiar
themes are explored. But the tour also goes by way of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>
with a major stopover in the African diaspora.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Beracki</PERSON> wants to know "why <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> led the way" in
industrialization, and her students respond. "Skilled labor
force," says one. Government policies and naval prowess are
discussed. Then discussion turns to sources of raw materials
in British colonies and other matters. When, 10 minutes into
the period, <PERSON>Mrs. Beracki</PERSON> asks what role blacks played in the
Industrial Revolution, her students say it can't be found in
the textbook.
   "This book is written from a European point-of-view," says
student <ORGANIZATION>Emanuel Easter</ORGANIZATION> matter-of-factly. "It doesn't really
focus on black Americans." Classmate <PERSON>Tommy Phillips</PERSON> agrees.
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, he says, gets "two whole chapters" in this unit.
"<LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> and the whole rest of the world is just one
little section."
   "For some reason," <PERSON>Mrs. Beracki</PERSON> tells the class, "black
Americans have been omitted from the history of
industrialization. As a compensation, I've asked you to do
some reports on black inventors." There is no lack of raised
hands when <PERSON>Mrs. Beracki</PERSON> asks for someone to start.
   Emanuel tells of <PERSON>Garrett Morgan</PERSON>, a Clevelander who created
the first traffic light and gas mask. Makila Sands did her
report on <PERSON>Elijah McCoy</PERSON>, possibly the namesake for the "real
McCoy," she says, because his automatic machine lubricator
was much copied but never replicated. A somewhat
self-conscious student gets up and turns to face the class.
"I want to tell you about <PERSON>James Matzeliger</PERSON>," he says with a
nervous stutter. "He was born in <LOCATION>Lynn</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1852</DATE>. . . .
He made Lynn the shoe capital of the world. . . . They
couldn't make a machine to sew soles to last. People said it
was impossible to make such a machine."
   But <PERSON>James Matzeliger</PERSON>, a black man, did it.
   Much research shows that students do better when schools
involve parents and the community in education. One of the
goals of the Afro-based curriculum is to improve this
involvement in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, where the black community is the main
one served by public schools.
   One bright chilly morning, 17 community volunteers gather
in the library of <LOCATION>Cleveland Avenue Elementary</LOCATION>, making
preparations for a day of African storytelling and readings
of black American poetry. Some wear the colorful native garb
of <LOCATION>Nigeria</LOCATION>, but others sport a more conventional business
look. That's more important than middle-class people might
know, says <PERSON>Eunice Robinson</PERSON>, the principal.
   "We have children who don't usually see black males in
suits and ties," she says. "This give them a chance to see
that black males don't all shoot dope. These kids can tell
you what the dope dealer wears, and what he drives, but they
can't tell you how a black businessman is supposed to look."
   Dispersing to the classrooms, the volunteers read aloud
tales such as "Why Mosquitoes Buzz in Peoples' Ears" and "How
the Rabbit Lost His Tail." <PERSON>Brieu Madison</PERSON>, a local college
student, dons a housedress and head scarf to play a sarcastic
mother, rousing a lazy child from sleep in the <PERSON>Paul Laurence
Dunbar</PERSON> poem "In the Morning." Avid fifth-graders come forward
to act alongside her, and a tangle of hands shoots up when
<PERSON>Ms. Madison</PERSON> asks for comment on a <PERSON>Langston Hughes</PERSON> poem.
   After applauding, several students wonder aloud what it
might be like to be an actor. <ORGANIZATION>Nse Ufot</ORGANIZATION>, a fifth grade fan,
pens an acrostic to <PERSON>Ms. Madison</PERSON>, using her first name:
"Brilliant, Radiant . . . Important . . . Enthusiastic,
Unbeatable."
   Infusion has altered what goes on in many <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>
classrooms, but as with any major curricular change,
implementation has been spotty. In the 1989-1990 school year,
17 pilot schools were supposed to redesign their curriculum
at every grade, while five others were picked to introduce
the program in selected classes. For the year just ended, the
entire system was supposed to be "infusing" at every grade
level in every subject, but the district admits that outside
of math and social studies, implementation has been spotty.
   Afrocentrism isn't merely changing content, but methods as
well. In subjects like history and English, black and African
contributions can be included without much altering the way
subject matter is covered. It's merely a matter of changing
some of the people and literature studied.
   But in science and math, the fit is more difficult. At
<LOCATION>Cleveland Avenue</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mrs. Smith</PERSON>'s students learn Egyptian
numerals before Roman numerals. The system also wants
teachers to personalize math and science. Geometry is
traditionally covered with only a passing reference to <LOCATION>Euclid</LOCATION>
and Pythagoras; but <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> wants black mathematicians and
their contributions not only to be mentioned, but to serve as
a pivot for lessons.
   In a fifth-grade class, teacher <PERSON>Loretta Palmer</PERSON> readies a
special lesson. "We're going to take a lesson in math and
social studies together," she announces. "Our lesson is going
to be about time, with someone who was very concerned with
time" -- <PERSON>Benjamin Banneker</PERSON>, mathematician and maker of the
first clock in colonial <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>.
   At any opportunity, <PERSON>Mrs. Palmer</PERSON> strives to include a black
message. When subtraction exercises concern a boy who is
always late, she tells her children "Benjamin Banneker loved
to be on time." With the objective of the day -- "Solve a
problem involving time" -- on the blackboard, she tells the
class, "That's part of your great heritage, to be there on
time."
   After class, <PERSON>Mrs. Robinson</PERSON>, the principal, asks the
children to talk about their black and African-American
heroes and knowledge. Adrian, an irrepressible contributor,
says his hero is "King Tut -- he was king of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>."
   Turning phrases like a practiced orator, young <PERSON>Daron
Walters</PERSON> says what he knows: "<LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> has been going on for
millions and millions of years. I know this because of
stories I have read. I have learned about great men who ruled
1,363 years before Christ, and seen masks that men made
before Christ was born." When asked who some of these
pre-Christian kings were, he mentions "<PERSON>Shaka Zulu</PERSON>." It is an
error. Shaka was indeed a Zulu king, but of the <DATE>19th century</DATE>
A.D.
   Returning to her office, <PERSON>Mrs. Robinson</PERSON> is beaming with
pride, but feeling somewhat apologetic. "When you hear my
children, you hear wrong answers," says <PERSON>Mrs. Robinson</PERSON>. "I
hear answers where there were no answers before."

JOURNEY THROUGH GENIUS: THE GREAT THEOREMS OF MATHEMATICS BY WILLIAM DUNHAM

<P>
Reviewing a book a week doesn't allow much time to stop and dawdle, but 
"Journey Through Genius" is one that I wanted to savor for a while. It's a very 
special math book, as good as any popular book in the subject sincT. Bell wrote 
"Men of Mathematics" in <DATE>1937</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
There's probably no such thing as a math book for people who don't like 
mathematics, but "Journey Through Genius" comes close. <PERSON>William Dunham</PERSON>, a 
mathematician at <ORGANIZATION>Hanover College</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, has written an inspired piece of 
intellectual history that explains a dozen of the greatest theorems in the 
history of mathematics, placing them in their historical contexts in the larger 
world as well as in the narrower world of pure thought. 
</P>
<P>
For example, his chapter on <ORGANIZATION>Euclid</ORGANIZATION>'s proof of the Pythagorean theorem ("In a 
right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares 
of the other two sides") gives a rounded synopsis of the history of mathematics 
and the history of <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION> before turning to <LOCATION>Euclid</LOCATION>, geometry and right 
triangles. 
</P>
<P>
To get to the Pythagorean theorem, which is the 47th proposition in the first 
book of Euclid's "Elements," <PERSON>Dunham</PERSON> marches straight through the first 46 
propositions, arguing that the 47th is the emotional climax, the theorem to 
which all the others point. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the chapter on <PERSON>Isaac Newton</PERSON>, which includes a terrific description 
of <ORGANIZATION>Newton</ORGANIZATION>'s approximation of pi, begins by placing <ORGANIZATION>Newton</ORGANIZATION> in the same century 
as <PERSON>Cervantes</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION>, as well as <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Descartes</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Pascal</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Fermat</ORGANIZATION>. 
Logarithms were perfected and introduced just before <PERSON>Newton</PERSON> was born in <DATE>1642</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
(The book has a welcome paragraph on logarithms. We who take pocket calculators 
and computers for granted should recall this early and very successful method 
for speeding up arithmetic. A century later, Pierre-Simon <LOCATION>Laplace</LOCATION> observed that 
logarithms "by shortening the labors doubled the life of the astronomer." By 
what factor have computers lengthened scientists' lives today?) 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Dunham</PERSON>'s project is to treat mathematics like an art form: Just as great 
novels, great symphonies and great paintings are the objects of study in 
appreciating literature, music and art, theorems are the appropriate objects of 
study in appreciating mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
When he describes the actual proof of the theorem, the timeless logical insight 
that solved a problem in pure thought, <PERSON>Dunham</PERSON>'s descriptions are crystal clear. 
Not all of them are easy (<PERSON>Cardano</PERSON> and the solution of the cube and <PERSON>Cantor</PERSON>'s 
investigation of the transfinite realm, for example). 
</P>
<P>
But they all reward effort. They are written for interested, non-specialist 
readers -- preferably those who enjoyed high school math and remember some of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Dunham notes that mathematics is built on the twin pillars of arithmetic and 
geometry -- numbers and space -- and they have alternately held sway as long as 
people have thought about such things. As a result, the book embraces geometry 
(<ORGANIZATION>Archimedes</ORGANIZATION>' "On the Sphere and the Cylinder") and numbers (<ORGANIZATION>Euler</ORGANIZATION>'s number 
theory). In each case, <PERSON>Dunham</PERSON> lucidly describes the problem and then equally 
lucidly presents the ingenious solution. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike any other sphere of human inquiry, the truths of mathematics, once 
proved, are proved forever. They do not rest on experiment or judgment or 
opinion. They rest on naked logic. 
</P>
<P>
In general, we think of Greek science as quaint, if anything, but we read 
Euclid with awe. Twenty-three centuries later, its beauty is still compelling. 
</P>
<P>
Dunham's book captures and conveys the power behind mathematical proof. 
Mathematics is the science of pure thought. I shudder to think it. 
</P>
<P>
The book contains a fair amount about the characters who do mathematics. It 
takes a special kind of person to muck about in naked logic, and these 
peculiarities sometimes manifest themselves in other aspects of mathematicians' 
lives. They tend to be odd people. 
</P>
<P>
But most important is their work. Having opened up for examination a dozen 
great theorems, <PERSON>Dunham</PERSON> wonders what about them makes them great and concludes, 
with <PERSON>G. H. Hardy</PERSON>, that they possess "economy, inevitability and 
unexpectedness." 
</P>
<P>
In that sense, too, mathematics is like art. The combination of inevitability 
and unexpectedness packs unbeatable emotional appeal. 
</P>
<P>
OK. So this isn't a book for everyone. I wish it were. But for those who like 
this sort of thing, this book is a gem. 
</P>
<P>
Next: <PERSON>Jonathan Kirsch</PERSON> reviews "Shark Tank: Greed, Politics and the Collapse of 
Finley Kumble" by <PERSON>Kim Isaac Eisler</PERSON>.

JIM MURRAY: A NECESSITY FOR MAKING SUPER BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't look now but events over the weekend in pro football seem to give ringing 
endorsement to one of my long-cherished <ORGANIZATION>Murray's Laws of Athletic Probability</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
You all know what these laws are, if you've been paying attention: propositions 
as immutable as <ORGANIZATION>Pythagoras</ORGANIZATION>' Theorem. 
</P>
<P>
You may not ordinarily think of me as a man of science -- I have trouble 
opening a fuse box -- but when it comes to sports behavior I am infallible. I 
have decades of observable phenomena to verify me. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, who can quarrel with <PERSON>Murray</PERSON>'s Law of geographic probability: 
"Whatever can go to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, will?" That is as demonstrably true as the rule 
of geometry that sides opposite equal angles are equal. Even its corollary is 
true: "Whatever can go to <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, won't." 
</P>
<P>
Then, there is the tried and true <PERSON>Murray</PERSON>'s Law that, "On any obvious passing 
situation late in an <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> game, the quarterback can help himself to 15 to 20 
yards anytime he wants." This happens so often, the point need not be 
belabored. 
</P>
<P>
But what has heartened me considerably over this past week is the prove-out of 
one of <ORGANIZATION>Murray</ORGANIZATION>'s All-Time Pet Laws. It is this: "Quarterbacks get you to the 
Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Now, I admit it does not have the ring of basic theorems of history as, "The 
square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares 
of the other two sides," but it is, nonetheless, equally valid and provable. 
</P>
<P>
Look at the Super Bowl tournament. Every team in it has a prime quarterback on 
hand. As usual. 
</P>
<P>
Let's examine what we have: <PERSON>Joe Montana</PERSON>? Well, of course. What more do you need 
to say? He comes with the Super Bowl. If he ain't in it, it ain't a Super Bowl. 
<PERSON>John Elway</PERSON>? Natch! Here's a guy who has put mediocre teams in <LOCATION>Super Bowls</LOCATION>. 
Elway is the most perfect proof of <ORGANIZATION>Murray</ORGANIZATION>'s Law there is. Can you think of any 
other reason why <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> is always in a Super Bowl -- or right next to it? 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bernie Kosar</PERSON>. Look! This may be the really smartest quarterback in the game. He 
unloads the ball in a kind of ungainly sidearm motion like a guy dropping a 
suitcase, but let me tell you something, <PERSON>Stan Musial</PERSON> didn't have the best 
batting form you ever saw. Neither did <PERSON>Ty Cobb</PERSON>. Kosar's passes look just fine 
on a scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jim Everett</PERSON>? Well, he's a relative newcomer, some would say untried. But let me 
put it this way -- is there another quarterback besides the ones we've already 
mentioned who's any better? <PERSON>Dan Marino</PERSON>? Perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
The history of the Super Bowl is, you go there, so to speak, on the arm. 
Certainly, not the hoof. 
</P>
<P>
Check the records: The only possibly unqualified QB in the long history of the 
Super Bowl might be <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>David Woodley</PERSON> in <DATE>1983</DATE>. No one ever mixed <PERSON>David</PERSON> up 
with <PERSON>Sammy Baugh</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
For the rest, there was almost always a legend or semi-legend in the irons. 
<PERSON>Fran Tarkenton</PERSON> used to get his team in the Super Bowl. <PERSON>Joe Namath</PERSON> did it. <PERSON>Bart 
Starr</PERSON> did it. <PERSON>Lenny Dawson</PERSON>. <PERSON>Roger Staubach</PERSON>. <PERSON>Otto Graham</PERSON> would have. 
</P>
<P>
It's the one constant in a Super Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
None of this appears to rub off on general managers. Given the presence of 
all-hype running backs in the <DATE>spring</DATE> draft, they fall all over themselves to 
pick up 1,000-yard runners, Heisman winners, speed freaks. They usually pass up 
quarterbacks. "Not a good year for QB's," they usually sniff. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Have you noticed <PERSON>Eric Dickerson</PERSON> isn't even in the Super Bowl hunt? Never 
is. Neither is <PERSON>Herschel Walker</PERSON>. <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> gave up everything short of the state 
capitol to get him. It didn't help. They didn't get to the Super Bowl finals 
because <PERSON>Wade Wilson</PERSON> is not as good as the quarterbacks who did. 
</P>
<P>
It would not be fair to say running backs don't matter. It's just that they're 
not critical. They're nice to have, but you don't need them. You don't need a 
Galloping Ghost. A competent experienced 4.6-speed runner will do if the game 
plan is artful enough. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bo Jackson</PERSON> isn't in a Super Bowl. <PERSON>Earl Campbell</PERSON> never made one -- and if <PERSON>Earl 
Campbell</PERSON> can't put you in a Super Bowl, no running back can. 
</P>
<P>
The old <ORGANIZATION>Dallas Cowboys</ORGANIZATION> used to have <PERSON>Calvin Hill</PERSON> and <PERSON>Duane Thomas</PERSON>, but the Super 
Bowls came with <PERSON>Roger Staubach</PERSON>. <PERSON>Franco Harris</PERSON> ran nice with the football, but 
<PERSON>Terry Bradshaw</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lynn Swann</PERSON> won four Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>O.J. Simpson</PERSON> never made a Super Bowl. <PERSON>Barry Sanders</PERSON>, as great a year as he had, 
isn't in a Super Bowl or even a playoff. <PERSON>Walter Payton</PERSON> got in a Super Bowl in 
his dotage. And a quarterback, <PERSON>Jim McMahon</PERSON>, put the team there, not <PERSON>Walter</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
There have been Super Bowls -- <DATE>1985</DATE>, <LOCATION>San Francisco-Miami</LOCATION>, and <DATE>1988</DATE>, 
Washington-Denver, come to mind -- where everybody in the country knew the 
quarterbacks but hardly anyone could name the starting (or backup) running 
backs. Come to think of it, who were the running backs last year? 
</P>
<P>
If running got you to the Super Bowl, the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> would have gotten by the Rams 
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>. Deacon Jones, when he was the definitive defensive end for the <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION>, 
always used to tell me: "We don't worry about the run -- we'll never get beat 
by the run." 
</P>
<P>
I rest my case. I would remind you <PERSON>Joe Montana</PERSON> wasn't selected until the third 
round of the <DATE>1979</DATE> draft. <PERSON>Johnny Unitas</PERSON> was working on a steamshovel when he was 
picked up. 
</P>
<P>
I don't expect any of this to have any influence on front offices. They have a 
long history of resisting my well-intentioned advice. But can I tell you 
something? The <ORGANIZATION>Seattle Seahawks</ORGANIZATION> have never drafted a quarterback No. 1. That 
may tell you all you have to know about the <LOCATION>Seattle Seahawks</LOCATION>. The <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bills 
drafted only one quarterback No. 1 in their history. Their first year, they 
drafted <PERSON>Richie Lucas</PERSON> out of <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>New Orleans Saints</ORGANIZATION> drafted only one 
quarterback No. 1 in their existence, <PERSON>Archie Manning</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Ole Miss</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Dave Wilson</PERSON> 
was a supplemental No. 1 choice. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to go to <ORGANIZATION>Carnegie Hall</ORGANIZATION>, practice. If you want to go to the Super 
Bowl, turn right at the quarterback. That's <ORGANIZATION>Murray's Fourth Law of Football</ORGANIZATION>. 
And I didn't need an apple to fall on my head.

   For One Reagan,
   You Can Get Many
   Mikki Williamses
   ---
   She Is on the Speaker Circuit
   With Other No-Names
   Seeking Fees and Applause

   HOUSTON -- Mikki Williams stalks the gym floor in spiked
heels, microphone in hand, her audience of 80 exercise
instructors idly noshing carrots and cantaloupe.
   She scans the gathering and decides on a warm-up joke: "I
broke up with my fiance the other day," she says. "He asked,
`Is there someone else?' I said, `There just must be.' "
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Groans and laughs rise from the crowd; <PERSON>Ms. Williams</PERSON> seems
cheered. She moves quickly into her sermon about projecting a
positive attitude. She tells the instructors to put rubber
bands on their wrists, stretch them, let them snap, and then
chant, "I will stretch beyond my limits." She hands out
Play-Doh and advises to mold it "as you would your life."
   <PERSON>Ms. Williams</PERSON>, a former caterer and now a professional
speaker, admits she is no Abe Lincoln. Billing herself as an
"Enthusiologist," and relying on a mix of motivational
cliches, old jokes and personal anecdotes, the 47-year-old
widow scratches out a living on the rubber-chicken circuit,
landing about 80 appearances a year in front of small
companies and trade groups starved for a pep talk. "I get a
chance to impact peoples' lives," she explains. "That's a
great opportunity."
   For every <PERSON>Norman Schwarzkopf</PERSON> or <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON> raking
in highly publicized speaking fees of up to <MONEY>$80,000</MONEY> per
banquet, hundreds of low-budget lecturers like <PERSON>Ms. Williams</PERSON>
claw to be heard on everything from algebra-made-easy to Zen
dentistry. On any given night, up to 7,000 speakers step up
to podiums in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> -- <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT> of them for pay -- according to
estimates by booking agents. Some 70,000 would-be keynoters
are chasing those jobs, and 300 hopefuls sign up with local
speakers bureaus every week.
   "Most are incompetent, but they hear about the occasional
big money and want in on it," says <PERSON>John Palmer</PERSON>, who finds new
speaking talent for business groups in the <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> area. He
recently scouted the speech of a rookie -- a farmer
addressing agricultural suppliers, all of whom seemed to be
dozing off. Suddenly, to regain their attention, the farmer
broke out into assorted bird calls. "Embarrassing," says <PERSON>Mr.
Palmer</PERSON>, who got in line for the exit.
   No-name lecturers like <PERSON>Ms. Williams</PERSON> are in a tough fight
for the after-dinner crumbs left by the likes of former
President <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON>, who still gets <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> a speech;
commentator <PERSON>Henry Kissinger</PERSON> at <MONEY>$20,000</MONEY>; and ex-Miami Dolphin
fullback <PERSON>Larry Csonka</PERSON>, at <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY>. Zsa <PERSON>Zsa Gabor</PERSON>'s famous
cop-slapping incident more than doubled her speaking fee to
<MONEY>$25,000</MONEY> a pop, agents say.
   In contrast, <PERSON>Ms. Williams</PERSON> speaks for a negotiable fee of a
few hundred dollars, plus expenses. True, her advertised
price is <MONEY>$3,500</MONEY>. "But anyone who says they get their fee
every time is lying," she says.
   <PERSON>Leslie Scott</PERSON>, who hired <PERSON>Ms. Williams</PERSON> to speak to the
exercise instructors, describes her as "inspiring and a lot
of fun." But best of all, she admits, <PERSON>Ms. Williams</PERSON>'s talk is
cheap.
   Getting any fee is tough for some. Just ask <PERSON>Tony
Weissgarber</PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> fighter pilot who has
unsuccessfully advertised in this newspaper for lecture gigs.
"Can't Book `Stormin' Norman?' Then get `Big T]' " say his
ads, picturing him in Desert Storm fatigues even though his
war was <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Weissgarber</PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, says the ads have brought only a free speech to the
local <ORGANIZATION>Rotary Club</ORGANIZATION>. He did it to make contacts. When other
prospects learn his asking price is <MONEY>$3,500</MONEY>, "They say, `We'll
get back to you,' but they don't," he sighs.
   Booking agents say hiring unknowns in the raconteur racket
can be disastrous. <PERSON>Steve Finkelmeyer</PERSON>, who books speakers for
clients of <ORGANIZATION>Burson-Marstellar</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> public relations
firm, says he unsuspectingly paid <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> for a recently
retired corporate chairman to talk to a group of travel
industry executives in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>. "But he starts out with some
extremely off-color jokes painfully delivered, mispronounces
executives names and wishes the company a happy <DATE>30th
birthday</DATE>, when in fact its anniversary was the previous
year," he recalls.
   Let's look at an after-dinner Who's Who of the
uncelebrated and the curious, all ready to address anyone at
the clink of a spoon on a wine glass.
   -- Gen. <PERSON>George Patton</PERSON>: Okay, so he's really just former
high-school principal <PERSON>Merlin James</PERSON> from <LOCATION>Fort Myers</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>,
with a raspy-voiced impersonation of <PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON>'s <DATE>1970</DATE>
movie role. But he brings his own huge American flag as a
stage prop, and his uniform is authentic right down to the
handmade tank boots. Like the late general, he's abrasive.
"I'm an egotistical S.O.B. and people who get to see me are
lucky." All for <MONEY>$2,500</MONEY>.
   -- The Hug Lady: <PERSON>Patricia Tice</PERSON> teaches workers how to
cooperate with outstretched arms. She has the audience stand
together "and pretend your hands are human brushes in a car
wash. It's relaxing." Later she will "hug everyone there.
It's their option of course," she says. She is a former <LOCATION>Des
Moines</LOCATION> elementary school counselor. Fee: <MONEY>$1,500</MONEY>.
   -- The Numerologist: "That's professional numerologist,"
corrects <PERSON>Kathy Bury</PERSON>, who reads the future in numbers the way
astrologists analyze the stars. "There aren't any bad
numbers. Just bad decisions," she says. <PERSON>Ms. Bury</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Golden</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>, says her methods are based on the theories of
<LOCATION>Pythagoras</LOCATION>, the Greek mathematician. One number she's
flexible on is her <MONEY>$1,500</MONEY> fee. Special discounts for
cruise-ship gigs.
   -- The <PERSON>Dieter</PERSON>: "Love your fat away," proclaims <PERSON>Aliza
Guggenheim</PERSON>, a former cab driver in suburban <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> who once
lost 176 pounds. True, she gained it all back. But that was
before she learned the "selflove" she now preaches for a
skinny <MONEY>$100</MONEY> fee. Today she weighs 145, down 128 pounds. She
composes such poetic lines as, "Subconsciously hiding behind
this hideous fat; scaring people away like an ugly gray rat."
   -- The Hypnotist: <PERSON>Walter Garbisch</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Milwaukee</LOCATION> is both a
hypnotist and a <PERSON>Mark Twain</PERSON> impersonator. His fee for either
is <MONEY>$500</MONEY>. He will do <PERSON>Mark Twain</PERSON> as a hypnotist but cautions
that such a presentation "isn't authentic." Says he has
hypnotized more than 7,000 volunteers from audiences. His
surest way to get laughs: tell the hypnotizee "to pretend
he's at a funny movie."
   -- The Artist: <PERSON>Conni Gordon</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Miami Beach</LOCATION> has everyone in
the audience paint a landscape in just one hour to inspire
corporate creativity. But some pupils just don't get it. She
once told several <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines Corp.</ORGANIZATION>
managers to paint the tops of their canvases sky blue. "They
painted the upper rim where the canvas fits into the frame,"
she says in frustration. Also teaches finger painting. Fee:
<MONEY>$3,000</MONEY>.
   -- The Coach: <PERSON>Ray Pelletier</PERSON> bills himself as "<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s
Attitude Coach," but he's more of a cheerleader. When you
phone him in <LOCATION>Coral Gables</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, his receptionist greets you
with, "Hi, have a better than terrific day." Then the on-hold
recording features <PERSON>Mr. Pelletier</PERSON> saying the same thing.
Finally, he comes on the line and tells you in real life that
he's still "better than terrific." An hour of this live:
<MONEY>$4,000</MONEY>.
   -- The Dental Hygienist: <PERSON>Patricia Burger</PERSON>, a 22-year
veteran of cleaning teeth in suburban <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, addresses
mainly dentists and their assistants on "dental career crisis
and burnout." She says, "After cleaning teeth for a while,
you start to wonder if that's all there is." Also lectures on
acupuncture. Fee: <MONEY>$300</MONEY>. Likes to be paid in advance:
"Dentists are cheap; I'm divorced from one."
   Speakers like this do, of course, have their fans. <PERSON>Gail
Bourne</PERSON>, an aerobics teacher who paid <MONEY>$49</MONEY> to hear <PERSON>Ms. Williams</PERSON>
quote everyone from Confucius to singer <LOCATION>Whitney Houston</LOCATION>, says
she got a lift from the talk. "I have heard worse, with my
husband at a convention of accountants," she says. "They sit
through anything."

What to do with a pet while vacationing? It's a sticky question, one that 
<PERSON>Dorothy McCorkle</PERSON> of La Crescenta referred to in a letter <DATE>last Sunday</DATE>. We've 
come up with some additional details. The group of sitters she mentioned will 
volunteer to look after your dog/cat while you're away. Or any other animal, 
bird or fish that shares your roof. These are sitters who care for pets at the 
owner's home. Besides the pets, the sitters pick up mail, water plants and even

FT  26 NOV 94 / Private View: The mathematician in his cave - Christian
Tyler meets a man whose beliefs about human understanding are causing
scientific controversy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among mathematicians, Sir <PERSON>Roger Penrose</PERSON> is a caveman. I do not mean he is
some snaggle-toothed evolutionary throwback - even if certain high priests
of brain science would call him that.
He is a caveman because he agrees with <PERSON>Plato</PERSON>, who first used the analogy
that human beings are like prisoners in a cave who can see only the shadows
of reality thrown on to the wall by the firelight.
For <PERSON>Penrose</PERSON>, mathematical truths are part of reality: not human inventions,
but pre-existing 'forms' whose existence we have to discover.
He has reworked <ORGANIZATION>Plato</ORGANIZATION>'s parable for the prologue of his second book, Shadows
of the Mind, which restates and develops the controversial claim of The
Emperor's New Mind that human understanding will never be explained in terms
of computer-like calculations.
Human consciousness cannot even be simulated by a machine. Furthermore, the
scientific explanation for consciousness will depend on discovering new laws
of physics.
The cave of the <ORGANIZATION>Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Oxford University</ORGANIZATION> is
satisfyingly chaotic. Papers, books and correspondence crammed the room at
the <ORGANIZATION>Mathematical Institute</ORGANIZATION>, a faded new block on <ORGANIZATION>St Giles</ORGANIZATION>. Adding to the
jumble were old geometric models made of plaster, metal and wire which had
been retrieved from some forgotten basement. A box of empty coffee jars and
a broken percolator lay on the floor, next to a jigsaw puzzle of special
difficulty based on one of <LOCATION>Penrose</LOCATION>'s own geometric brainteasers. Symbols and
equations ran riot on the blackboard behind his desk.
Mathematics must be wired into the <PERSON>Penrose</PERSON> family. An older brother, <PERSON>Oliver</PERSON>,
has just retired as professor of mathematics at <ORGANIZATION>Heriot-Watt University</ORGANIZATION>,
<LOCATION>Edinburgh</LOCATION>. A younger brother, <PERSON>Jonathan</PERSON>, is a chess grandmaster. A nephew
teaches maths at <LOCATION>Durham</LOCATION> and a son is doing his post-doctorate in the
subject.
Penrose, whose special ability is spatial thinking, began constructing
polyhedra (many-sided shapes) at the age of 10, when he regarded maths as a
kind of game. 'An ability to do maths is not essentially different from
ordinary thinking,' he said. 'One does it for fun, really. So you have to
enjoy it to do it seriously.'
Mathematics was discussed round the family dinner table. Penrose's father, a
specialist in the inheritance of mental defects, would speculate on whether
the brain was some sort of computer. However, he expected his son to become
a doctor. 'I was actually, secretly, going to be a brain surgeon,' <PERSON>Penrose</PERSON>
said.
Another influence was a series of radio broadcasts by Professor <PERSON>Fred Hoyle</PERSON>
(leading proponent of the 'steady state' theory of the universe). Lunching
with his elder brother at <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION> one day, <PERSON>Penrose</PERSON> impressed <PERSON>Denis Sciama</PERSON>,
a cosmologist, by questioning <PERSON>Hoyle</PERSON>'s description of galaxies disappearing
over the horizon of the universe.
'I drew a picture to show it didn't make sense. I think <PERSON>Denis</PERSON> was quite
struck by this and later when I went to <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION> as a graduate student he
took me under his wing.'
As a student at <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Penrose</PERSON> took up, as sidelines, quantum
theory, particle physics, general relativity and cosmology.
He also studied mathematical logic, where he encountered <PERSON>Kurt Godel</PERSON>'s
revolutionary proof that in any logical system, such as that on which
arithmetic is based, there are truths which cannot be derived from the
axioms of the system. An interpretation of <ORGANIZATION>Godel</ORGANIZATION>'s 'incompleteness' theorem
underpins the controversial claims of Shadows.
Penrose wrote these two 'popular' science books partly to convey his own
sense of excitement, he says. To call them popular is misleading, however.
Most of his supporting evidence is indecipherable to non-mathematicians.
Even if the hypothesis is clear, the books are tougher to read than the
best-selling <ORGANIZATION>Brief History of Time</ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON>Stephen Hawking</PERSON>, <PERSON>Penrose</PERSON>'s opposite
number at <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION> and former collaborator on <ORGANIZATION>Black Holes</ORGANIZATION>.
The books were to have been a retirement project. Then <PERSON>Penrose</PERSON> saw a re-run
of a TV programme in which <PERSON>Marvin Minsky</PERSON> and another American pioneer of the
'hard' school of artificial intelligence made 'some very extreme remarks'.
He added: 'From their very particular point of view what they said was
logical. But I just don't believe it. As an undergraduate I had tried to
build up logical systems which would reduce thinking to computation. Even
then, in the middle of doing it, I had a suspicion that something was wrong
and this wouldn't work.'
Most people, I said, had never heard of <LOCATION>Godel</LOCATION> but would say it was obvious
that consciousness wasn't just computation. Why did you need to demonstrate
it?
'It's very curious. You find people on both sides who regard the other point
of view as ridiculous. People say 'Why bother to write the book?' But what's
not so obvious is that I am saying something stronger: that is, that you
can't even simulate this activity.
'There is a view that a machine can act as though it sees red, feels pain,
etc. My line is different. I'm saying it can't even act as though it has
these qualities. There is something in our understanding which you couldn't
even imitate . . . and, stronger still, you couldn't do it with presently
known physics.
'The argument from obviousness is a good argument, but it doesn't get you
anywhere. It doesn't tell you what to do.' Briefly, what <ORGANIZATION>Penrose</ORGANIZATION> tells us to
do is look at the 'microtubules' in the neurons, or brain cells, for signs
of quantum brain activity which could, with the missing physics, translate
into non-computable consciousness.
Are you envious of the computer's power?
'People often ask me that one,' <PERSON>Penrose</PERSON> replied. 'There is certainly an
element of pride, I suppose, and not wanting to be outdone by a mere machine
and that sort of thing. If computers get very good at chess I don't like the
idea. But I'm pretty sure it's more than that. I don't think it's correct,
that's all.'
Do mathematicians like you feel left out of the argument?
'Certainly I feel there's an awful lot of very hard work, clever work, very
important work which is almost totally ignored and dismissed, simply because
it's not something that people understand and may not have any immediate
value. Mathematicians tend to be modest. They work away in their corners and
don't go and shout about things.'
So you think computer science is hijacking maths?
'I think to some extent it has hijacked it. There's some interesting stuff,
of course, and I don't want to denigrate it. But I don't think it should
take over in the public's mind.'
The pure mathematician is, of course, a species of philosopher. Whether
<PERSON>Penrose</PERSON>'s mathematical brilliance carries over to his philosophical
reasoning is what his critics question.
But in subscribing to a Platonic world of ideas, he is certainly not alone,
even among mathematicians. The concepts, he says, are 'out there' in the
sense of being independent of our perception of them. Does he mean that they
exist like Plato's forms?
'Yes, very much so. But I get into a lot of trouble on that one. People will
often go along with other things I say. But even the most sympathetic I find
sometimes baulk at taking mathematical forms as really existing.
'The trouble is, if you don't take them as existing in some sense then the
other mysteries become even more mysterious. The physical world behaves to
such an extraordinary degree in accordance with highly sophisticated
mathematics. It makes that mystery even more puzzling if the mathematics
somehow isn't there, if it's our creation.
'<ORGANIZATION>Einstein</ORGANIZATION>'s theory of general relativity is a wonderful example why that
can't be the case. Newton's theory of gravity had been around for years and
<PERSON>Einstein</PERSON> didn't need to produce a new theory for which there was anyway not
much evidence at the time.
'But now it's become the most accurate theory known to science. And it was
there all the time] It's not that somehow we've imposed our thinking on the
way that space is constructed. It's out there.'
Then why don't you just say that souls exist, too, and do our thinking?
'Well, I suppose one can say things like that. Certainly if one uses 'soul'
to describe a person's consciousness I have no objection to that. It's just
a word I tend not to like to use because it has unfortunate connotations. I
suppose I don't find it very helpful.'
Are you really a Pythagorean mystic?
'Sometimes people call me that. Labels are things which people put on me.
Pythagorean mystic? I hate to use the word mystic. But I certainly have been
called Pythagorean rather than Platonic as someone who believes in
mathematics underlying everything.'
I asked <PERSON>Penrose</PERSON> whether the controversy excited by his books was drawing him
away from his chief activity, which is mathematical physics  - specifically,
something called twistor theory which he has worked on for 30 years.
'I have other things I really want to get back to,' he said, 'although the
question of the missing physics is something I want to think about more
seriously. In a certain sense I regard all these other things as
distractions from my work. But they're interesting distractions.'

FT  26 JUL 93 / Survey of Cardiff Bay and the Barrage (7): Catching the
world's eye - Marketing: A campaign that may run for 20 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKETING of the <LOCATION>Cardiff Bay</LOCATION> development project is not simply about
letting people know that it exists. It is also about trying to form
connections with potential investors from across the world and about
informing them precisely what the development has to offer.
<PERSON>Michael Boyce</PERSON>, chief executive of the <ORGANIZATION>Cardiff Bay Development Corporation</ORGANIZATION>
(CBDC), is reluctant to discuss precisely how much has been spent on
marketing the project, but the corporation's former advertising agency,
<PERSON>Travis Dale</PERSON>, says that the account was worth Pounds 500,000 in <DATE>1992</DATE>.
Once parliamentary approval has been obtained, the project will shift gear
and the marketing effort will increase substantially. A gala occasion at the
<ORGANIZATION>Mermaid Theatre</ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, on <DATE>May 18</DATE> - originally planned to co-incide with
the much-delayed securing of Parliamentary approval - is reputed to have
cost Pounds 200,000, and was designed to support the second stage message
that <LOCATION>Cardiff Bay</LOCATION> is now 'open for business'.
Held in the presence of <LOCATION>Princess Diana</LOCATION>, the event featured music from <LOCATION>Verdi</LOCATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Bizet</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Gershwin</ORGANIZATION>, sung by stars from <ORGANIZATION>Welsh National Opera</ORGANIZATION>, and a new
orchestral piece, the <ORGANIZATION>Cardiff Bay Overture</ORGANIZATION>, specially commissioned from
<LOCATION>Welsh</LOCATION> composer <PERSON>Gareth Wood</PERSON> - set against an audio-visual backdrop of <ORGANIZATION>Cardiff</ORGANIZATION>
and the bay area.
The hard sell came in the form of speeches from <PERSON>Michael Boyce</PERSON> himself, Sir
<PERSON>Geoffrey Inkin</PERSON>, chairman of the CBDC, and the then <ORGANIZATION>Welsh Secretary</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>David
Hunt</PERSON>; the soft sell in the form of on-screen messages from former prime
minister, <PERSON>Lord Callaghan</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Cardiff</LOCATION>, who represented the area now covered by
the scheme in the <ORGANIZATION>House of Commons</ORGANIZATION> for more than 40 years, and Oscar-winning
Welsh actor, Sir <PERSON>Anthony Hopkins</PERSON> who trained in the city.
The Mermaid Theatre gala was not, however, just a cultural event, addressing
itself to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s political and opinion-forming classes - and, it has to be
said, to a good number of visitors from the <LOCATION>Principality</LOCATION> itself.
<ORGANIZATION>Cardiff Bay</ORGANIZATION>'s marketing people, <ORGANIZATION>Edelman PR Worldwide</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Quadrant
Public Relations</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Cardiff</LOCATION>, had made sure that representatives from 14
countries in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>north America</LOCATION> and the Far East not only attended but
were given a precisely documented list of business possibilities which the
bay can offer.
<PERSON>Duncan Syme</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Cardiff Bay</ORGANIZATION>'s commercial and marketing director says: 'We can't
sell <ORGANIZATION>Cardiff Bay</ORGANIZATION> in isolation. We have had to try to lift the awareness of
<ORGANIZATION>Cardiff</ORGANIZATION> in the property and business world generally. The first three years
of our marketing activity have sought to generate that awareness, promoting
the big idea of the transformation of dereliction into a range of
development sites. We are now moving into more specific marketing campaigns
to get inward investment but it is a campaign which will run over 15 to 20
years.'
<PERSON>Peter Miller</PERSON>, of the consultancy, <ORGANIZATION>Business Development Group</ORGANIZATION>, which has been
responsible for the marketing strategy for the project, says that the
problem has always been how to market something that has not previously
existed.
'The <ORGANIZATION>Cardiff Bay Development Corporation</ORGANIZATION> has a much broader remit than
simple property development. In the UK the majority of development projects
are about refurbishment but <LOCATION>Cardiff Bay</LOCATION> is not about rescuing derelict
buildings. It is about the re-orientation of a city, bringing <ORGANIZATION>Cardiff</ORGANIZATION> into
the first division of international cities. The city, which currently faces
inward, will be turned around so that it has a waterfront.'
The initial phase of the marketing campaign has been constrained in two
ways, says <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>. 'The essential infrastructure work has had to be done
first. There has been a very lengthy period of land acquisition, and public
consultation. The other constraint has been that the scheme involved the
building of a barrage, which in turn needed a parliamentary bill. That also
has taken time. While those two constraints were with us, the marketing was
stuck in a warm-up phase. We now feel we are at a watershed, ready to move
into a new phase. We have moved from an awareness campaign to one which says
we are now open for business.'
The corporation ran an 18-month advertising campaign from <DATE>1991</DATE>, and another
has just started, using a set of 'visionaries from the past' (such as
Pythagoras) to comment on the project. These ads will run in the press,
particularly business publications. 'As the campaign evolves you will see
more closely-targeted advertising, aimed at the industrial, property,
leisure and tourism markets,' says <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Michael Boyce</PERSON> says that one of the most important aspects of the project is
its international marketing, which will attempt to make the world understand
that the project matches any other of the same kind. 'We are re-developing a
sixth of the city, and we will never know when it is finished. It will be a
continuing process, but there will be milestones along the way.'
To draw that international attention, <PERSON>Boyce</PERSON> is looking ahead over the next
three years. 'We have had a link, for almost a decade now, with the
metropolitan area of <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> - on the east coast of the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> - which was the
inspiration and model for <ORGANIZATION>Cardiff Bay</ORGANIZATION>. The local county councils,
universities, and chambers of commerce, on both sides of the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> have
built links to help each other's developments, not least by pointing
business people in each other's directions. That is much more effective, we
think, than trying to target the whole of <LOCATION>north America</LOCATION>, where we have no
chance at all of making an impact.'
Boyce is planning to develop the same kind of links with <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> -
in <LOCATION>New South Wales</LOCATION>, named by its discoverers after the old south <LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION>
because of the similarity in shape fo the coastline. '<ORGANIZATION>Cardiff</ORGANIZATION>, with the bay
development, will be part of a newer <LOCATION>South Wales</LOCATION>, so there is an immediate
historical and emotional link. We will be trying to persuade the
Australians, who might normally think of investing in the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> region, to
consider <ORGANIZATION>Cardiff Bay</ORGANIZATION>.'
<LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> also has longstanding maritime links with <ORGANIZATION>Cardiff</ORGANIZATION>, evident in the
newly-retored Norwegian church recently moved to a new site in the docks
area. <PERSON>Roald Dahl</PERSON>, the author, was brought up in the city, his Norwegian
father having established a ship-broking business there, while another
brother went to <ORGANIZATION>La Rochelle</ORGANIZATION>. As a result, <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> too is on <ORGANIZATION>Boyce</ORGANIZATION>'s list.
'Like the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION>, what a nonsense it would be if we sought to
market ourselves to the whole of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. In each of the areas we select, we
will, of course, target particularly relevant industries. That is our thrust
for the next three years.'

Despite centuries of effort, mathematicians have been unable to prove that the
most efficient way to arrange spherical objects is to stagger the layers so
that each object sits in the depression formed by those below. UC Berkeley's
We-Yi Hsiang has shown the validity in a 150-page proof of fJohannes Kepler's
1611 postulate.; To position round objects most efficiently on a flat surfact,
they should be arranged so that each touches six others as in this view from
above.; Greengrocers know that to stack oranges most efficiently, each one
should be placed in the depression formed by the oranges below it.  </CAPTION>

<LEADPARA>  A mathematician from the University of California, Berkeley, says he has
proved a theorem that has mystified scientists for 380 years.;    The theorem,
put forth by astronomer Johannes Kepler in 1611, involves the most efficient
way to pack round objects in a square box.  </LEADPARA>

MATHEMATICIAN OFFERS PROOF OF AN OLD IDEA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Greengrocers have known intuitively for hundreds of years that the best way
to pack oranges, for example, is to stagger the layers so that each orange
sits in the depression formed by three oranges below it. Kepler theorized that
a denser arrangement is not possible, but mathematicians have never been able
to prove it despite nearly four centuries of strenuous effort.;    In 15
months of work that has resulted in a 150-page printed proof, <PERSON>Wu-Yi Hsiang</PERSON> has
been able to show that <PERSON>Kepler</PERSON> and the greengrocers were right.;    The proof,
however, has implications far beyond packing: The theorem governs a broad
spectrum of the behavior of matter, ranging from why snowflakes have hexagonal
shapes to how metal and other crystals are formed.;     If the proof, now
circulating among other mathematicians, survives scrutiny, "Hsiang will have
achieved one of the most astonishing successes in the entire history of
mathematics," mathematician <PERSON>Ian Stewart</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Warwick said.;   
Hsiang</ORGANIZATION>, who has been on the campus for 23 years, is a well-respected
topologist, a researcher who studies the mathematics of surfaces. He became
interested in the Kepler problem, he said, when he volunteered to teach an
undergraduate course on classical geometry.;    <PERSON>Kepler</PERSON>, who achieved his fame
for formulating the laws of planetary motion, discovered the problem when he
began thinking about the exquisite six-sided symmetry of snowflakes. In a
pamphlet that was a New Year's present to his sponsor, <PERSON>John Wacker</PERSON>, he reached
the heart of the problem: Is symmetry imposed on snowflakes by something
outside them or is it inherent in the nature of the water molecules from which
it is formed?;    Assuming it was the latter, he began considering the way
that spheres (most simple molecules are roughly spherical) can pack together.;
   Two ways to layer;  To begin with, there are two ways to arrange a layer of
spheres in two dimensions -- such as on a tabletop. In the first, the spheres
are aligned in perpendicular rows so that each sphere touches four neighbors.
In the second, the rows are staggered so that each sphere touches six
neighbors -- which are at the corners of a hexagon. Kepler predicted that the
second arrangement provided the densest possible packing, but even that
seemingly simple idea was not proved mathematically until <DATE>1892</DATE>, 281 years
after <PERSON>Kepler</PERSON> formulated it.;    The problem becomes more difficult when
extended to three dimensions, as when an orange crate is packed. There are
then two ways to add more layers to the first. In one, each new sphere is
placed directly above a sphere in the bottom layer. In the other, each new
sphere is placed in the depression between three spheres in the lower layer.; 
  Kepler calculated that in the first arrangement, only a little more than <PERCENT>60
percent</PERCENT> of a box is filled with fruit. The second arrangement, widely used for
packing fruit and other round objects, is visibly denser -- <PERCENT>74.04 percent</PERCENT> of
the space is filled with fruit, <PERSON>Kepler found.</PERSON>;    The question then becomes to
prove mathematically that this is the maximum possible density. Is there any
other arrangement of the spheres that increases their density? <PERSON>Kepler</PERSON> said no,
but was unable to prove it. Neither had anyone else until now.;    The problem
that blocked previous proofs, <PERSON>Hsiang</PERSON> said, is that the entire field of
spherical geometry was poorly developed. "Essentially, I had to develop
spherical geometry to the level needed to solve the problem," he said. That
meant developing many new spherical geometry theorems to provide the
intellectual framework necessary to produce the ultimate proof.;    "That's
why the proof is so long," he noted.;    The proof is also unusual in that, at
a time when computers are playing an increasingly important role in
mathematics, <PERSON>Hsiang</PERSON> worked largely without one. "There are still a lot of
mathematical problems that need ideas that don't come from a computer," said
UC-Berkeley mathematician <PERSON>Shiing-Shen Chern</PERSON>. "Computers are very fast, but the
basic ideas must come from humans.";    'Happy enough';  Is Hsiang's proof
correct? No one yet knows for sure, wrote <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> in a recent issue of New
Scientist magazine, but "The mathematical community seems happy enough to
accept that it probably is.";    And what does the theorem have to do with
snowflakes? Kepler intuited that when large numbers of tiny particles, such as
water molecules or metal atoms, aggregate, they automatically create geometric
regularity. The water molecules that form the core of a snowflake adopt the
same form of dense hexagonal packing used by greengrocers. As the snowflake
grows, the symmetry is retained.;    Now, <PERSON>Hsiang</PERSON> has apparently brought the
problem full circle by providing the first mathematical proof of Kepler's
idea. In the process, he has shown geometricians that there is a lot that they
did not know about spheres.  </TEXT>

   A mathematical puzzle that has
fascinated scientists and researchers for hundreds of years may now
be solved, a professor at <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Max-Planck Institute</ORGANIZATION> said
<DATE>today</DATE>.
   The puzzle has been how to prove <ORGANIZATION>Fermat</ORGANIZATION>'s Last Theorem,
developed by French mathematician <PERSON>Pierre de Fermat</PERSON>, who lived from
<DATE>1601</DATE> to <DATE>1665</DATE>.
   The theorem states: X to the Nth power, plus Y to the Nth power,
equals Z to the Nth power, where X, Y, and Z are nonzero integers,
has no solutions for N when N is an integer _ or whole number _
greater than the number two.
   Fermat, who was also a magistrate, developed his expertise in
mathematics as a hobby, and was one of the founders of modern
Number Theory and Probability.
   ``Many important developments in number theory have resulted
from unsuccessful attempts to prove Fermat's Last Theorem,''
Professor <PERSON>Don Zagier</PERSON> said in a telephone interview.
   Now, Japanese mathematician <PERSON>Yoichi Miyaoka</PERSON>, who also works at
the <ORGANIZATION>Max-Planck Institute for Mathematics</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION>, may have finally
proven Fermat's Last Theorem, <PERSON>Zagier</PERSON> said.
   ``This whole thing is of course in the preliminary stages, but
<LOCATION>Miyaoka</LOCATION>, who gave a presentation on his solution 10 days ago,
believes he has proven the theory and it is certainly serious and
very exciting,'' <PERSON>Zagier</PERSON> said.
   Zagier, an American working as a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION>Max-Planck
Institute</ORGANIZATION>, is also a professor at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Maryland</ORGANIZATION>.
   He said he jotted down notes at <LOCATION>Miyaoka</LOCATION>'s presentation and sent
them to several experts, including <PERSON>Gerd Faltings</PERSON> at <LOCATION>Princeton</LOCATION> and
mathemeticians <PERSON>Barry Mazur</PERSON> and <PERSON>Christophe Soule</PERSON>' in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>.
   ``Of course the notes alone are not sufficient, and <PERSON>Miyaoka</PERSON> has
been preparing and checking his manuscript on the solution for the
past week, and that will also be sent to the experts to check,''
said <PERSON>Zagier</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Zagier</PERSON> said he hoped some results from the experts would be
forthcoming ``within 10 days, but it could also take several
months.''
   Asked if <LOCATION>Miyaoka</LOCATION> was available to discuss his solution of
proving Fermat's Last Theorem, <PERSON>Zagier</PERSON> said the Japanese was ``too
busy rechecking his work, because there is always a chance of an
error, and he wants to be sure the manuscript is accurate before it
goes out.''
   ``I've been more or less answering the telephone for him since
word of this leaked out,'' <PERSON>Zagier</PERSON> said.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Private View: Bringing the cosmos down to earth -
Cosmologist John Barrow discusses life, the universe and the possible
existence of a Theory of Everything
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAN THE Secret of the Universe be written on the front of a T-shirt?
Religious belief is in secular decline in the West, its explanations
seemingly exhausted. Now science, having murdered Faith, is accused of
failing us in its turn. The bookshops are bursting with competing answers:
on one rack religion, psychology and philosophy; on another astrology,
mythology and the occult; on a third, particle physics, the human gene,
consciousness, the universe, Everything. We are still desperately looking
for that whatever-it-is.
One of the best guides to the cosmic tour is <PERSON>John Barrow</PERSON>, author of the
T-shirt question. He is a 39-year-old cosmologist, professor of astronomy at
the <ORGANIZATION>University of Sussex</ORGANIZATION>, who studies the birth of the universe and the
formation of the galaxies. His popular books revolve around questions of the
ultimate. Is there a Theory of Everything, a TOE? Or is the grand unified
theory, so spectacularly marketed by <PERSON>Stephen Hawking</PERSON>, just wishful thinking?
Barrow may not have spectacular answers and his gifts as a scientist I
cannot judge. But as a populariser he is uncommonly successful: eclectic,
fluent, graphic and clear. His latest contribution, Pi in the Sky, discusses
whether mathematics (the form in which the <ORGANIZATION>TOE</ORGANIZATION> would be revealed) is in some
sense real, or whether it is just an uncannily successful device for
explaining the world to ourselves. The journey is as interesting as the
destination, as <LOCATION>Barrow</LOCATION> explains why words for 'one' and 'two' so often have
different roots from words for 'first' and 'second', or why ancient
shepherds could not count sheep.
Why should Barrow bother to tell us all this?
'It isn't to spread my name,' he said. 'It's important to get scientific
ideas across. I felt other people wouldn't write the books I wanted to read
 -so I had to write them myself.'
Scientists, he added, were writing their own popularisations these days to
explain their ideas to each other as much as to the public. 'So the public
are participating in a live dialogue, not just being sold a story.'
Is it also because science has become too difficult for non-scientists to
explain?
'In the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION> popularisation has meant producing little pictures of what things
are like - for instance, how quarks are confined in nuclei like balls in a
rubber bag. It has come to mean producing analogies. At the turn of the
century continentals such as Poincare criticised us for that. But if you
look at what real scientists are doing you have to say that what they are
producing is analogies - if rather more complex, abstract and high-powered.
You might see mathematics as an analogy - or you might regard it as the real
thing.'
Is physics at a watershed? Is that why there is this desire to produce
ordinary-language explanations?
'For some reason there is enormous public interest. It is almost like a
substitute religion. The traditional view is that people like to have some
transcendent reality, just like they have to have a sense of community in
society. Perhaps this hankering after ideas of ultimate truth fits into that
category.
'But it can't be the whole story because people with conventional beliefs
are interested in these developments in science. One blatantly chauvinistic
attitude would be to say these things just are more interesting than
anything else on offer.'
Barrow is persuasive on a platform but in private is cautious, even
monotonous. He is agile physically as he is mentally; he was an 800 metres
runner, a former junior national indoor champion who once beat <PERSON>Steve Ovett</PERSON>.
It was through athletics that he acquired his unusual fluency and wide
knowledge. His seven A levels included classical Greek, religious studies
and English, which he read for at home with his philosophy-trained running
coach, <PERSON>John Turp</PERSON>, in exchange for instructing Turp in maths and physics.
'So I got used at a very early age to explaining things orally and learning
things by explaining them.'
There was no science in the family: his father worked for a subsidiary of
<PERSON>Joe Lyons</PERSON>, the catering chain.
Why did he choose cosmology?
'I can remember from the age of 16 or so wanting to do astrophysics. I was
not one of these people who wanted to look through telescopes. What
interested me was this issue of mathematics. I remember asking at school:
Why is that when we heat this thing up it does what the maths says it will
do? How does it know? The prospect of being able to understand a star
millions of light years away just by using simple laws of heat and gravity
all seemed very neat.'
When I asked him about those who accuse science of barren ambition, he
replied that specialisation was inevitable: western science had been so
fertile precisely because a monotheistic religion had prompted the search
for natural laws handed down by a divine lawgiver. Oriental science had been
retarded by the application of etiquette and harmony to nature.
Like <PERSON>Stephen Hawking</PERSON> before him, <PERSON>Barrow</PERSON> was summoned to <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> to debate
cosmology with <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> theologians. God and science are not in opposition,
he said. 'You can think of God as a mathematician or computer programmer, if
you like, as lighting the blue touchpaper and retiring. Theologians prefer
to think of God as sustaining the world from moment to moment.'
It was biologists, not cosmologists, who were most hostile to religion
because of the Darwinians' struggle against the church in the <DATE>last century</DATE>.
'Cosmologists, I think, appreciate the uncertainty of their subject. They
are less confident and strident than biologists, with good reason. They have
less data. If you look at their personal views, you will find many more
cosmologists with strong religious beliefs than you would ever find
biologists.'
Are you interested in revealed religion?
'In my Theories of Everything I made the connection with mythological
accounts of the world. These in a sense were the first theories of
everything. They tried to include everything, leave nothing unknown or
inexplicable because it was too frightening. They made huge tapestries into
which to interweave more and more facts.'
Do you believe in resurrection and redemption?
Barrow was evasive. 'There may be a religious perspective that you won't
find in a test tube or in an equation: I'm a strong believer that there are
complementary ways of looking at the world.
'The scientific approach is different. Take a neon sign, for example. You
could explain it in terms of quantum electronics with 100 per cent
completeness but you wouldn't want to write down what the sign was actually
saying as part of that description. To say that the sign said '<ORGANIZATION>Coca Cola</ORGANIZATION>'
wouldn't be part of the scientific account.'
I asked him to define the limits of science. Are you running out of
analogies? Is the world untranslateable now in a way that the Newtonian
world of billiard balls was not?
Barrow came back to his conundrum about the reality of mathematics. 'Is the
world really mathematical or is maths just a way of describing the world?
This is the crux of the question.
'Take a computer programme that simulates how galaxies form: load it up with
laws of gravity, run it to simulate billions of years, watch the clusters
occur. Continuing into the far future you would see stars and planets form;
you might see living beings evolve in the computer program which could
transmit messages to each other. Practically speaking, they would be
conscious but they would have no material existence. What are they? They
exist in the programming, in the mathematics. A Platonist would say they
exist in every possible sense of the word.
'There is this extraordinary power of mathematics. It doesn't almost work,
it works precisely and wonderfully and it works best in those areas such as
elementary particle physics that are farthest removed from our everyday
experience. So to say we just developed this capacity sounds wrong. Where
there is no evolutionary advantage, maths works most persuasively.'
Do cosmologists feel they are reaching the limits of what they can assert
and convey?
'They certainly might be reaching the end of the observational and
experimental road. There are two big constraints here. The first is: suppose
a Theory of Everything exists in some form, why should we be able to
understand and unravel it, living in <DATE>1992</DATE> on a planet in the suburbs of the
Milky Way? It's an extraordinary anti-Copernican presumption that we should
be clever enough to understand this after just a few hundred years of
thinking about it.
'The other telling point is that what we can know is conditioned by the
evolutionary process, by the necessities of surviving in our environment. As
far as we can judge there is no reason why understanding a Theory of
Everything is necessary for our survival.'
Does it matter if there is a TOE or not? Are you able to say if there is
one?
'I'm obviously not in a position to say, but I can speculate. If you look at
what scientists do there is almost a presumption that there is. It's grown
out of the idea that there is a single lawgiver and a set of laws. What's
the alternative, a series of cosmic <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> walls?'
Would the TOE be boring?
'Well, it could turn out to be a necessary truth. There could be one and
only one possible mathematical theory in which every piece of the jigsaw
puzzle will fit. That's what people hope. The alternative, which to me seems
more likely, is that the theory would allow many different types of
universe, of which ours is one example. Just as the laws of nature allow
many outcomes in which the symmetries of the laws are broken and disguised,
the universe itself may be one of these disguised outcomes.'
Would it be a testable, useful theory.?
'It might be. But suppose there was a theory and we could find it by some
flash of insight, why should we be able to test it or check it? This is a
much more significant point. The problem is that theory races way ahead of
experiment. We don't have the financial means, the practical means, to test
theories about the beginning of the universe. Why should the universe be so
constructed that we should be able to test these theories?' So we could end
up with several consistent theories and no way of distinguishing which was
the right one?
'That's right.'
In The Hitchhiker's Guide to the <PERSON>Galaxy Douglas Adams</PERSON> makes the computer,
Deep Thought, cough up the answer to the riddle of the universe. It is 42.
Deep Thought cannot, of course, supply the question. So, the day we learn
there really is a TOE, I doubt I shall feel too excited. I shall wait for
<PERSON>John Barrow</PERSON>'s book.

<TEXT>
   As thousands of American teen-agers
struggle with the complexities of basic algebra, a 17-year-old
English girl is being wooed by <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> and several other
universities to lecture and continue her mathematical research on
such subjects as quantum groups and statistical mechanics.
   <PERSON>Ruth J. Lawrence</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Oxford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, is manipulating some of the
most complex concepts in mathematics. Her work has taken her to the
outer fringes of theoretical physics and mathematics, such subjects
as knot and string theory, and the connections between the world of
particle physics and mathematics.
   She entered <ORGANIZATION>Oxford University</ORGANIZATION> six years ago and by age 13 had her
degree. Today she is working on her doctorate and has long since
caught the attention of the world's top mathematicians.
   Lawrence has already taught students at <ORGANIZATION>Oxford</ORGANIZATION> on a tutorial
basis. If she accepts a position at an American university it will
be mainly to conduct research. But she said she might lead a seminar
or deliver an occasional lecture. In addition to <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> and
<LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Princeton's Institute for Advance Study</ORGANIZATION> is interested in
bringing Lawrence in for a year.
   It all began not in some exclusive British school but in
<LOCATION>Lawrence</LOCATION>'s own home in <LOCATION>Oxford</LOCATION>, where her father, <PERSON>Harry</PERSON>, a computer
consultant, gave <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> her entire pre-Oxford education.
   ``I was always dealing with adults so when I got to Oxford I
fitted into the atmosphere. ... He didn't use any textbooks. He
taught me totally himself,'' she said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> while visiting
Harvard with her father.
   Lawrence got top scores on her Oxford entrance exam. It was at
that point, her father said, ``it was obvious to me that she was a
little better than most.''
   Once at <ORGANIZATION>Oxford, Lawrence</ORGANIZATION> studied under Sir <PERSON>Michael Atiyah</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Royal
Society Research</ORGANIZATION> Professor at <ORGANIZATION>Oxford</ORGANIZATION> and ``one of the great
mathematicians of the world,'' according to <PERSON>John Addison</PERSON>, chairman
of the mathematics department at the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION> at
<LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>, one of the schools recruiting Lawrence.
   Lawrence seems to have taken her rapid rise in stride. She is
much more interested in talking about the vast unknown in the world
of mathematics than dwelling on her accomplishments.
   ``When I was taught mathematics in the beginning I was interested
in it. I just liked it. I didn't think it was anything special,''
<PERSON>Lawrence</PERSON> said.
   Now, <PERSON>Lawrence</PERSON> says, ``The age thing really does not matter for
more than the first two seconds. ... I talk to mathematicians as
mathematicians and I think they talk to me in the same way.''
   Addison, <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>'s math chairman, has been tracking <PERSON>Lawrence</PERSON>'s
career for the past seven years. ``Word was certainly getting around
in the mathematical field that there was this very unusual
prodigy,'' <PERSON>Addison</PERSON> said.
   Lawrence just spent four weeks in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> attending a
prestigious mathematics conference at the <ORGANIZATION>Mathematical Science
Research Institute</ORGANIZATION>, also in <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>. The discussion among
scientists and mathematicians from around the world focused on the
relationship between physics and mathematics, <PERSON>Lawrence</PERSON>'s area of
concentration.
   Addison interviewed <PERSON>Lawrence</PERSON> for a possible research position at
<LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> and found her ``a very nice person. Sometimes prodigies end
up being kind of strange or egotistic. I didn't sense that.''
   <PERSON>Harry Lawrence</PERSON> said he taught his daughter at home so she could
reach her highest potential. He is using the same method in teaching
his other daughter, <PERSON>Rebecca</PERSON>, 15, who is something of a piano
prodigy, with one <ORGANIZATION>British Broadcasting Corp.</ORGANIZATION> concert under her belt.
   To the inevitable question of whether Ruth feels she has missed
out on childhood she answers unequivocally: ``I've had a very
enjoyable childhood. I've had so many opportunities I wouldn't have
had if I'd gone the ordinary route.''

<MONEY>$795</MONEY> for an enhanced version that uses the built-in co-processor of Mac II
systems. For 386-based MS-DOS computers, the regular and enhanced versions are
<MONEY>$695</MONEY> and <MONEY>$995</MONEY>, respectively.;    <ORGANIZATION>Mathematica</ORGANIZATION> is sold by <ORGANIZATION>Wolfram Research Inc.</ORGANIZATION>
of <LOCATION>Champaign</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, (217) 398-0700.;    For those who might not need all the
supercomputer graphics power of <LOCATION>Mathematica</LOCATION> but who still need a computational
engine that is robust and flexible enough to serve both the rocket scientist
and the high school student, there is MathCAD (<MONEY>$495</MONEY> for either the Macintosh
or personal computer versions, from <ORGANIZATION>Mathsoft Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, (800)
628-4223.;    <ORGANIZATION>Mathsoft</ORGANIZATION>, which gives "very aggressive educational discounts," a
spokesman said, is working on a new personal computer version for release in
the spring.;    By the time students are ready to use Mathematica or MathCAD,
they probably have a firm grasp of basic math principles.;    For younger
students who need a grounding in the basics, there are many good programs
available.;    The New Math Blaster Plus, for <ORGANIZATION>DOS</ORGANIZATION> computers, updates one of
the most popular math programs for students in grades 1 to 6 (ages 6 to 12).; 
  The "new" apparently refers to the inclusion of VGA-level graphics and new
sound effects, as well as a new problem-solving game.;    A sticker on the box
refers to "state-of-the-art" graphics, animation and sounds, which is an
exaggeration. The <ORGANIZATION>VGA</ORGANIZATION> graphics and sound effects are not bad, but they are
nothing extraordinary.;    The program consists of four activities, each of
which covers addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, decimals,
fractions and percents.;    The parent or teacher (or child, for that matter)
may choose the level of difficulty on a scale that corresponds to grade
level.;    The New Math Blaster Plus uses an outer space theme -- the good
guys are Blasternaut and his sidekick Spot (it would be nicer if the main
character were gender-neutral), and the bad guys are the "Evil Trash Aliens"
who litter the galaxy with debris.;    The conservation theme is carried to
some of the other activities. By answering questions correctly in one of the
four activities, for example, the player "recycles" numbers.;    Teachers or
parents may print certificates of achievement and "report cards" for players
who do well. In a test run using an ink-jet printer, the fancier certificates
would not come out because the software does not yet support that type of
printer, but a rather drab, plain-text certificate came out fine.;   
Equations also may be printed in test form, and teachers may add their own
questions to the mix to make customized tests.;    The New Math Blaster Plus
costs <MONEY>$49.95</MONEY> for the DOS version and <MONEY>$59.95</MONEY> for the Macintosh version and is
available from <ORGANIZATION>Davidson &amp; Associates Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Torrance</LOCATION>, (800) 545-7677. As with
all <PERSON>Davidson</PERSON> titles, the program has a 30-day "satisfaction guarantee" that
allows for a full refund or exchange.;    Older students, from ages 10 to
adult, may wish to consider <ORGANIZATION>Math Blaster Mystery</ORGANIZATION>, which goes beyond Math
Blaster Plus to include word problems and pre-algebra.;    The Macintosh
version was tested on a Macintosh LC (<MONEY>$49.95</MONEY>), although MS-DOS and Apple II
versions also are available. Again, there are four activities.;    One of the
few mysteries in Math Blaster Mystery is why it is called "mystery" in the
first place. The activities are more along the lines of puzzles, such as math
versions of Hangman and the Towers of Hanoi.;    Along the way, the student
learns reasoning skills, negative numbers and factoring. Older students may
find the games boring after a while, but the software generally held the
interest of one pre-algebra lab assistant.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
<P>
FROM THE UPSTAIRS PORCH window of his split-level house in the <LOCATION>Puente Hills</LOCATION>, 
<PERSON>Bart Kosko</PERSON> enjoys a view of the largest Buddhist temple in the <LOCATION>Western 
Hemisphere</LOCATION>. Others can keep their manicured lawns, swimming pools, hot tubs, 
nearby golf courses and sundry suburban amenities. For <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON>, a 30-year-old 
assistant professor of electrical engineering at <LOCATION>USC</LOCATION>, it is enough to be able 
to gaze at one of the few buildings in the country where his concept of reality 
would not be denounced as scientific heresy, as well as an affront to common 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have a great belief in the truth of your own statements," says 
<PERSON>Kosko</PERSON>, whose mathematical ideas continue to encounter resistance and outrage 
from the scientific community in this country despite their widespread 
acceptance and application in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>. "You may have stumbled, humbly, upon a 
universal truth, but if the world, everyone from <LOCATION>Aristotle</LOCATION> to <PERSON>Bertrand Russell</PERSON>, 
says you're wrong, it takes immense ego not to agree with them." 
</P>
<P>
The universal truth to which he refers is called fuzziness. Developed by Polish 
mathematician <PERSON>Jan Lukasiewicz</PERSON> during the <DATE>1920s</DATE> and expanded (and named) 40 
years later by UC <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> computer scientist <PERSON>Lotfi A. Zadeh</PERSON>, fuzziness refutes 
the traditional Aristotelian theory of absolutes, arguing that the world is 
full of things that defy categorization by Western logic, things whose 
definitions are a little fuzzy. Its applications are, among other things, 
revolutionizing the computer world by creating systems of machine intelligence 
that compute in terms of humanlike reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kosko</PERSON>, a Zadeh protege, is the veritable <ORGANIZATION>St. Paul of Fuzziness</ORGANIZATION>. The American 
scientific community does not always take kindly to his devotions, however. 
Telling a modern scientist that there can be logic without Aristotelian tenets 
is like telling a Catholic there can be Christianity without Christ -- some 
scientists have apoplectic fits at the mention of <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON>'s name. Yet in this 
time of technological competition with the East, Japanese and Chinese 
scientists embrace fuzziness; with its acceptance of universal ambiguity, 
fuzziness is the mathematical equivalent of <LOCATION>Taoism</LOCATION> and Zen Buddhism. In <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, 
especially, <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON> is the <PERSON>Carl Sagan</PERSON> of fuzzy technology. Indeed, as many 
Western scientists begin rethinking <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON>, this mathematical doctrine may force 
the first actual confrontation, and eventually a melding, of <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> and 
Western philosophical and scientific ideology. 
</P>
<P>
Kosko is, in essence, the quintessential scientific cyberpunk -- a hip, 
street-smart prophet of life in the Information Age. He's also a musician, an 
essayist, a screenwriter -- and a pugnacious sort. He just may be able to pull 
it off. 
</P>
<P>
ZADEH EXPERIENCEDhis first flash of fuzzy revelation in a hotel bed; <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON> did 
his mentor one better -- he worked out key facets of the geometry of fuzziness 
while soaking in the hot tub behind his house. 
</P>
<P>
The hot tub is a fitting place for lambasting Aristotle. The baths were an 
ideal setting for ancient Greeks to debate the merits of the philosopher's 
world view. In his hot tub, <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON> contemplates his longstanding frustration 
with the way those theories continue to prejudice Western imagination. 
Aristotle, <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON> says, was just too rigid in his thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"Aristotle was never one to split hairs," he explains. "He believed you were 
either hairy or you weren't. If I were inclined to start plucking my own -- 
which I'm not -- I would eventually pull out the one hair that he would have 
argued separates hairy people from non-hairy people. Say that hair is number 
5,000. With it, I'm hairy. Without it, I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
In science, <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON> says, this absurd yet inviolable rule -- that everything must 
fit one category or another at all times -- is called the Law of the <ORGANIZATION>Excluded 
Middle</ORGANIZATION>. In it, there can be no shades of gray, no concepts such as "partly" or 
"mostly." 
</P>
<P>
"We've all been conditioned to behave as if this was true," <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON> says. "But it 
isn't -- not in the real world. These binary assumptions offer a handy first 
approximation of reality. But sooner or later they break down." 
</P>
<P>
Computers, symbols of pure logic, offer a good illustration of the difference 
between fuzzy and non-fuzzy thinking. Non-fuzzy computers, the technological 
epitome of Western thought, rely entirely on binary thinking. Everything they 
do is the result of combining ones and zeroes with and, or and not. The only 
thing programmed into the system is yes or no, categories of equality and 
inequality, and that's all that will come out. 
</P>
<P>
A traditional computer would have difficulties accommodating the concept of a 
platypus, for example, because it is an animal that is and is not, in equal 
measure, a mammal. Faced with this peculiar creature, the computer, like 
Western thought, is reduced to spinning its figurative gears. It simply cannot 
grapple with a world in which reality does not come prepackaged in crisp binary 
packages. 
</P>
<P>
Western scientists have tried to account for inherent ambiguities of the 
universe with probability theory -- the mathematical expression of the chance 
that a specific event will or will not occur. It usually takes the form of a 
number between one and zero. In the case of a set of tall people, for instance, 
individuals always would be categorized as tall or short. But a 5-foot-tall 
person might be described as having a <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> probability of belonging to the set, 
a 6-footer <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> and a 7-footer <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT>. In other words, probability reflects the 
statistical averages of the population -- <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> are below 5 feet, <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> are shorter 
than 6 feet and <PERCENT>99%</PERCENT> are shorter than 7. 
</P>
<P>
Probability works with large statistical populations, <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON> says, but is 
incapable of dealing with most individual situations. 
</P>
<P>
"It assumes the world is black or white," <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON> says, "but it's never sure 
which one. There's uncertainty in fuzziness, too, but it's deterministic 
uncertainty." 
</P>
<P>
Fuzziness, he says, measures the degree to which an event occurs. In other 
words, it models reality, basically providing a shortcut that probability 
cannot. A computer programmed with fuzzy chips can deal with degrees. It may, 
for instance, be drizzling slightly outside. A fuzzy computer chip will not try 
to categorize it as raining or not because it relies on a user-defined alphabet 
of functions rather than the usual ones and zeros. It can compute variations of 
measurement from light to heavy, small to large or slow to fast. 
</P>
<P>
An ordinary air conditioner, for instance, kicks in when it senses the 
environment is either too hot or too cold. It either will begin blasting at 
full power or shut down. But this isn't efficient or conducive to maintaining 
maximum levels of comfort. A fuzzy air conditioner, however, would be able to 
identify the more-comfortable temperature ranges. Instead of shutting down, the 
fuzzy air conditioner would taper off its activities as the area being cooled 
became more comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
So when a fuzzy computer is charged with control functions such as, say, 
docking a space shuttle with a space station, these translate into a smoothness 
of performance in control systems that cannot be replicated otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Although many of <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON>'s theories revolve around computer applications, he has 
dozens of everyday examples to explain the difference between fuzziness and 
probability: Whether or not an article is published, to use one of his 
favorites, is a matter of probability. The degree to which it is published -- 
it may or may not have been heavily edited -- is one of fuzziness. Or suppose, 
he says, there is a <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> chance that there is an apple in your refrigerator. 
That is probability. But what if there is half an apple in the refrigerator? 
That half an apple has a <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> degree of membership in the set of whole apples. 
Numerically, these two situations are equivalent. Physically, however, they are 
distinct. 
</P>
<P>
KOSKO HIMSELF embodies the fuzzy idea of many things concealed in one. A former 
farm boy who escaped the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> on a full music scholarship to <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1978</DATE>, 
<PERSON>Kosko</PERSON> straddles the disparate, and often antagonistic, cultures of science and 
art. As a neural networks expert and a fuzzy theorist, he has organized several 
important international conferences and is about to publish the first college 
textbook about neural networks -- computer systems that emulate an organism's 
ability to learn by experience. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> uses him as a consultant on the space 
shuttle, as did the <ORGANIZATION>Strategic Defense Initiative Office</ORGANIZATION>. Outside the realm of 
science, <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON> is an accomplished composer who scores his own videotaped 
lectures and a published writer and essayist. Currently, he is collaborating 
with <PERSON>Bill Gray</PERSON>, co-writer of "The <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> Experiment," on a 
science-fiction screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize that many people within academia frown upon my outside pursuits," 
<PERSON>Kosko</PERSON> says. "I suppose they view it as a dissipation of energy. I see it as a 
stimulant. I have a lot of energy." 
</P>
<P>
Kosko is a "bewildering combination of talents," says <PERSON>Marvin Minsky</PERSON>, an 
artificial intelligence pioneer at <ORGANIZATION>MIT</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>George Klir</PERSON>, editor of the prestigious 
International Journal of <ORGANIZATION>General Systems</ORGANIZATION> (soon to publish <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON>'s latest paper, 
which details the theorems proving fuzziness) calls <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON>'s mathematical ideas 
"quite profound." And <PERSON>Zadeh</PERSON>, his mentor, calls him "one of the most unusual and 
most highly gifted individuals I have ever met." 
</P>
<P>
Beneath it all lies obduracy that prevents <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON> from ever backing down from a 
fight. <PERSON>Bart Kosko</PERSON> is cocky and tenacious and driven by the belief that time is 
the enemy of all things. And to keep up with the exponential rate of change 
engulfing the world, he is prepared to do without sleep -- <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON> puts in a mere 
four hours of sack time nightly. Uncharacteristically for one so young, <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON> 
feels the clock ticking deep in his gut. 
</P>
<P>
Kosko grew up in a largely Slavic, working-class <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION> neighborhood 
called <ORGANIZATION>Strawberry Hill</ORGANIZATION>. His childhood was an odd mixture of "Little House on 
the Prairie" and the "Lord of the Flies." The woods behind his house were great 
for woodcraft, hunting and trapping and amateur rocketry. But they were also 
the scenes of sometimes vicious B B gun, wrist-rocket and Molotov cocktail 
battles between warring neighborhood kids. Bart, his friends recall, could 
always be found in the front lines. 
</P>
<P>
"Bart was the most passionate person I ever met," recalls childhood friend 
<PERSON>Kevin Helliker</PERSON>, an author and journalist who lived two houses down from him as 
a boy. "Our sense of the Koskos was that they had more fun than anybody." 
</P>
<P>
That changed tragically in <LOCATION>Bart</LOCATION>'s 10th year, when their house burned down 
because of an electrical short. A few months later, <PERSON>Bart</PERSON>'s father, a building 
contractor, was killed in a car accident. 
</P>
<P>
"All kids have a keen sense of what's fair and not," <PERSON>Helliker</PERSON> says. "But <PERSON>Bart</PERSON> 
had this tremendous, inborn outrage at injustice. That outrage only increased 
after the death of his father." 
</P>
<P>
The financially strapped Koskos moved to a farm near <LOCATION>Lansing</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kan.</LOCATION>, where <PERSON>Bart</PERSON> 
threw himself into a variety of pastimes to escape his loneliness and anger. He 
gobbled up books on science, philosophy, literature, art and politics. Along 
with improving his karate, he taught himself how to play the mandolin, guitar, 
balalaika and piano. His friends never knew of his musical acumen until they 
read in the newspapers that he had won a national <ORGANIZATION>Young Composers Contest</ORGANIZATION>. Then 
in <DATE>1977</DATE>, he won a full scholarship to <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, having composed an orchestral 
overture to "The Count of Monte Cristo" in high school. 
</P>
<P>
As an undergraduate at <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON> decided to supplement his income by writing 
for pay. Learning that the men's adventure market was wide open, he placed 
short pieces in magazines such as Oui and Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
What motivates <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON>? "You have to understand that <PERSON>Bart</PERSON> is indignant over the 
ultimate imminence of his own death," says <PERSON>Helliker</PERSON> in an attempt to analyze 
his friend's drive to succeed in so many areas. "Last year, when we spent some 
time together, he advised me almost daily to reflect on the fact that the 
coroner would be cutting out my guts sooner than I imagine. Death was never far 
off -- it should be stared in the face on a daily basis, he said, to remind us 
we don't have time to waste." 
</P>
<P>
Kosko agrees that he views "with dread" the prospect of his own demise. 
Mortality is, in fact, what makes Bart run as if someone -- or something -- 
were chasing him. 
</P>
<P>
KOSKO'S STAY at the <ORGANIZATION>USC School of Music</ORGANIZATION> was short-lived. Although he had passed 
his graduate placement exams, he and the school differed over what he should be 
studying. "I just hated atonal music," he says. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kosko</PERSON> kept his scholarship for a year, but he was strongly urged to find 
another major. He chose philosophy and economics, eventually becoming a fan of 
free market economist <PERSON>Milton Friedman</PERSON> and a campus libertarian activist. But he 
soon ran into conceptual difficulties that might not have fazed his fellow 
students. 
</P>
<P>
"In philosophy," he explains, "one does logic. But the Aristotelian theories 
underlying it hadn't changed in 3,000 years. That is never symptomatic of a 
healthy theory. 
</P>
<P>
"I eventually abandoned philosophy because I felt that there was no room in 
academia for philosophers in the classical sense that <PERSON>Kant</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Aristotle</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Hume</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Descartes</PERSON> had been. They had done their best to master all the science and 
mathematics of their day. In many cases they actually contributed to it. I 
began checking out math books." Kosko went on, in fact, to secure a master's 
degree in mathematics and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering, which he viewed as 
a field in which most of his scientific interests converged. 
</P>
<P>
Kosko's fuzzy road to <LOCATION>Damascus</LOCATION> ran through <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tex.</LOCATION>, where he met Zadeh at 
an artificial intelligence conference in <DATE>1984</DATE>. A year before that, he first saw 
the word fuzzy in a scientific paper. Kosko recalls being struck by revelatory 
wonder. "This really seemed to tie together many of my concerns," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
At the conference, <PERSON>Zadeh</PERSON> was fiercely attacked for his ideas. <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON>, a young 
graduate student, without a doctorate much less professional standing, stood in 
front of a room filled with the Pharisees of the scientific community and 
mounted an impassioned defense of a concept of fuzziness, although the 
mathematical questions had not been asked or answered. (Two years later at 
another conference, this same fervor would induce one scientist to bang on a 
table in Kruschevian fury, yelling that "a set is a set is a set.") Zadeh was 
impressed. Immediately afterward, <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON> mailed Zadeh a theorem supporting 
fuzziness. Zadeh eventually became <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON>'s thesis adviser. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON> attended another conference at which a well-known 
probabilist insisted publicly, and almost persuasively, that <PERSON>Zadeh</PERSON> was 
violating some inherent law of nature with his theories. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember a chill going through the audience," recounts <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON>. "I suddenly 
had the sinking feeling that maybe there really is no fool like an old fool. At 
that point, I decided I had to know definitively if fuzziness was true. I was 
like a theist impelled to establish the existence of God. If it were so, I'd 
become a priest. If not, I'd be the biggest atheist that ever lived." 
</P>
<P>
After conscientious deliberation and much back-to-the-basics mathematical 
formulation, <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON> eventually decided in favor of fuzziness. His dedication 
marked him as both maverick and dangerous iconoclast. Notoriety came during the 
mid-<DATE>'80s</DATE>, when he began to vigorously champion neural networks. Now an accepted 
part of the computer world, they were as scientifically outre then as fuzziness 
is now. 
</P>
<P>
IN ADDITION TO being its prophet, <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON> has made a unique contribution to fuzzy 
set theory. He geometrized fuzziness, gave it concrete form and functionality, 
just as <LOCATION>Einstein</LOCATION> geometrized space and time. 
</P>
<P>
Kosko pictures the set of fuzzy sets as a <ORGANIZATION>Rubik</ORGANIZATION>'s cube. Each set becomes a 
point in the cube. Conventional sets occupy the corners of the cube with fuzzy 
sets occupying the rest of the cube. Each element in the fuzzy sets belongs to 
the set to a different degree. The farther the set is from the corner, the more 
it resembles its own opposite. At the midpoint, the set equals its own 
opposite. That's where the world's classical paradoxes reside, <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON> says. The 
points within the cube model ambiguity. Once within the cube, he says, we can 
accept and understand the paradoxes and ambiguities of life. 
</P>
<P>
Kosko calls this "the black hole of set theory, where a thing can be its own 
opposite." Here, for instance, you will find the proverbial cup that is half 
empty and half full, the Taoist concept of yin yang, the liar from <LOCATION>Crete</LOCATION> who 
said all Cretans are liars, <PERSON>Bertrand Russell</PERSON>'s set of all sets that are not 
members of themselves, and <ORGANIZATION>Russell</ORGANIZATION>'s barber. 
</P>
<P>
Russell's barber, <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON> explains, is a bewhiskered man who lives in a town and 
who shaves a man if and only if he does not shave himself. So who, one might 
ask, shaves the barber? If he shaves himself, by definition he does not. But if 
he doesn't, he does. 
</P>
<P>
This kind of speculation is enough to drive most Westerners crazy, and 
according to the annals of mathematical history, many have despaired over 
resolving such enigmas. But, <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON> says, despair only sets in if one rigidly 
ascribes to an arbitrary insistence on bivalence. People in the <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION>, he 
says, would not likely fall into such a trap. In societies where Buddhism is 
common, such as <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> -- which he visits frequently as consultant, conference 
organizer and general representative of what many Japanese corporations 
consider the future of technology -- the idea of a thing containing its own 
opposite is not hard to accept. It may, in fact, be a characteristic of mature 
civilizations that they are simply more capable of recognizing fundamental 
limits in man's ability to know the real world. 
</P>
<P>
"In the end," he says, "the insistence on either / or interpretations of 
reality, which Western science relies upon, is merely a cultural preference." 
</P>
<P>
Fuzzy proponents believe that fuzzy thinking may hold the key to the 
development of the kind of artificial intelligence suggested by <ORGANIZATION>HAL</ORGANIZATION>, the 
computer in <ORGANIZATION>Stanley Kubrick</ORGANIZATION>'s film, "2001: A Space Odyssey." <PERSON>Katsushige Mita</PERSON>, 
president of <ORGANIZATION>Hitachi Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the board of LIFE, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s new 
Laboratory for <ORGANIZATION>International Fuzzy Engineering Research</ORGANIZATION> (which is funded by the 
<ORGANIZATION>Ministry of International Trade and Industry</ORGANIZATION> and more than 45 of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s 
largest high-tech corporations), believes that "fuzzy artificial intelligence 
will play an important role in the future intimate relationship between men and 
computers." 
</P>
<P>
Already, manufacturers in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> are spinning off a host of applications, from 
air conditioners, camcorders and automobile transmissions to subway trains and 
stock-trading programs. All use fuzzy chips that enables control systems to 
smooth out functions that otherwise might oscillate between minimum and maximum 
values. 
</P>
<P>
Many American scientists insist that probability can do anything fuzziness can, 
and generally with better results. Only one <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> company, <PERSON>Togai Infralogic</PERSON> of 
<LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION>, designs and produces fuzzy chips. Some critics argue that the concept 
of fuzziness has never been articulated in a manner scientists could validate. 
<PERSON>Judea Pearl</PERSON>, a professor of computer science at <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>, says he is "still waiting 
for a good definition of what a fuzzy system actually is. I haven't yet seen 
one that is divorced from jargon." 
</P>
<P>
"Any problem which fuzzy technique is designed to handle can be solved just as 
well, if not better, within a probabilistic framework," adds <PERSON>Peter C. 
Cheeseman</PERSON>, a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION>Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science</ORGANIZATION> 
now on contract with <ORGANIZATION>NASA Ames Research Center</ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. Scientists 
there are exploring fuzzy control techniques for space-shuttle docking 
maneuvers. Cheeseman is not impressed by these efforts. According to <PERSON>Cheeseman</PERSON> 
and other digital purists, <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON> and other fuzzy advocates have vastly oversold 
the benefits of their reasoning. Fuzziness, by its very nature, may lead to 
unreliable systems. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want to be on a spacecraft being docked by fuzzy techniques," he 
says. "It may work well <PERCENT>99%</PERCENT> of the time until, whoops, hey, no space station!" 
</P>
<P>
KOSKO'S CRITICS must wonder how long he can remain so brash. Burnouts are no 
rarity in science, and <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON>, who for five years has been passionately 
campaigning for fuzziness, seems to be pushing his luck. Those who know him 
well, however, have few such qualms. 
</P>
<P>
"In <LOCATION>Einstein</LOCATION>'s day," recalls <PERSON>Robert Hecht-Nielsen</PERSON>, a former colleague of 
<PERSON>Kosko</PERSON>'s who is now owner and president of a high-tech firm in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, "there 
were a number of great intellects who did amazing things. But they never 
achieved <PERSON>Einstein</PERSON>'s prominence, despite their talent, because they had no 
staying power. I'm not comparing <PERSON>Bart to Einstein</PERSON> in any definitive sense, but 
I do think he can hang in there." 
</P>
<P>
So, <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON> believes, can fuzziness. He says that it will ultimately make 
possible genuine reasoning systems in machine intelligence, where artificial 
intelligence and neural network approaches have failed. Working a fundamental 
change in the way people regard the world, however, will take decades, if not 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
To this day, Westerners have not yet faced, in any deep sense, the inherent 
screwiness of the physical universe as demonstrated by physicists during the 
early decades of this century. Eventually, <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON> says, "our physical 
explorations of subatomic reality, antimatter, and the space-time fabric will 
probably lead us to entirely different times and places, different definitions 
of reality." 
</P>
<P>
"There may be no God but the Mathmaker," <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON> has written. "And Science is his 
prophet." <PERSON>Kosko</PERSON>'s own prophecies, he prefers to make known in his upcoming 
science-fiction movie. The one thing we can count on, he says, is that 
fuzziness is here to stay. 
</P>
<P>
The question, however, is to what degree.

algorithms. If World War I was the chemist's war because of the poisonous
gases used and World War II the physicist's war because of the atomic bomb,
then this war could be justifiably called the mathematician's war.;

missile and the intercepting Patriot missile must be calculated forward in
three dimensions. All of this involves the use of complex algorithms, or

consciousness debate

SHADOWS OF THE MIND by <ORGANIZATION>Roger Penrose Oxford University Press Pounds 19.99</ORGANIZATION>,
457 pages
One of the greatest mysteries facing science and philosophy is the
phenomenon of consciousness. How do three-dimensional technicolour pictures
arise inside our skulls? How do we explain the perception of scents and
sounds? How does the excitation of neurons result in belief, memory, reason?
Three centuries ago <PERSON>Rene Descartes</PERSON> declared that the problem was best solved
by being ignored, and there are some philosophers today who agree with him.
They argue that the supreme difficulty of the problem is a result of the
fact that the human mind just is not built to understand its own basis -
rather like the impossibility of an eyeball seeing itself. Fortunately the
pessimists are in the minority, and an exciting worldwide programme of
debate and research continues.
<PERSON>Roger Penrose</PERSON>, who is a professor of mathematics at <LOCATION>Oxford</LOCATION>, is one of the
leading contributors to that debate. In his previous and much applauded book
The Emperor's New Mind he attacked currently fashionable attempts to explain
consciousness by thinking of the brain as a computer, and argued instead
that something quite new is needed in science to give us the materials for
an explanation. In this book he tells us what that new something might be.
To attack the 'computational model' of mind is a significant matter, because
upon it turn two important related hopes. One is that we will one day build
computers powerful enough to be genuinely intelligent, and the other is that
the way to understand consciousness is to disentangle the enormous
complexity of the brain's billions of internal connections - a task of great
practical difficulty, but not in principle impossible.
Penrose argues that the computational model cannot explain consciousness,
and especially the all-important conscious phenomenon of 'understanding.'
The reason lies in the notion of 'computation' itself. As the term suggests,
computation is what computers do. It consists in the ordered running of
specified procedures, even in the case of 'bottom-up' systems which can
teach themselves and thus modify and evolve as they go along. In <LOCATION>Penrose</LOCATION>'s
view, even the most sophisticated computational models cannot simulate
consciousness for the good reason that the latter has something
fundamentally non-computational about it. In the first part of his book he
explains what this means. In the second he tries to identify
non-computational features of the human brain's activity.
It is crucial for <PERSON>Penrose</PERSON> that 'non-computational' should not be taken to
denote something mystical or non-scientific. He believes that consciousness
can be understood by science - but that it will have to be an extended
science: one which includes new ways of thinking about the 'intermediate
level' between the microscopic world described by quantum physics, and the
everyday world of ordinary objects described by classical physics. This is
the topic of the book's second part, where <PERSON>Penrose</PERSON> explores new ways of
thinking about the connections between brain-cells - the synapses - the
proposal being that they behave in non-computational ways describable only
by laws intermediate between the quantum and classical levels.
There is a great deal of challenging mathematics and science in this book.
Penrose's argument against the computational model of mind turns on a
particular application of the famous theorem discovered in <DATE>1930</DATE> by the Czech
mathematician <PERSON>Kurt Godel</PERSON>, which proves that no set of rules for proving
propositions in some formal system can ever be sufficient to establish all
the true propositions of that system. Penrose takes <PERSON>Godel</PERSON> to have shown that
no set of proof-rules can ever prove all those propositions of, say,
arithmetic which humans can know to be true. From this it follows that
'there must be more to human thinking than can ever be achieved by a
computer.'
There is such a wealth of scientific, mathematical and philosophical ideas
in <LOCATION>Penrose</LOCATION>'s book - all presented with extraordinary clarity, in a mixture
of straight discussion, fables, dialogues and diagrams - that debate about
the merits of its arguments promises to be extensive. But <PERSON>Penrose</PERSON> is
offering a genuine attempt to advance understanding of the complex questions
which surround consciousness, and even if his colleagues remain unpersuaded
by the more speculative arguments in physics and physiology in the book's
second part, there is much in the first part which those who favour the
computational approach are going to have to think about very hard indeed.
Whether or not one is persuaded by <PERSON>Penrose</PERSON>'s arguments, reading them gives
one a highly absorbing education in much contemporary science and philosophy
at their sharpest cutting edges.

<HEAD>Women Earn Nearly Quarter of Math Doctorates</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AMHERST, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women are beginning to count more in
American mathematics, according to a <ORGANIZATION>University of Massachusetts</ORGANIZATION>
professor who says they earned nearly a quarter of all the math
doctorates in the last school year.
   ``It should dispel the notion once and for all that mathematics
is a man's game,'' said Professor <PERSON>Edward Connors</PERSON>, who conducts an
annual survey of the doctorates issued in the field for the
<ORGANIZATION>American Mathematical Society</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Mathematical Association of
America</ORGANIZATION>.
   The new female doctorates, with median starting salaries of
<MONEY>$30,500</MONEY>, even made about <MONEY>$500</MONEY> a year more than their male
classmates, <PERSON>Connors</PERSON> said.
   In <DATE>1987-88</DATE>, about <PERCENT>21 percent</PERCENT> of mathematics Ph.D.s went to
women, he said. In <DATE>1989</DATE> it was a little over <PERCENT>24 percent</PERCENT>, with 313
men and 98 women earning doctorates in math.
   <PERSON>Connors</PERSON> said that the percentage rise was fueled both by
increasing numbers of women going on to graduate work in math and
the declining numbers of American men in the field.
   For the third straight year, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> colleges granted more
doctorates in math to foreign students than they did to American
citizens. Out of the 904 doctorates issued in the 1988-89 school
year, <PERCENT>46 percent</PERCENT> went to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> citizens.
   That was slightly better than in the previous year's figure of
<PERCENT>45 percent</PERCENT>, but the number of doctorates earned by Americans has
been declining since the <DATE>1976-77 school year</DATE>, when <PERCENT>76 percent</PERCENT> of
the 901 issued went to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> citizens, according to the survey.
   Although women have made up about half of the bachelor's degrees
awarded in math for more than a decade, traditionally they have not
gone on to advanced degrees, he said.
   ``It's hard to understand, because the world of mathematics
doesn't have the artificial barriers to women and minorities of
some of the other physical sciences where much of the work is done
in research groups,'' <PERSON>Connors</PERSON> said. ``Mathematicians are by and
large a bunch of loners. And the rest of the world regards them all
_ men and women _ as sort of different. ''
   <PERSON>Betty M. Vetter</PERSON>, who conducts surveys on women and minorities in
the sciences for the <ORGANIZATION>American Association</ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION>Advancement of
Science</ORGANIZATION>, said it's too soon to tell whether the <DATE>1989</DATE> statistics
signal a trend.
   However, she said the higher salaries that women mathematicians
received most likely were a glitch.
   ``The only field where women have been able to hold a slight
edge in salaries over men has been engineering and that's only at
the starting level,'' <PERSON>Ms. Vetter</PERSON> said. ``The real salary problems
occur later on, because women still do not have the same
opportunities for advancement as men.''

<BYLINE>Group Wants Commitment to Math
^By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of students interested in mathematics
have dropped out for other careers, a <ORGANIZATION>National Research Council</ORGANIZATION>
report said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> in calling for renewed commitment to math
education.
   ``The attrition rate for students in the mathematical sciences
is <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> per year, the highest among all scientific fields,''
said the report, ``Renewing <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Mathematics: Critical Resources
for the Future.''
   ``Bright young people are discouraged from pursuing careers in
the mathematical sciences because they find their career prospects
are dim.''
   The report said there were about 3.6 million ninth grade
mathematics students in <DATE>1972</DATE>. By the time they entered college as
freshmen in <DATE>1976</DATE>, the number had dropped to 294,000. In <DATE>1980</DATE> 11,000
won bachelor's degrees in mathematics; two years later 2,700
master's degrees were awarded and 400 doctorates were bestowed in
<DATE>1986</DATE>.
   ``Professors must show students that the mathematical sciences
offer both intellectual excitement and attractive career
prospects,'' said the report. ``Providing intellectual excitement
is the responsibility of the mathematical sciences community.
   ``To perceive attractive career prospects, students must see in
their own mathematics departments active, successful research
enterprises that involve graduate students, young faculty, and
senior researchers, all supported at levels competitive with those
in the other sciences and engineering.''
   A key recommendation of the report is that federal support of
mathematics education increase to <MONEY>$250 million</MONEY> annually from <MONEY>$133
million</MONEY> over the next three years.
   The report is a follow up to a <DATE>1984</DATE> study which called for <MONEY>$180
million</MONEY> a year. The committee that produced the report said that
inflation had pushed that amount to <MONEY>$225 million</MONEY>.
   The money should be used mostly to increase the numbers of
senior, junior and postdoctoral researchers and graduate research
assistants, the committee said.
   <PERSON>Edward David Jr.</PERSON>, chairman of both the <DATE>1984</DATE> and the present
study committee, said that ``I think we would be much closer'' to
realizing the goal of President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and the nation's governors of
becoming first in math and science if all of the <DATE>1984</DATE> suggestions
had been carried out.
   ``The chances are very good'' that the new report will be fully
supported ``because of the attitude of the president, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and
the governors,'' said <PERSON>David</PERSON>. ``We got everybody on our side and
chances are very good.''

<HEAD>Better Math Education, Plus Career Counseling Equals More Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Better education plus improved career
counseling is necessary to add to the pool of mathematically
skilled workers who will be needed in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> by <DATE>2000</DATE>,
the government said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Research Council</ORGANIZATION> said the demand for scientists,
engineers and technicians by the turn of the century will exceed
the <DATE>1986</DATE> level by <PERCENT>36 percent</PERCENT> _ nearly double the growth in overall
employment demand.
   Meanwhile, the council said, the college-age population is
expected to decrease <PERCENT>22 percent</PERCENT> from <DATE>1981</DATE> to <DATE>1995</DATE>. The number of
white male students, the traditional pool for scientists and
engineers, will shrink <PERCENT>34 percent</PERCENT>.
   ``A Challenge of Numbers,'' the second council report on
mathematics, describes the gap between the projected supply and
demand and the challenge facing the nation's education system.
   The first report, ``Everybody Counts,'' studied trends and needs
in math education.
   Other reports later this year will evaluate post secondary math
curriculum; discuss resources available for math instruction; and
make recommendations on how to ``ensure a healthy flow of
mathematical talent'' into an increasingly technological work force.
   Among the statistics reported <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by the council, an arm of
the <ORGANIZATION>National Academy of Sciences</ORGANIZATION>, were that:
   _By <DATE>1995</DATE>, eight of the 10 fastest growing professions will be
based on science.
   _Skills in mathematics and a post secondary education will be
needed for a majority of the 21 million new jobs created by the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economy by <DATE>2000</DATE>.
   _Math enrollments have doubled in the <DATE>past 20 years</DATE>, but
two-thirds of the enrollees have been in courses lower than
calculus.
   _The number of students receiving mathematics degrees, those who
could teach, was lower in <DATE>1986</DATE> than in <DATE>1966</DATE>.
   _The percentage of college students studying math may drop as
the proportion of blacks and Hispanics, who have traditionally
studied math at a lower rate than the general population,
increases. The two groups comprised <PERCENT>22 percent</PERCENT> of college students
in <DATE>1985</DATE>; they are expected to account for <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> by <DATE>2010</DATE>.
   _Women's interest in advanced mathematics has been low. White
women earn <PERCENT>17 percent</PERCENT> of math doctorates compared with <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT>
by their male counterparts.
   _Non-citizens comprise nearly half the graduate mathematics
population, even as the total number of doctorates awarded has
continued to fall.
   _Three-quarters of math graduates work outside academia, but no
one knows much about what they do. The lack of information ``dulls
the appeal of mathematics as a major and as a profession,'' the
study said.

   A Japanese mathematician's widely publicized
attempt to solve one of the most famous problems in mathematics
appears to have failed, a prominent American mathematician says.
   ``I think it's wrong,'' said <PERSON>Gerd Faltings</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Princeton
University</ORGANIZATION>, who has examined a 20-page manuscript prepared by
<PERSON>Yoichi Miyaoka</PERSON>.
   Faltings, who has won the discipline's prestigious Fields Medal
for work related to the problem, said <DATE>Monday</DATE> he thought the error
was fundamental enough that the proposed solution would have to be
abandoned.
   The problem is to prove <ORGANIZATION>Fermat</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Last Theorem</LOCATION>, named for the
French mathematician <PERSON>Pierre de Fermat</PERSON>, who lived from <DATE>1601</DATE> to <DATE>1665</DATE>.
   Fermat's theorum states that if X to the Nth power plus Y to the
Nth power equals Z to the Nth power, there is no solution for which
N is a whole number greater than two.
   ``Nth power'' means the accompanying number is multiplied by
itself N times. The theorem assumes that X, Y and Z are positive
whole numbers.
   Fermat wrote in the margin of a notebook that he had devised a
proof for his theorem, but it was never discovered. Coming up with
a proof has bedeviled mathematicians ever since.
   Miyaoka's proposed proof was widely reported earlier this month
after he presented it at <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Max Planck Institute</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``It looked pretty good to start out with (but now) it looks
like the details are probably not going to go through,'' said <PERSON>Peter
Renz</PERSON>, associate director of the <ORGANIZATION>Mathematical Association of America</ORGANIZATION>.
   Still, ``it's a very good way to go at the problem'' and the
approach, based on geometric work by Soviet mathematician <PERSON>A.
Parshin</PERSON>, may still pay off, <PERSON>Renz</PERSON> said.
   Previous work has proven the theorum for cases in which N is
less than 150,000, he said. For higher values, no proof is yet
available.
   Faltings had expressed doubt about the new work in the <DATE>March 30</DATE>
issue of the <ORGANIZATION>Chronicle of Higher Education</ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>  By <PERSON>Robert Kanigel</PERSON>; <ORGANIZATION>Scribner</ORGANIZATION>'s, 438 pp., <MONEY>$27.95</MONEY>.;  IT is a magic, tragic
ugly-duckling fable that <PERSON>Robert Kanigel</PERSON> tells in "The Man Who Knew Infinity":
the tale of a greatly gifted man born to a culture that doesn't understand
what the man is about.;    Still, his talent blossoms until news of it spreads
to the other side of the world, where he is eventually summoned by the masters
of his skill. The man goes among them and performs his magic. Skepticism gives
way to wonder. But away from home, the man grows lonely and ill. He returns to
his birthplace, only to die.;    The ugly duckling in question is Srinivasa
Ramanujan (pronounced rah-MAH-na-jun), the Indian clerk who in <DATE>1913</DATE> at the age
of 25 wrote a 10-page letter to <PERSON>G.H. Hardy</PERSON>, begging the eminent English
mathematician to consider some ideas <PERSON>Ramanujan</PERSON> had about numbers.;    A very
interesting number?;  The best-known anecdote about <PERSON>Ramanujan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hardy</PERSON> stems
from an incident that happened <DATE>six years later</DATE>, long after <PERSON>Hardy</PERSON>, having
recognized the genius of <PERSON>Ramanujan</PERSON>'s letter, had arranged for him to come to
<LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and study at Cambridge.;    One day, <PERSON>Hardy</PERSON> paid a call on <PERSON>Ramanujan</PERSON>
and commented with typical brusqueness that the number of the cab he had
taken, <DATE>1729</DATE>, was "rather a dull number," adding that he hoped it wasn't a bad
omen.;    "No, <LOCATION>Hardy</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Ramanujan</PERSON> replied without missing a beat. "It is a very
interesting number. It is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two
cubes in two different ways." (The two sums of cubes are 12 to the third power
plus 1 to the third, and 10 to the third plus 9 to the third.) Such was
<PERSON>Ramanujan</PERSON>'s intimacy with numbers.;    <PERSON>Kanigel</PERSON>, a journalist specializing in
science writing whose previous book was "Apprentice to Genius: The Making of a
Scientific Dynasty," conscientiously works to fill in all the details
surrounding this anecdote.;    He has apparently read every book that has
touched on <PERSON>Ramanujan</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Hardy</LOCATION>. He has traveled to <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, and has
interviewed <PERSON>Ramanujan</PERSON>'s widow, a woman in her 90s who married him by
arrangement when she was 9 years old.;    And he has exhaustively described
every building <PERSON>Ramanujan</PERSON> ever occupied, every tradition <PERSON>Ramanujan</PERSON> ever
encountered, every incident in which <PERSON>Ramanujan</PERSON> played even the tiniest role.; 
  Did World War I descend upon <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> while <PERSON>Ramanujan</PERSON> was there? Kanigel
expatiates on its causes. Did <PERSON>Ramanujan</PERSON> contract tuberculosis as a remotely
indirect result? Kanigel dilates on the bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
One senses that if his hero had worn a wristwatch, the author would have told
the history of Switzerland.;    When this technique works, the results are
enlightening. For instance, the book is as much a biography of <LOCATION>Hardy</LOCATION> as it is
of <PERSON>Ramanujan</PERSON>, and so we come to understand the revolution <PERSON>Hardy</PERSON> wrought by
insisting that English mathematicians offer formal proofs of theorems instead
of simply accepting them as tools, as was their habit.;    Thus his
collaboration with <PERSON>Hardy</PERSON> was ideal for <PERSON>Ramanujan</PERSON>, who, never having been
forced to develop proofs of his discoveries, was an ideal subject for <ORGANIZATION>Hardy</ORGANIZATION>'s
discipline.;    More often, the results of <PERSON>Kanigel</PERSON>'s exhaustiveness are mixed.
For instance, he tries to give the reader a taste of <ORGANIZATION>Ramanujan</ORGANIZATION>'s mathematics,
which focused on such esoteric subjects as infinite series, prime numbers,
partitions (or ways of separating positive whole numbers into sums of positive
whole numbers) and approximations of the ratio pi.;    This is highly
commendable, particularly given the author's contention that <PERSON>Ramanujan</PERSON>'s
intuitive gifts as a mathematician were connected to his devout religious
beliefs as a Brahman of the Vaishnava sect.;    But while one does get an
inkling of what <PERSON>Ramanujan</PERSON> was up to from the formulas that fill up some of
<PERSON>Kanigel</PERSON>'s pages, they seem mostly impenetrable to an inexpert reader. And
<PERSON>Kanigel</PERSON> does not help matters when in the very first equation he analyzes he
refers to the right side as the left one and vice versa.;    Zeal for
anecdotes;  And too often, his endless amplification strikes one as mere
padding, as if his dramatic story could not speak for itself. He repeats so
many examples of <PERSON>Ramanujan</PERSON>'s significance to posterity that he begins to sound
defensive, like certain ambivalent Indians who still take deep pride in their
compatriot's accomplishments yet simultaneously feel ashamed that their
culture did not recognize them.;    When in the heat of his enthusiasm <PERSON>Kanigel</PERSON>
writes such sentences as "In what, in some ways, was his greatest achievement,
then, <PERSON>Hardy</PERSON> brought <PERSON>Ramanujan</PERSON> mathematically up to speed without muzzling his
creativity or damping the fires of his enthusiasm," one is bound to believe
that the author has simply gone out of control.;    All the same, despite such
impediments, <PERSON>Ramanujan</PERSON>'s remarkable story does come through, largely thanks to
the many pointed anecdotes <PERSON>Kanigel</PERSON> has swept up in his sometimes
indiscriminate zeal. When <PERSON>Ramanujan</PERSON> attended a lecture on elliptic integrals
shortly after his arrival at <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, the lecturer, <PERSON>Arthur Berry</PERSON>, asked his
guest if he was able to follow. Ramanujan nodded.;    Did he care to add
anything? "At that," <PERSON>Kanigel</PERSON> writes, "Ramanujan stood, went to the blackboard,
took the chalk, and wrote down results <PERSON>Berry</PERSON> had not yet proved and which,
<PERSON>Berry</PERSON> concluded later, he could not have known before.";    This serves only
to confirm what <PERSON>Hardy</PERSON> said he believed in <DATE>1913</DATE> upon first looking at
<ORGANIZATION>Ramanujan</ORGANIZATION>'s theorems, which, <PERSON>Hardy</PERSON> would write, "defeated me completely.";   
"I had never seen anything in the least like them before," he continued. "A
single look at them is enough to show that they could only be written down by
a mathematician of the highest class." Then in a typical flourish he
concluded, "They must have been true because, if they were not true, no one
would have the imagination to invent them."  </TEXT>

FT  11 NOV 94 / Bell rings at end of six-year dispute

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Yesterday's curriculum announcement may have been the final act of a dispute
which has convulsed education since <DATE>1988</DATE>.
The concept of a national curriculum had broad backing when it was
introduced as part of <PERSON>Mr Kenneth Baker</PERSON>'s Education Reform Act. Religious and
physical education had previously been the only compulsory subjects, and
education in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION> was felt to be wildly out of step with that
of other <LOCATION>European Union</LOCATION> nations.
However, <PERSON>Mr Baker</PERSON> split with his prime minister, <PERSON>Mrs Margaret Thatcher</PERSON>, over
the form the curriculum should take. She favoured a curriculum that simply
ensured all children had been taught a basic core of subjects. <PERSON>Mr Baker</PERSON>,
whose view prevailed, preferred a more ambitious prescriptive curriculum.
Once the officials at the education department started drawing up the
curriculum a second problem became apparent. The current education
secretary, <PERSON>Mrs Gillian Shephard</PERSON>, referred to it yesterday: 'It is
understandable that when you set up a national curriculum there is likely to
be a tension between looking after teachers' workload, and the desire from
subject specialists to put more and more and more into the curriculum.'
As a result, teachers complained that the original curriculum, compiled by
enthusiastic subject experts, took up all of class time.
Testing proved a second - and critical - problem. The curriculum had been
designed for continuous assessment by teachers, with long descriptions of
pupils' attainments and tasks for children to perform. Its tests were meant
simply to help 'diagnose' individual pupils' problems.
But in <DATE>1991</DATE> <PERSON>Mr Kenneth Clarke</PERSON>, then education secretary, announced plans to
publish league tables of schools' performances in the tests. He appointed
<PERSON>Lord Griffiths</PERSON>, chairman of the rightwing <ORGANIZATION>Institute of Policy Studies
think-tank</ORGANIZATION>, to run the quango administering the curriculum. His brief was to
produce simple 'paper and pencil' tests.
The first tests for 14-year-olds were scheduled to be taken in <DATE>1993</DATE>.
However, English teachers reacted angrily to the first draft test papers
published in <DATE>January</DATE>. All three of the main teachers' unions boycotted the
tests. They were taken in less than <MONEY>5 per cent</MONEY> of state schools.
<PERSON>Mr John Patten</PERSON>, who succeeded <PERSON>Mr Clarke</PERSON>, appointed Sir <PERSON>Ron Dearing</PERSON> to review
the curriculum in <DATE>April 1993</DATE>, in an attempt to persuade the teachers to
abandon their boycott. It failed.
Sir <PERSON>Ron</PERSON> appeared yesterday to have produced a package which would keep <PERSON>Mrs
Shephard</PERSON> in position rather longer than her predecessors.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
THE FINAL REVISION: WHAT EVERY CHILD SHOULD KNOW
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
The national curriculum must be studied in all state schools in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION>, by children aged 5-16. Its compulsory core subjects are
English, mathematics, science and design &amp; technology. Subsidiary
subjects are modern languages (compulsory only from age 11), information
technology and physical education (both compulsory throughout); and
history, geography, art and music (optional from age 14). Children are
expected to have been taught certain subjects and topics by the end of
'key stages' one (at age 7), two (11), three (14) and four (16). At the
end of each key stage, children must be assessed on whether they have
reached defined attainment targets. This is checked by pupils' coverage
of 200 'level descriptions' which describe the level they should have
reached. Assessment in each subject follows a 10-level scale. The aim is
for the most able to reach level 10 by age 16.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
At key stage one (age 7):
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
English: pupils must be introduced 'with appropriate sensitivity' to the
  importance of standard English.
Maths: emphasis is on mastering basic arithmetic (addition, division,
  subtraction, multiplication).
Science: pupils should be taught about 'systematic enquiry', and science
  'in everyday life'. Basic biology and physics.
The main changes: Tougher on traditional grammar than before. Proposals
  to correct pupils for speaking non-standard English, even in the
  playground, have been dropped.
  Study of specifically British history compulsory for the first time.
  In science, study of electricity is now compulsory.
  In maths, children must learn to work without calculators.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
At key stage two (age 11):
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
English: pupils to learn to plan, draft, revise, proof-read and present
  written material, and read 'a range of modern fiction by significant
  children's authors'.
Maths: applied mathematics, including interpreting basic statistics,
  probability theory, and building 2- and 3-dimensional shapes.
Science: work on materials, building simple electrical circuits,
  basic astronomy.
Technology: pupils to work with 'a range of materials and components',
  and recognise hazards.
The main changes: There is to be more emphasis on mental arithmetic in
  maths and less work on nutrition in science. Work on energy and
  resources deferred until secondary school. The requirement to study
  the history of technology dropped. Pupils are to attempt a recognised
  version of a team game in PE.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
At key stage three (age 14):
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
English: students to have read at least two <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION> plays, plus a
  range of classic authors.
Maths: pupils should use graphs, algebra, geometry.
Science: biology, chemistry and physics.
Technology: pupils must learn designing skills and about systems and
  control.
The main changes: Requirement on number of different technology subjects
  to be covered dropped. Pupils can specialise in only one.
  Algebra and number made separate mathematical topics.
  Reading list of prescribed pre-20th century writers but teachers can
  choose their own 20th-century authors.
  Extra emphasis on IT and media studies.
  Extra coverage of chemistry within general science.
  British history to be 'set in European and world perspective'.

<TEXT>
   In the <DATE>late 15th century</DATE>, <LOCATION>Venice</LOCATION> was the commercial capital of the Western world, the center of a vast network of international trade. 
The spirit of the period was captured by the merchant <PERSON>Francesco di Marco Datim</PERSON>, who headed every page of his ledgers, "in the name of God and Profit." 

   Then, as now, business ran on numbers. 
Profits of complex partnerships had to be divided, tare and tret determined, supplies purchased and accounts kept. 
Barter and currency exchanges involved calculations considered elaborate at the time. 
Commerce depended on trained computers, which in those days were people who knew how to compute. 

   To meet the need for commercial computers, reckoning masters in many European cities founded schools for teen-age boys and wrote manuals for them. 
Unlike the Latin mathematics texts used in universities, which aimed at a small elite, the commercial arithmetic texts were written in vernacular languages for the children of merchants and civil servants. 
While university texts continued to teach arithmetic in Roman numerals, texts of commercial arithmetic taught the new and controversial Hindu-Arabic numerals, known as "mercantile figures." 

   The compactness of Hindu-Arabic numerals, which actually originated in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, and the ease of doing arithmetic with them, made them obviously superior for business. 
The ease of learning arithmetic based on the new numerals made them a threat to the universities' monopoly on computational knowledge. 

   The first known dated book of mathematics printed with movable type was a commercial arithmetic text published in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, where the demands for it from practical businessmen were greatest. 
It appeared in <DATE>1478</DATE> in <LOCATION>Treviso</LOCATION>, a center of trading and industry a day's travel north of <LOCATION>Venice</LOCATION>. 
Lacking both title and author's name, it is known simply as the <LOCATION>Treviso</LOCATION> Arithmetic. 

   The state of arithmetic in <DATE>1478</DATE> can hardly be imagined now. 
Though addition and subtraction had become fairly standardized, eight methods of multiplication and four methods of long division were practiced. 
The form of long division taught today in American elementary schools was still unborn. 
Decimal fractions, the basis of dollars and cents, lay more than a century in the future. 
Of the four standard symbols for the arithmetic operations, not one had yet been invented. 
Verbal circumlocutions were required to state problems and to describe methods of solution because algebraic symbols were still unknown in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. 

   "Capitalism and Arithmetic: The New Math of the 15th Century" (Open Court Press, 315 5th Street, <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION> 61354; 345 pages; <MONEY>$16.95</MONEY>), by the historian <PERSON>Frank J. Swetz</PERSON>, tells the fascinating story of the <ORGANIZATION>Treviso Arithmetic</ORGANIZATION> and its connection with every aspect of late medieval and early Renaissance life. 
A readable complete English translation of the original <ORGANIZATION>Treviso Arithmetic</ORGANIZATION> is included. 

   In <PERSON>Mr. Swetz</PERSON>'s learned and engrossing commentary on the text, you can find facts that will impress your boss and amaze your friends, such as the mathematical origins of the words "counter" (as in "over-the-counter"), "bank," "bankruptcy" and "digits." 
You also will learn how the percent symbol came about, and how it was first determined that there should be a horizontal line between a subtraction problem and its answer. 
There is even an old method of multiplying many-digit numbers that is clearly superior to the one now taught in schools. 

   The rich historical details support a compelling account of how mercantile capitalism in the Venetian republic of the early Renaissance crucially influenced the evolution of mathematics and how mathematics helped the rise of capitalism. 

   The demands of business brought European mathematics out of the clouds. 
The incessant repetition of problems of similar form stimulated the advance from rhetorical algebra to symbolic algebra. 
By no accident, <LOCATION>Venice</LOCATION> was the first European city to endow public lectures on algebra. 
Widespread demand in the business community for the new methods of Hindu-Arabic arithmetic stimulated innovations in printing. 
Printing in turn speeded the standardization of mathematical notation. 

   Like two legs of a runner, mathematics and mercantilism each propelled the other, whereas separately they only had hopped. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Treviso Arithmetic of 1478</ORGANIZATION> finds its counterpart today in the how-to-compute books of every popular bookstore. 
International ventures, intricate collaborations, manufacturing, banking, transportation, accounting and risk management required then and require now unprecedented calculations. 
The computational ease and power that Hindu-Arabic numerals offered half a millennium ago are paralleled today by the software that drives electronic computers. 
Some of that software automates mathematics developed specifically for business -- linear programming, for example -- but most draws on a deep reservoir of unexpectedly useful mathematics accumulated since <DATE>1478</DATE>.

   Mathematicians gathered here to
celebrate a century of advances that have benefitted fields ranging
from medicine to business and have seen American scientists rise to
the top of the discipline.
   ``When we talk about mathematics generally 100 years ago it was
a thriving enterprise,'' said <PERSON>Ronald Douglas</PERSON>, 49, dean of physical
science and mathematics at the <ORGANIZATION>University of New York</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Stony
Brook</LOCATION>. ``Even so whole new areas have been developed.''
   <PERSON>Douglas</PERSON> was one of about 1,300 mathematicians here for a
weeklong meeting that opened <DATE>Monday</DATE> to celebrate the centennial
anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION>American Mathematical Society</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Geometricians who lived 100 years ago would not believe how
large the field has become,'' he said. ``It now interacts with all
of the sciences, with biology, with business, with medicine, with
economics. I think this would surprise people.''
   The computer alone has allowed mathematicians to solve problems
today that only existed in theory 20 or 30 years ago, he said.
   <PERSON>Douglas</PERSON> said the advances in mathematics in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>
have been remarkable.
   ``Mathematics had a small number of American mathematicians _
all of them trained in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Douglas</PERSON>. ``Now American
mathematics is pre-eminent in the world, having the leadership in
many areas of mathematics. People come from all over the world to
study here. <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> is still important but the balance has shifted.''
   Mathematics will continue to move further into medicine and
biology, and new understandings in physics will allow
mathematicians to develop better machines and computers, he said.
   The society, originally named the <ORGANIZATION>New York Mathematical Society</ORGANIZATION>,
was formed in <DATE>1888</DATE> by a small group of mathematicians. It moved its
headquarters to <LOCATION>Providence</LOCATION> in <DATE>1951</DATE>.
   This week's meeting is one of two the society holds each year in
conjunction with the <ORGANIZATION>Mathematical Society of America</ORGANIZATION>, society
spokeswoman <PERSON>Kathleen Holmay</PERSON> said.
   Speakers will address issues ranging from computer graphics to
the problems of attracting women to the field. Only about <PERCENT>15
percent</PERCENT> of the society's 21,000 members are female, <PERSON>Ms. Holmay</PERSON> said.
   Of the 18 speakers at the conference, only one is a woman. <PERSON>Karen
K. Uhlenbeck</PERSON>, 46, a mathematics professor at the <ORGANIZATION>University of
Texas</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION>, will speak <DATE>Friday</DATE> on ``Instantons and their
Relatives.'' Instantons are geometric objects discovered by
physicists.

The Dangers of Abstraction

<DD> 04/16/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   Mathematics is a <PERSON>Dr. Jekyll</PERSON> and a <PERSON>Mr. Hyde</PERSON>. 
Computers, the visible instruments of mathematics, are all around us. 
Yet stories of the remoteness of mathematics and of mathematicians are legion. 
For example, <PERSON>C.N. Yang</PERSON>, a Nobel laureate in physics, once explained the difference between a physics book and a mathematics book. 
A physics book is one you can't read after the first page. 
A mathematics book is one you can't read after the first sentence. 

   Not all mathematicians think their subject is so remote. 
In <DATE>1983</DATE>, in their first book, "The Mathematical Experience," <PERSON>Philip J. Davis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Reuben Hersh</PERSON> humanized mathematics as an activity of passionate, fallible men and women. 
The book told what it feels like to do and love mathematics. 
It won the <DATE>1983</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>American Book Award in Science</ORGANIZATION>. 
Properly understood, mathematics, the fearsome <PERSON>Mr. Hyde</PERSON>, became a lovable uncle. 

   In a new book, "Descartes' Dream: The World According to Mathematics" (<ORGANIZATION>Harcourt Brace Jovanovich</ORGANIZATION>, 321 pages, <MONEY>$19.95</MONEY>), <PERSON>Messrs. 
Davis</PERSON>, professor of applied mathematics at <ORGANIZATION>Brown University</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Hersh</PERSON>, professor of mathematics at the <ORGANIZATION>University of New Mexico</ORGANIZATION>, report on the practical <PERSON>Dr. Jekyll</PERSON>: the mathematics of business and industry, medicine and law, government and war. 

   In business, for example, mathematics helps design the bodies of autos and aircraft to reduce air turbulence; helps schedule manufacturing, analyzes the failures of parts, suggests how to inventory spares, optimizes distribution to points of sale, helps set finance charges for credit sales and so on. 
Mathematics continues to contribute to the growth of national productivity in almost every sphere of life in technologically advanced countries. 

   Descartes and <PERSON>Leibniz</PERSON> dreamed in the <DATE>17th century</DATE> that all human actions could be guided by mathematical reasoning. 
They would be amazed to see how much of their dream is true today. 

   Unlike <PERSON>Descartes</PERSON> and <PERSON>Leibniz</PERSON>, but like many humanists of the past and present, <PERSON>Messrs. 
Davis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hersh</PERSON> fear that mathematics has penetrated our lives too far. 
Their fear derives from the secret of mathematics' success, abstraction. 

   Mathematics replaces complex processes or situations with symbols and simplified rules for manipulating those symbols. 
The symbols and the rules ignore everything about the real world except what is essential to the mathematician's or scientist's purpose. 
Scientists use mathematical abstractions to figure out the consequences of their assumptions. 
They can also test their assumptions by comparing mathematically derived consequences with observable reality. 
The symbolic abstractions that replaced falling bodies, planets, chemicals and chromosomes have given people astounding power. 

   When the purpose of the abstraction is to deal with people, however, there are potential dangers. 
"The final intent of the application of mathematics to people," the authors write, "is to be able to compare two individuals or groups of individuals, to be able to arrive at a precise and definitive opinion as to which is taller, smarter, richer, healthier, happier, more prolific, which is entitled to more goods and more prestige, and ultimately, when this weapon of thought is pushed to its logical limits and cruelly turned around, which is the most useless and hence the most disposable . . . 
Whenever we use computerization to proceed from formulas and algorithms to policy and to actions affecting humans, we stand open to good and to evil on a massive scale." 

   Messrs. 
<PERSON>Davis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hersh</PERSON> suggest that "advanced mathematization, through abstraction and subsequent loss of meaning, played a role" in the <LOCATION>Holocaust</LOCATION>. 
"It is no accident that the great evils of the period 1933-1945 were perpetrated in a country that was the world leader in theoretical science and mathematics . . . 
Numbers, tattooed on the arms of the victims, reduced them to the level of branded cattle." 
Beneath the bedside manner of the mathematical <PERSON>Dr. Jekyll</PERSON> lurks a <LOCATION>Faust</LOCATION>. 

   This mathematical self-flagellation is absurd. 
Replacing individuals and groups by abstractions is an older and deeper part of human experience than mathematics. 
The Chosen People fight the Amalekites. 
Armies distinguish enemies and allies, privates and generals. 
The law recognizes classes of creditors, stockholders and debtors. 
Hospitals, universities, corporations and unions all deal with people abstractly. 

   The problem lies not in using mathematics to approximate features of people, as the authors suggest, but in using the inadequate mathematics of falling bodies, planets, chemicals and chromosomes to approximate people poorly. 
Here I betray my optimism and sympathy for <ORGANIZATION>Descartes</ORGANIZATION>'s dream. 

   The computer, drudge extraordinaire, is as happy storing 10 million numbers to characterize <PERSON>Johnny Jones</PERSON>, second grader, as it is storing only his IQ. 
The challenge is to choose the numbers wisely and to comprehend them. 
Once the human population outgrew the face-to-face group of a few dozen individuals, there was no escaping the masks we put over others' faces. 
With better mathematics and better instruments of mathematics, we can try to give those masks human features. 

   This is Mathematics Awareness Week. 
The new book by Messrs. 
<PERSON>Davis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hersh</PERSON> could be just your number. 
Even if it's half wrong, it's at least half right, and that's better than most books on the subject.

<HEAD>Group Backs Voluntary Standards, Increased Use of Computers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is a hands-down loser when it
comes to mathematics education and needs major reforms, including
voluntary national standards, to upgrade math achievement, says a
report released <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   Three out of four <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> students leave high school without
mastering enough mathematics to cope with either job demands or the
expectations of colleges, said the report by the <ORGANIZATION>National Research
Council</ORGANIZATION>, an arm of the <ORGANIZATION>National Academy of Sciences</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>National
Academy of Engineering</ORGANIZATION>.
   The report, ``Everybody Counts,'' says piecemeal local efforts to
correct the nation's math teaching deficiencies are ``totally
inadequate'' and calls for forward-looking national standards to be
adopted by local school systems.
   A recent surge of studies and books has raised concern over the
nation's mathematical skills, with another major study _ an
international survey of math and science performance _ due next week
from the <ORGANIZATION>Educational Testing Service</ORGANIZATION>.
   <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s report reflects the consensus of 70 teachers,
administrators, researchers, executives, parents and government
officials who spent three years studying math education from
kindergarten through graduate school.
   The council concludes that teaching must move away from
pencil-and-paper techniques and memorization toward realistic
problem-solving and early use of computers and calculators, which
the report said have had ``virtually no impact'' on instruction
despite their great potential to enrich it.
   The group said that teachers should be moderators, not lecturers
and that students should take math every year they are in school.
   The authors point to two approaches they say won't work:
   _The ``back to basics'' movement, favored by those who think of
math as an anchor in a sea of change. ``It isn't sufficient to
simply do better on traditional programs,'' <PERSON>Shirley Hill</PERSON>, chairman
of the <ORGANIZATION>Mathematical Sciences Education Board</ORGANIZATION>, told a news
conference. ``Math changes. The curriculum must keep up. We must be
contemporary.''
   _The ``top-down'' Japanese approach of enforcing a national,
grade-by-grade curriculum. While nations adopting such an approach
``have beaten us hands-down,'' the report said, the technique would
be impractical in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   The report sasy that ``new math'' was imposed from the top down
and fell flat because teachers and parents were not involved in the
process. The council suggests, instead, what it calls an augmented
grass roots approach _ voluntary, flexible standards with a broad
base of public support.
   A major step toward that goal is expected next month, when the
<ORGANIZATION>National Council of Teachers of Mathematics</ORGANIZATION> publishes ``Curriculum
and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics.'' The research
council called the upcoming study `the first effort ever to
establish national expectations for school mathematics'' and said
draft copies are already influencing textbook publishers and testing
organizations.
   In addition to low math achievement and a stagnant math
curriculum, the authors of ``Everybody Counts'' noted a number of
other problems:
   _The shortage of qualified math teachers is more serious than in
any other area of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> education and affects all levels from
elementary to graduate school. The shortage of minority math
teachers is particularly acute.
   _The conventional wisdom is that some people are just bad at
math. But in other industrialized nations, all students are expected
to master a level of math attained only by the best <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> students.
The result is that <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> firms are at a competitive disadvantage.
   _<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> industry spends as much annually on remedial math education
as is spent on math education in schools, colleges and universities
combined.

A Chinese saying tells us that 'orchids fear the Taylor-bird's song, but
chrysanthemums survive autumn's frosts'; which means that early developers
fade early whereas late developers go from strength to strength. This is an
optimistic saying; there is hope for us all yet.
Hobbes was a chrysanthemum. At the age of 46 he fell in love with geometry,
and suddenly blossomed into an intellectual giant; despite Parkinson's
disease later, and perhaps because he sang to himself every night as a way
of keeping fit (he said it cleared his lungs), he lived to the grand age of
92, producing scientific, mathematical and philosophical works which had a
profound influence upon the birth of modern times.
These two volumes constitute the first collection of Hobbes's known
correspondence, and their publication is therefore an important literary and
philosophical event. There are letters here between Hobbes and - among many
others - <PERSON>Pierre Gassendi</PERSON>, <PERSON>John Aubrey</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Marin Mersenne</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Gottfried Leibniz</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Cosimo de Medici</PERSON>, and <PERSON>King Charles II</PERSON>, whose mathematics tutor Hobbes had
been. Almost half have not previously been published. They open a window
onto many aspects of the 17th-century world; anyone interested in history,
literature, politics, philosophy and the history of science will find them
utterly absorbing.
The editor of these handsome volumes is a man whom Hobbes and his
correspondents would have recognised as someone of their own stamp: a fine
scholar who nevertheless engages with the world outside the academy. <PERSON>Noel
Malcolm</PERSON>, political correspondent on the <ORGANIZATION>Daily Telegraph</ORGANIZATION> and sometime Fellow
of <LOCATION>Gonville</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Caius College</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, has done an outstanding job of
translating all the <LOCATION>Latin</LOCATION>, Greek, French and Italian in the correspondence,
providing excellent introductory material and biographical notices of
Hobbes's correspondents. A reading of the letters and this elegantly written
apparatus amounts to an education in the history of 17th century thought.
Hobbes's most famous work is unquestionably the Leviathan, his great
treatise of political philosophy. This work, together with the scientific
and psychological theories he developed in connection with it, made him
celebrated throughout continental <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, but a figure of obloquy in his own
country - partly because of the virulent anti-clericalism of his ideas,
which made him seem an atheist, but also because the conclusion of his
political theory is an uncomfortable one; namely, that the best form of
government is absolute rule by a single sovereign power.
Hobbes based this theory on his view of human nature, of which he took a
deeply pessimistic view. Humans, he said, are greedy, selfish and
distrustful, and will prey upon one another unless they are restrained by
fear of a coercive power. Civil society comes into existence to give people
protection against each other; each individual yields up, by consent, some
of his liberty in return for security. But the logical terminus of this,
Hobbes argued, is that full security is best achieved if there is a single
absolute sovereign exercising power over all. The sovereign power might be a
collective body, like parliament, or a monarch. Hobbes preferred the latter,
on the grounds that a monarch will not be weakened by internal divisions, as
might happen in a collective body.
By postulating human nature rather than religion or tradition as the ground
of civil society, Hobbes thought he had moved political theory into the
realms of science. His ideas provoked strong resistance in many quarters,
but his methods proved influential; his reliance on reason and experience
helped to free subsequent philosophy from its thraldom to scholasticism and
theology.
It is one of the oddities of national temperament that whereas Hobbes's
continental friends - many of whom, like <PERSON>Gassendi</PERSON>, were priests - were
tolerant towards his attacks on religion, in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> his views were regarded
with horror. In <DATE>1666</DATE>, after the plague and Fire of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, people began
looking for reasons why God was punishing <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, and a flurry of
heretic-hunting began. A parliamentary committee considered a bill 'against
<ORGANIZATION>Atheisme Blasphemy</ORGANIZATION> or Prophaneness . . . And in perticular . . . the booke
of <PERSON>Mr Hobbes</PERSON> called the Leviathan'. Hobbes was saved from this threat,
probably by <PERSON>Charles II</PERSON>, who was fond of him; but his reputation as a
maverick remained.
Interest in <LOCATION>Hobbes</LOCATION> has been steadily reviving in recent years, and <PERSON>Malcolm</PERSON>'s
magnificent edition of his correspondence will help to spur that process. No
one has to agree with Hobbes to appreciate his achievement; failure to
understand this fact is one of the reasons why <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> is often so slow to
applaud its own.

<TEXT>
   A new magazine published by three teachers'
groups will give American students the chance to puzzle over the
same math and physics problems that confound Soviet high school
students, the organizations announced <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   The English-language magazine, called Quantum, is being
published by te <ORGANIZATION>National Science Teachers Association</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>American
Association of Physics Teachers</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>National Council of
Teachers of Mathematics</ORGANIZATION> in a joint effort with the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Academy of Sciences</ORGANIZATION>.
   But <PERSON>Bill Aldridge</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>NSTA</ORGANIZATION>, cautions that
Quantum is not for the average American student.
   ``It is aimed at students who are curious and want to solve
puzzles in physics and math,'' <PERSON>Aldridge</PERSON> said. ``It's aimed at the
very able student.''
   Most of the material in the first issue is based on articles and
problems that first appeared in <LOCATION>Kvant</LOCATION>, a popular Soviet magazine
for high school students.
   It includes problems in advanced geometry, algebra and in basic
physics, all presented in a lively, colorful way and applied to
actual objects and observations.
   There are also chess games and profiles of famous Soviet and
American scientists.
   ``The magazine has a little more life and is more connected to
what mathematicians really do,'' said <PERSON>William Thurston</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Princeton
University</ORGANIZATION> math professor who is the Quantum editor for
mathematics. He said the magazine will offer advanced problems in
math and physics that students normally would not confront in a
typical high school classroom.
   <PERSON>Aldridge</PERSON> said that Kvant carries articles and problems written
by top Soviet scientists and are designed to challenge Soviet
students.
   ``In the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, ambitious parents subscribe for their
children, hoping that they can get them into the university,''
<PERSON>Aldridge</PERSON> said.
   Eventually, he said, it is hoped that American scientists will
contribute articles to Quantum that would later be translated for
use in <LOCATION>Kvant</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Aldridge</PERSON> said a computer and a laser printer, donated by the
Americans, have been installed in the Soviet offices of Kvant so
that articles can be transmitted by satellite to the Quantum
editorial offices in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Aldridge</PERSON> said President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> presented the first copy of Quantum
to Soviet President <PERSON>Mikhail Gorbachev</PERSON> when the two met for their
shipboard summit in <LOCATION>Malta</LOCATION>.
   The first edition carries little advertising, and <PERSON>Aldridge</PERSON> said
it will take about three years for the magazine to reach the
break-even point economically. Until then, it is being supported by
a <MONEY>$366,000</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION> grant.
   The magazine will be published quarterly and the annual
subscription rate is <MONEY>$9.95</MONEY>.

There has been a chorus of warnings that the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> suffers from poor 
math and science teaching. Now <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s largest scientific organization has 
come forward with a plan for reform. 
</P>
<P>
Declaring that "<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> has no more urgent priority," the <ORGANIZATION>American Assn.</ORGANIZATION> for 
the <ORGANIZATION>Advancement of Science</ORGANIZATION> envisions "sweeping changes" in the way Americans 
learn science and mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
A report, "Science for All Americans," to be released <DATE>today</DATE> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, is 
the first phase of that effort. Prepared by the <ORGANIZATION>National Council on Science and 
Technology</ORGANIZATION>, which is sponsored by the science association, it lays out the kind 
of education Americans will need, at minimum, to live and work effectively in 
the <ORGANIZATION>21st Century</ORGANIZATION>. Three other recent reports have already highlighted the 
education deficit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Rated Lowest 
</P>
<P>
"A World of Differences" by the <ORGANIZATION>Educational Testing Service</ORGANIZATION> assessed 24,000 
13-year-olds in six nations. It showed <LOCATION>South Koreans</LOCATION> leading in math skills, 
followed in order by <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, with the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> 
trailing. A <ORGANIZATION>University of Michigan</ORGANIZATION> survey of first- and fifth-graders in 
<LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> found Americans doing significantly worse in math than 
Chinese students. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>National Research Council</ORGANIZATION>, representing the <ORGANIZATION>National Academies of Science 
and Engineering</ORGANIZATION>, assessed American math education and found it seriously 
wanting. Its "Everybody Counts" report warned starkly: "Wake up, <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>! Your 
children are at risk." 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>National Council on Science and Technology</ORGANIZATION> said, "It will take a shared 
national vision of what Americans want their schools to achieve" to remedy this 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
That is what this new report is all about. In it, the 26 members of the 
<ORGANIZATION>National Council</ORGANIZATION> recommend a common education core on which to base curriculums 
from kindergarten through high school. They start by defining their educational 
goal of scientific literacy. It includes: 
</P>
<P>
* "Being familiar with the natural world and recognizing both its diversity and 
its unity. 
</P>
<P>
* "Understanding key concepts and principles of science. 
</P>
<P>
* "Being aware of some of the important ways in which science, mathematics and 
technology depend upon one another. 
</P>
<P>
* "Knowing that science, mathematics and technology are human enterprises and 
knowing what that implies about their strengths and limitations. 
</P>
<P>
* "Having a capacity for scientific ways of thinking. 
</P>
<P>
* "Using scientific knowledge and ways of thinking for individual and social 
purposes." 
</P>
<P>
The council wants schools to teach old subjects in new ways that emphasize the 
connections rather than the boundaries between different areas of knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
"Transformations of energy, for example, occur in physical, biological and 
technological systems, and evolutionary change appears in stars, organisms and 
societies," the report notes. 
</P>
<P>
It says science education should emphasize ideas and thinking skills at the 
expense of specialized vocabulary and memorized procedures. This echoes the 
<ORGANIZATION>National Research Council</ORGANIZATION>'s views on math education. The <ORGANIZATION>National Research 
Council</ORGANIZATION> also gives priority to thinking skills and to grasping mathematical 
concepts that transcend computation, which is done mostly by machines. 
</P>
<P>
The new goal-defining report is the first phase of a long-term program called 
Project <DATE>2061</DATE>. That's the year <LOCATION>Halley</LOCATION>'s comet returns. The science association 
organized its <ORGANIZATION>National Council on Science and Technology</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1985</DATE>, when the 
comet last appeared, and named the program in its honor. 
</P>
<P>
The program's second phase will develop experimental curriculums in selected 
school districts over the next few years. Project director <PERSON>F. James Rutherford</PERSON> 
said that <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> districts have already 
agreed to participate. 
</P>
<P>
The final phase will be an effort extended over a decade or more to spread the 
new science and math education throughout the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>American Assn.</ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION>Advancement of Science</ORGANIZATION> is an umbrella group to which 
most American scientific and science education societies belong. Its 
geographically and professionally diverse membership is expected to help 
implement this program nationwide.

<TEXT>     "You could see the terror in peoples' eyes when you were teaching that
class," says <PERSON>Martin Hoffman</PERSON>, a remedial math instructor at <ORGANIZATION>Queens College</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. One of his students, a successful photographer, said he felt
physically sick whenever he drove past the college and was reminded how he had
flunked.;    "There's a lot of low self-esteem, even among math majors, about
mathematics," says <PERSON>JoAnne Growney</PERSON>, a mathematics professor at <ORGANIZATION>Bloomsburg
University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania.</LOCATION>;    Real mathematics is full of creative joy
that's often missing from the classroom, says <PERSON>Julian Weissglass</PERSON> of the
<ORGANIZATION>Mathematical Sciences Education Board</ORGANIZATION>. Instead, lessons emphasize "being able
to reproduce what someone else has done, rather than thinking for yourself. It
disables (students) as thinkers in our society.";    But it doesn't have to be
that way. In a small but growing number of classrooms, from kindergarten to
college, things are changing.;    Teachers lecture less and listen more. They
don't just demand answers; they ask students to explain their reasoning.;   
Students tackle problems in small groups rather than struggling alone. They
learn from each other and discover they're not stupid.;    In these
classrooms, people spend a lot of time writing about math. They keep journals
charting their feelings about the course, explain concepts in their own words,
even critique the text and examinations.;    They read about the lives of
mathematicians and explore the long-neglected connections between math and
poetry, art and music.;    They carry out independent projects: Describing the
aerodynamics of airplanes. Pondering the symmetry of an <PERSON>M.C. Escher</PERSON> print.
Analyzing <PERSON>Bach</PERSON>. Deciphering codes. Figuring the odds in gambling.;    The
problems they solve are firmly linked to everyday life. There are no timed
tests; after all, real mathematicians don't work on deadlines. Speed is less
important than understanding.;    This is math without lectures or
multiple-choice, and it's slowly edging into the mainstream -- where, in some
cases, it is turning student attitudes around.;    "I hated math. My math
classes were boring," said <PERSON>Misty Hernandez</PERSON>, a freshman enrolled in an
experimental math program at <ORGANIZATION>Silver Creek High School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>. "But in
this class, I started liking it. We work together -- we don't do everything
alone.";    "They teach you things you'll need in your life, like handling
money," said <PERSON>Joelda Mosqueda</PERSON>, also in the program. "It's fun.";    <ORGANIZATION>Silver
Creek</ORGANIZATION> is one of four <LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION> high schools in the new program,
coordinated by <ORGANIZATION>Lawrence Hall of Science</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>San Francisco State University.</LOCATION>;  
 In a typical day <DATE>last week</DATE>, students in <LOCATION>Barbara Huesca</LOCATION>'s freshman math class
met in groups of four to figure out probability problems. Then each group
presented its solution to the class.;    The last class exam asked students to
figure out which of two telephone companies offered the cheapest service, and
then to write a letter describing what they'd learned so far.;    It makes for
a noisy, active, sometimes contentious classroom, and it's just the kind of
learning that math reformers are after.;    Their efforts are being
coordinated by the <ORGANIZATION>Mathematical Sciences Education Board</ORGANIZATION>, part of the
prestigious <ORGANIZATION>National Research Council</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> Its <DATE>1989</DATE> report on
the future of math education stressed that students learn best when they work
in small groups, freely discussing and debating their ideas.;    Taking the
lead;    In <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> -- considered one of the leading states in math reform
-- the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Education</ORGANIZATION> has been pushing group learning since <DATE>1985</DATE>. Its
latest guidelines, now being drafted, recommend that students write about
mathematics and explain the thinking behind their solutions.;    These
guidelines are voluntary, and it's hard to determine how fast new ideas are
trickling into the classroom. In some schools, reform efforts are held up by a
lack of money to train teachers, said <PERSON>Joan Akers</PERSON>, a math consultant for the
state education department.;    And teachers at the leading edge of the reform
movement say they're sometimes frustrated. They meet with resistance from
colleagues, who prefer to teach as they were taught, and from students equally
uncomfortable with new approaches. But overall, they're enthused about
students' response.;    To nudge things along, the state is preparing a
powerful incentive in the form of new standardized tests.;    The changes
showed up three years ago in the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Assessment Program, or CAP, which
gauges the performance of the state's schools. For the first time, 12th
graders had to solve "open-ended" problems that require far more critical
thinking than calculation.;    CAP is now field-testing other alternatives to
the traditional multiple-choice, such as giving students problems to solve in
groups and evaluating portfolios of their work.;    Almost everyone agrees
that something has to change.;    Math is a gateway to careers in science and
engineering. Since women and minorities have traditionally done poorly in
mathematics, they have been excluded from those fields. Unless more students
are drawn into math, the country may suffer a critical shortage of scientists
and engineers in the next few decades.;    Math and science education in the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has been "disastrous," says <PERSON>Mary Beth Ruskai</PERSON>, a math professor
at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Lowell</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>. "What we have been doing has
simply not been working." The issue has become so important that President
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s proposed budget for <DATE>1992</DATE> includes a <PERCENT>37 percent</PERCENT> increase in funds for
math and science education.;    College-level reform;  <ORGANIZATION>California State
University</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Northridge</ORGANIZATION>, has been encouraging the no-lecture, group approach in
its remedial math program since <DATE>1978</DATE>. It now reaches 2,000 students per year.;
   "I think most people think mathematics is a static collection of data, with
no history and no future -- just a bunch of formulas you memorize," said <PERSON>Elena
Marchisotto</PERSON>, an associate professor of mathematics there. "Some people equate
mathematics with balancing your checkbook.";    But after taking these
classes, "Their attitude is different," she said. "It gives the students
confidence where they didn't have it. The evaluations are extremely high,
considering how much the students hate taking these courses.";    And at
<LOCATION>Charquin</LOCATION>, an alternative elementary school in <LOCATION>Hayward</LOCATION>, teacher <PERSON>Bob Whitlow</PERSON> has
been having students work in groups, write about mathematics and put together
portfolios for more than 15 years.;    "It's neat. The kids just really like
math," <PERSON>Whitlow</PERSON> said. "There's a big difference between math and arithmetic.
You'll never see a child sitting down, working out problem after problem, like
you and I did when we were in school."  </TEXT>

Ask any prominent American scientist or mathematician where he or she went to 
high school and you're likely to hear one of two places: <ORGANIZATION>Bronx High School of 
Science</ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION>Stuyvesant High School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Between them, these two <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> public high schools have graduated half a 
dozen Nobel Prize winners. In their more than 100 years of operation, they have 
by most measures educated more top-echelon scientists and mathematicians than 
any other schools in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, public or private. 
</P>
<P>
While these schools, with their innovative curricula and highly gifted 
students, have become a subject of enormous scrutiny and controversy in recent 
years because they systematically exclude the vast majority of students, there 
are many scientists and educators who extol high-powered specialty science high 
schools as one of the most important solutions to the nation's growing problems 
in science and math. 
</P>
<P>
Only by identifying "the best and the brightest students" in a city or region 
and giving them "heavy doses of science and math at an early age" can the 
nation hope "to avert a crisis in science and technology," argued Nobel 
laureate <PERSON>Glenn T. Seaborg</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Seaborg</PERSON>, the son of poor, Swedish immigrants, began his scientific education at 
<PERSON>David Starr Jordan</PERSON> High School in <LOCATION>Watts</LOCATION> in the <DATE>1920s</DATE>. He managed to rise above 
his humble educational beginnings to go on to be a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Manhattan 
Project</ORGANIZATION>, chancellor of UC <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Atomic Energy 
Commission</ORGANIZATION> and winner of the <DATE>1940</DATE> Nobel Prize in chemistry for the discovery of 
plutonium. But his early schooling was not, he said, "the sort of beginning 
anyone can count on to produce a scientist or mathematician." 
</P>
<P>
Believing as <PERSON>Seaborg</PERSON> does that highly competitive specialty schools may be 
among the best and most reliable places to produce world-class researchers and 
inventors, many states over the last decade have been creating new schools 
modeled after <ORGANIZATION>Stuyvesant</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Bronx Science</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>1980</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics</ORGANIZATION>, the country's 
first public boarding school, opened in <LOCATION>Durham</LOCATION>. In <DATE>1982</DATE>, another public 
boarding school, the <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> School for Math, Science and the Arts, opened in 
<LOCATION>Natchitoches</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>La</LOCATION>. In <DATE>1985</DATE>, a regional public day school, the <PERSON>Thomas Jefferson 
High School</PERSON>, a Governor's <ORGANIZATION>School for Science and Technology</ORGANIZATION>, opened in 
<LOCATION>Alexandria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION> on the outskirts of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. In <DATE>1986</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Illinois 
Mathematics and Science Academy</ORGANIZATION> began operations in <LOCATION>Auroa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, outside 
<LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the <ORGANIZATION>South Carolina Governor's School for Science</ORGANIZATION> and Mathematics 
was created in <LOCATION>Hartsville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION>Mississippi School for Mathematics and 
Science</ORGANIZATION> started in <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Miss</LOCATION>. Just this <DATE>fall</DATE>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> opened its first 
public, competitive science and math high school, the <ORGANIZATION>California Academy of 
Mathematics and Science</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Cal State Dominguez Hills</ORGANIZATION>, near <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"These schools do not represent what's going on in the rest of the country, but 
they do represent our best hope for the future," said <PERSON>E. G. Sherburne Jr.</PERSON>, 
publisher of <ORGANIZATION>Science News</ORGANIZATION> magazine and president of <ORGANIZATION>Science Service Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which 
administers the <ORGANIZATION>Westinghouse Science Talent Search</ORGANIZATION>, a prestigious nationwide 
competition for teen-age students of science. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason these schools work is quite simple," said <PERSON>Abe Baumel</PERSON>, who has been 
principal of Stuyvesant for more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
And despite what most people think, it has nothing to do with the 
qualifications of teachers or the quality of equipment or even the design of 
the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at this place," <PERSON>Baumel</PERSON> said. "The building is as old and broken down as I 
am. We have one chemistry lab and one physics lab, and they are both in 
abominable shape. The equipment is older than I am -- and in worse shape. The 
oak tables date back to <DATE>1904</DATE>. The machine tools are so obsolete, they belong in 
the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian</ORGANIZATION>." 
</P>
<P>
The key to the success of a school is simply a matter of the quality of the 
student body. 
</P>

"It's the kids," <PERSON>Baumel</PERSON> said. "They're incredible. . . . There is a joke that 
it's harder to get in here than it is to get into <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION>. But it's no joke. 
</P>
<P>
"When you bring a group of these kids together, when you get a critical mass of 
them in one place, magic starts to happen." 
</P>
<P>
While not wanting to dilute this magic in any way, many of the specialty 
schools -- old as well as new -- are trying to reach out to students who might 
not ordinarily be expected to excel in science and math. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Bronx Science</ORGANIZATION>, for example, has begun a special admissions programs for 
disadvantaged students and <DATE>summer</DATE> classes for students in regular public high 
schools who are interested in science and math, but who do not score high 
enough on entrance exams to be admitted to the regular academic program. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON> has been trying to devise entirely new admissions criteria 
that emphasize motivation and grades rather than scores on standardized 
admissions tests. And the <ORGANIZATION>California Academy of Mathematics and Science</ORGANIZATION> has 
insisted on recruiting its first class not just from the top <PERCENT>1%</PERCENT> or <PERCENT>2%</PERCENT> of the 
student population but from the top <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT>, drawing no more than two or three from 
each of 60 feeder schools in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>South Bay</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that nearly <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT> of the 116 entering freshmen are members of 
under-represented minority groups -- blacks, Latinos, <LOCATION>Cambodians</LOCATION>, Vietnamese -- 
and over half are female. 
</P>
<P>
Most specialty schools have been able to get as many as <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> of their graduates 
to pursue scientific careers, said <PERSON>Kathy Clark</PERSON>, principal of the new academy. 
"If we get anywhere close to that and yet serve the kind of population we are 
serving, surely we will have proved something very important."

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Bookshelf:
Princeton's Wise Men

By Raymond Sokolov</HL>
<DD> 09/22/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   In <DATE>1931</DATE>, foes of "Jewish physics" in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> published an anti-relativistic tract called "100 Authors Against Einstein." 
The book was intellectually laughable but the rising tide of Nazism it helped to swell was not. 
Like many other German Jews alert to their growing danger at home, <PERSON>Albert Einstein</PERSON> emigrated to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, landing, relatively speaking, on his feet, as one of the first four faculty members at a remarkable new academic center. 
<PERSON>Kurt Godel</PERSON>, the second smartest man in the world, was also there from the start. 
And before long this paradise of the mind would welcome <PERSON>John von Neumann</PERSON>, father of the modern computer, perhaps the most cerebrally dazzling and influential thinker of the century. 

   In "Who Got <ORGANIZATION>Einstein's Office</ORGANIZATION>? 
Eccentricity and Genius at the Institute for Advanced Study" (Addison-Wesley, 316 pages, <MONEY>$17.95</MONEY>), <PERSON>Ed Regis</PERSON> tells the story of <LOCATION>Princeton</LOCATION>'s illustrious enclave, from those early days of glamour and achievement to the problematic present. 

   It all started because <PERSON>Louis Bamberger</PERSON> and his sister <PERSON>Caroline Bamberger Fuld</PERSON> sold their <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> department store to <ORGANIZATION>Macy</ORGANIZATION>'s for <MONEY>$25 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1929</DATE> six weeks before the Crash. 
Among the philanthropies they planned was a <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> medical school that would favor Jewish applicants. 
Pursuing this aim, they consulted <PERSON>Abraham Flexner</PERSON>, an academic muckraker and visionary, who transmuted the populist medical school into an elitist avatar of the <ORGANIZATION>Platonic Academy</ORGANIZATION>. 
Here the greatest minds on the planet would come to think. 

   They also did manage to affect the outside world, as an emblem of disinterested intellection and through practical achievement. 
Von <PERSON>Neumann</PERSON> even did physical experiments on the premises, despite strong objections from many quarters in the institute, perfecting computer architecture and writing some of the first computer software, directly in treacherous machine language. 
The machine worked right away and its shakedown test was the largest computation ever done until that time, over a billion arithmetic and logical operations to predict whether the untested hydrogen bomb would explode. 

   As von <PERSON>Neumann</PERSON>'s collaborator <PERSON>Julian Bigelow</PERSON> recalled it for <PERSON>Mr. Regis</PERSON>: "It was computed in the <DATE>summer of 1950</DATE> by <PERSON>Marshall Rosenbluth</PERSON>, while the machine had clip leads on it. 
We had engineers there to keep it running and it ran for 60 days, day and night, with very few errors. 
It did a nice job. 
And it was a very historic computation." 

   The research was atypical for the institute (the computer lab was dismantled after von <PERSON>Neumann</PERSON>'s death), but <PERSON>Mr. Regis</PERSON>'s treatment of the episode is typical of his method. 
He is a science journalist (for OMNI) and a philosopher on the faculty at <ORGANIZATION>Howard University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. 
So he characteristically makes his way through his often technical story with plenty of anecdotes in hand. 
But he does not skirt the hard parts of his material, explaining them as clearly as he can to a nonmathematical audience and always worrying at their moral or philosophical significance. 

   If you want to get an idea of the birth of the computer or a glimpse of one of its flashier mathematical applications (those self-proliferating graphic patterns produced by institute alumnus <PERSON>Benoit Mandelstam</PERSON>'s fractal algorithms), <PERSON>Mr. Regis</PERSON> is as good a teacher as you will find. 
He even includes some simple fractal programs you can try out on your Mac and watch them change and grow. 
<PERSON>Mr. Regis</PERSON> also can make the most austere institute scholars come through as more than just brains. 
He gives you <PERSON>Einstein</PERSON> pathetically following a blind alley for his whole career in <LOCATION>Princeton</LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Godel</ORGANIZATION> starving himself to death in guilty fear that his famous theorem, which radically altered mathematics, was mistaken and that he had not achieved enough. 

   In the most entertaining way, <PERSON>Mr. Regis</PERSON> gives you a taste of the hardest science there is, but he is not just using the institute as a convenient armature for organizing an overview of recent physics and math. 
He really has written a serious institutional history in which the politics, external and internal, of <PERSON>J. Robert Oppenheimer</PERSON>'s tenure as institute director and the overarching issue of the institute's purpose and place in the world are gracefully, fairly considered. 

   The Oppenheimer case has been much discussed -- his charisma as director of the <LOCATION>Los Alamos</LOCATION> project, his subsequent public disgrace as a security risk. 
<PERSON>Mr. Regis</PERSON> says simply: "It was <ORGANIZATION>Oppenheimer</ORGANIZATION>'s mental quickness, combined with a selective liberty with truth, that led to his well-publicized downfall." 
But he also shows how <ORGANIZATION>Oppenheimer</ORGANIZATION>'s grandstanding arrogance at a congressional hearing in <DATE>1949</DATE> humiliated <PERSON>Lewis Strauss</PERSON>, who as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Atomic Energy Commission</ORGANIZATION> arranged to have <ORGANIZATION>Oppenheimer</ORGANIZATION>'s office at the institute wiretapped and later had the man's head. 
<PERSON>Mr. Regis</PERSON> summarizes the <ORGANIZATION>Oppenheimer</ORGANIZATION> literature in a page or two, ending with the letter supporting <ORGANIZATION>Oppenheimer</ORGANIZATION>'s continuing tenure as institute director, signed by some of the institute's faculty: <LOCATION>Einstein</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Godel</LOCATION>, von <PERSON>Neumann</PERSON>. 

   Clearly, <PERSON>Mr. Regis</PERSON> thinks the institute's greatest days are over, that its lingering emphasis on theory is a limitation and that it now does a better job as a temporary haven for postdoctoral fellows than it does as a lifelong hidey-hole for world-class sages. 
But <PERSON>Mr. Regis</PERSON> still feels the tug of the place and the thrill of its brilliant denizens, who must have sensed his own intelligence and sympathy for them. 
They talked to him freely, and he has let the rest of us eavesdrop at a polite distance.

Golden <LOCATION>West College</LOCATION> has captured its second grant this year from the <ORGANIZATION>National 
Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, bringing to <MONEY>$94,000</MONEY> the foundation's awards to strengthen 
the mathematics department and the teaching of calculus, college officials said 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>NSF</ORGANIZATION> last month approved <MONEY>$36,000</MONEY> for a pilot project at the college aimed at 
developing computer programs to simulate complex mathematical concepts that can 
be difficult for students to conceptualize, <ORGANIZATION>Golden West</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Lori Thomas</PERSON> 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The mathematics department was awarded a <MONEY>$58,000</MONEY> matching grant in <DATE>May</DATE> to buy 
computer software that will aid calculus and pre-calculus students in the 
classroom. Golden West's grants adviser <PERSON>Kathryn A. Crown</PERSON> said she has raised 
<MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> in matching funds from the <ORGANIZATION>Educational Foundation of America</ORGANIZATION>. She is 
seeking another <MONEY>$45,000</MONEY> in private grants to match the <ORGANIZATION>NSF</ORGANIZATION> award. 
</P>
<P>
Crown said it is rare for a community college to get any grants from the 
prestigious science agency and that it is a measure of the increasing national 
emphasis on early and higher quality science and mathematics instruction. 
</P>
<P>
"To get two <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION> grants is a rather extraordinary 
event," <PERSON>Crown</PERSON> said. "Before, unless we had a nationally known instructor here, 
we wouldn't have been considered." 
</P>
<P>
But with fewer American students entering the science and mathematics fields, 
especially teachers who can produce the next generation of scientists and 
mathematicians, agencies such as the <ORGANIZATION>NSF</ORGANIZATION> are putting their funds behind 
programs aimed at increasing the pool of potential science majors. 
</P>
<P>
"(<ORGANIZATION>NSF</ORGANIZATION> officials) are beginning to realize that the majority of college students 
start in community colleges," <PERSON>Crown</PERSON> said. "Generally, the emphasis has been at 
the other end of the spectrum, in graduate research. Now, the emphasis is on 
getting qualified people to go into the sciences." 
</P>
<P>
The latest grant project to receive <ORGANIZATION>NSF</ORGANIZATION> funding goes to a team headed by Golden 
West mathematics professor <PERSON>David Horowitz</PERSON>. The team's goal is to use computer 
simulation to deal with such abstract concepts as linear equations and harmonic 
motions. 
</P>
<P>
The earlier grant goes to a team led by mathematics professor <PERSON>Jack Wadhams</PERSON>, who 
said the goal is to better prepare calculus students for mathematics and 
science courses at four-year colleges. <PERSON>KRISTINA LINDGREN</PERSON>

   Sen. <PERSON>Edward Kennedy</PERSON> turned actor <DATE>Monday</DATE>,
portraying a <ORGANIZATION>Harvard Square</ORGANIZATION> train station in an algebra lesson that
helped turn a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Senate</ORGANIZATION> hearing into a lively variety show for
300 children.
   The young audience also met 4-foot robot, a <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> scientist
who showed them a telescope that can be made for less than <MONEY>$1</MONEY> and a
fifth-grade teacher who borrowed a real dinosaur skull for a
make-believe trip to the Western desert to study paleontology.
   The setting was a hearing to take testimony for a <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> bill
aimed at boosting education in math, science and technology.
   In a departure from the customary decorous exchange of testimony
and questions, the hearing was held in a theater at the <ORGANIZATION>Museum of
Science</ORGANIZATION> and included middle school youngsters from the <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> area.
Teachers with novel methods and program instructors deploying high
technology showed how they inspire enthusiasm among children in
science and math.
   The need for enthusiasm is dire.
   According to figures gathered by the <ORGANIZATION>Labor and Human Resources
Committee</ORGANIZATION> about the 24,000 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> high schools, 7,000 offer no
physics course; 4,000 offer no chemistry and 2,000 offer not a
single biology course.
   Among the nation's elementary and high school science teachers a
full 60,000 are unqualified to teach that subject.
   Half the faculty jobs in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> graduate schools of engineering
are held by foreigners because of a dearth of American engineering
teachers.
   Yet it is projected that by the year <DATE>2006</DATE>, <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> will be short
675,000 scientists and engineers, and by <DATE>2000</DATE> industry will be
short 2 million technicians.
   Just 10 years from now the country will need 300,000 more
science teachers.
   Kennedy and <PERSON>Sen. Mark Hatfield</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Utah</LOCATION>, are cosponsors of the
Excellence in Math, Science and Engineering Education Act, which is
now before <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy's Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee</ORGANIZATION>.
   The bill sets out a 10-year schedule of appropriations, starting
with <MONEY>$125 million</MONEY> for improving and monitoring science and math
education. It would direct more attention as well to technological
training in industry and to bringing more women and minorities into
the field.
   The Labor committee is expected to vote on the bill soon and, if
it passes muster, send it to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> floor this <DATE>summer</DATE>.
   Among the presentations at the hearing was the algebra lesson
invented by <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> teacher <PERSON>Robert Moses</PERSON>. It translates the
abstractions of A plus B equals C into reality.
   Moses enlisted <LOCATION>Kennedy</LOCATION> along with nine students to stand in
front of the auditorium to represent train stops on the Red Line
subway route connecting <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>.
   Three children played the train, chug-chugging between the
stations. Such lessons, conducted over time and interspersed with
trips on real trains, are used to teach children the concept that a
variable like ``x'' or ``y'' can, in algebra, stand for a real
number. The also help relate math to real life.
   The problem may go even deeper than the need to make math and
science more relevant, however.
   <PERSON>Jane Holdsworth</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>The Thames Science Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New London</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, told <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON> that while wheeling in her robot to make her
presentation, a little girl asked her if the robot bites.
   ``I hope we're getting to the day when we know that robots don't
bite,'' <PERSON>Holdsworth</PERSON> said. ``And that math and science don't bite.
They're fun.''

JACK SMITH: DEMOLISHING DECONSTRUCTION BRINGS MORE DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I continue to be chastised for questioning the validity and value of a vogue 
form of literary criticism known as deconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
I do not understand deconstruction, as I admitted; but I infer, from what I 
have read, that it reduces texts to ambiguity or meaninglessness. In the end, 
the word is master of the man. 
</P>
<P>
It was born in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, but now seems to be entrenched in American higher 
education, especially at UC <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Occidental College</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
I have already quoted <PERSON>John Rowe</PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION>Critical Theory Institute</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION>, 
who complained that as a journalist I am no more able to understand 
deconstruction than to understand atomic physics or perform laser surgery. 
Quite correct. 
</P>
<P>
Similar complaints, though more acerbic, have come from <PERSON>Michael R. Near</PERSON>, 
assistant professor of English, and <PERSON>Daniel D. Fineman</PERSON>, associate professor of 
English and comparative literary studies, both of <ORGANIZATION>Occidental</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Having had my say, I owe my critics a hearing. I hope my necessarily brief 
summaries reflect fairly the tone and content of their protests. 
</P>
<P>
Near's is long and detailed. First, he says that my ignorance makes it hard to 
take me seriously. But he notes that I would not scorn an astrophysicist 
because he could not explain his work to me in a few simple words. "I am 
therefore curious that you would feel no compunction about leveling your scorn 
at language specialists who could not reduce to a few simple terms the 
intricacies of deconstruction." 
</P>
<P>
He said my column was "childish, intellectually irresponsible, and 
ideologically dangerous," and perpetuated "the long anti-intellectual tradition 
that values the obvious and eschews the difficult enterprise of critical 
thinking. . . . And you do it in such an engaging style that we can barely 
detect the ideological rot that serves as the foundation for your discussion. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
(That's not as bad as comparing me to <PERSON>Hitler</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Stalin</ORGANIZATION>, as another critic 
did.) 
</P>
<P>
Prof. <PERSON>Fineman</PERSON>, like Near and <PERSON>Rowe</PERSON>, said that I simply do not have the education 
to understand deconstruction. He notes that he has spent 15 years trying to 
read <PERSON>Jacques Derrida</PERSON>, its high priest. "His work is very difficult because it 
relies on an in-depth knowledge of Western philosophy from <LOCATION>Parmenides</LOCATION> to 
<PERSON>Husserl</PERSON>, a set of theoretical gambits that are at odds with those implicit in 
this same Western culture, a use of language that is intentionally metaphoric, 
and no desire to lower his rhetorical or discursive 'level' to please an 
audience which has not done its 'homework.' " 
</P>
<P>
As if that were not enough to shut me out, he notes that deconstruction can be 
thought of as "a humanistic replication of <PERSON>Kurt Godel</PERSON>'s Incompleteness Theorem 
of <DATE>1931</DATE>." (I admit I am not familiar with that theorem.) 
</P>
<P>
"Now <PERSON>Godel</PERSON> was one of the great mathematicians of the <ORGANIZATION>20th Century</ORGANIZATION>, and his 
work in foundations and meta-mathematics is universally respected by those who 
can understand it. Nonetheless, I suspect that if you 'knock at (his) door,' 
you will also find no one who speaks your particularly impoverished version of 
English." 
</P>
<P>
I admit my ignorance. I am even more ignorant than the person who wrote the 
following plaintive letter, asking to remain anonymous: 
</P>
<P>
"Your essay was a shot in the arm. I am a candidate for an <ORGANIZATION>M.A.</ORGANIZATION> in English. For 
several years now, I have been struggling to understand deconstruction. As of 
today, I still haven't a clue as to what it is about. I have been made to feel 
inadequate by certain . . . professors because I wasn't able to gush over this 
new phenomenon or use its jargon. . . . I am a humble high school English 
teacher. The flatulent, self-conscious and pompous deconstruction essays are 
the very antithesis of what I have been teaching my students about writing. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
And this one, also anonymous, from a graduate student in the humanities at <ORGANIZATION>UCI</ORGANIZATION>, 
where Derrida is in residence: 
</P>
<P>
"As a rule, the faculty worships the ground (<LOCATION>Derrida</LOCATION>) walks on. Your article . 
. . only expresses the tip of the iceberg. The real tragedy is the salaries, 
perks, grad student favors, secretarial help and free conference time that 
these tenured 'researchers' receive while 27 million Americans are illiterate. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
Have the deconstructionists improved the writing of one novelist or poet, or 
made literature any more readable? Does anyone outside the rarefied air of 
their ivory towers have the slightest idea what they're talking about? 
</P>
<P>
True, I don't understand the physicists either, but at least they gave us the 
atom bomb.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Ofsted criticises maths and science teaching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mathematics and science teaching in the schools of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION> are
'not as strong as they should be', says a report published yesterday by
<ORGANIZATION>Ofsted</ORGANIZATION>, the education watchdog.
The popularity of science subjects among A-level pupils has declined and
'there is no room for complacency over the supply of well-qualified young
adults for employment in engineering or science-related fields', it says.
The proportion of those studying for science and mathematics A-levels only
has fallen from 27.6 per cent in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE> to 16.7 per cent this year.
According to the <ORGANIZATION>Joint Mathematical Council</ORGANIZATION> this means that the proportion
of the age group potentially qualified to study a science subject or
engineering at university has fallen 40 per cent over the decade.
Two-thirds of those studying science A-levels are doing so in combination
with non-science subjects. The report says they are increasingly likely to
choose accountancy, law or business studies courses in higher education,
rather than science or engineering.
A fall in the number of school-leavers is partly to blame, it adds.
The proportion of all 18-year-olds taking science A-levels rose slightly
over the <DATE>last decade</DATE>, with the proportion taking maths A-level rising from
<MONEY>6.5 per cent</MONEY> in <DATE>1983</DATE> to 7.7 per cent in <DATE>1993</DATE>.
But over the same period, the proportion attempting A-levels in English rose
from 5.9 to 14.4 per cent. <ORGANIZATION>Ofsted</ORGANIZATION> said teaching of mathematics for children
aged seven to 11, and of science for those from 11 to 14, needed to be
improved.
The narrowness of the three-subject A-level curriculum in the sixth form
meant that most primary teachers did not have mathematics qualifications
beyond GCSE, the level normally attained by the age of 16.
As a result there was a problem with teachers' confidence in mathematics.
Many had 'little theoretical understanding' about how progress in learning
numbers occurs. In-service teacher-training should be expanded to meet this
problem, the inspectors say.
<PERSON>Mr Mike Tomlinson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Ofsted</ORGANIZATION>'s director of inspection, said an expansion in
spending on better teaching facilities, which last saw heavy investment in
<DATE>1988</DATE> during the introduction of GCSE exams, might persuade more scientists
to become teachers. He suggested this could be as much as Pounds 100m.
Vandalism, theft and malicious fire cost schools in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wales Pounds</LOCATION>
49m in the 1992-93 financial year, the <ORGANIZATION>Department for Education</ORGANIZATION> said
yesterday.
This represented a fall of 32 per cent from the costs created by crime the
previous year, but insurance costs were estimated to have increased by 38
per cent to more than Pounds 66m - or about Pounds 3,000 per school.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Arts: A Ripping drama - Malcolm Rutherford reviews a
promising playwright
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KAREN HOPE'S new play opens with such a burst or repetitive swearing that it
seems like a throwback to the <DATE>1980s</DATE>. That may be an act of deliberate
symbolism, for suddenly a character enters declaring that there are enough
words in the English language to make swearing unnecessary. Then the effing
more or less stops and we may have entered new ground.
Ripping is a cerebral play, full of ambiguities, but it is not
clever-clever. It does not draw on <PERSON>Harold Pinter</PERSON>, nor anyone else who
immediately comes to mind. Like all good plays, it is physical as well as
verbal. It is also almost frighteningly sane.
It stems from a good idea, not far away from facts. Ripping makes an analogy
between mind-building and body-building. A child prodigy goes up to
<LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION> to read advancedmathematics. She is so young that she has to be
accompanied by her father whose maths she is rapidly outstripping.
The pair of them lodge in a place where there is a not dissimilar menage. A
rather older girl has been a champion swimmer: some of her records are still
unbeaten. In her twenties she has moved onto body-building with a coach who
is also her lover.
The play revolves around the interchanges between these two couples. <PERSON>Tom
Stoppard</PERSON>, who has toyed with mathematics and the sciences in <LOCATION>Arcadia</LOCATION>, ought
to look to his laurels. For Ripping is also about the application of maths
to biology and the other way round, and it is very convincingly done. The
young mathematician is fascinated by the development of the older girl's
muscles and physical movements. The body-builder coach is a scientist of a
kind as well: he has learned a lot from studying mushrooms.
But this is not an abstract piece. The play works on a level of almost total
realism. The dialogue is in the vernacular, loud music occasionally
interspersing the talk. Apart from the mind and body-building analogy, there
is a sub-theme. Both girls have been pushed into their ambitious positions
by their respective fathers. Laura, the mathematician played by <PERSON>Lindsey
Wilson</PERSON>, has her father still around and fussing. Melanie, the athlete, was
encouraged to take body-building drugs by a father now absent but who still
turns up at her contests.
Only four characters appear in the play: the two girls, <PERSON>Laura</PERSON>'s father and
<PERSON>Melanie</PERSON>'s coach. All become entangled with each other, though how far is
left ambiguous. The one possible character weakness in the writing is
<PERSON>Anthony</PERSON>, the father of <LOCATION>Laura</LOCATION>. It is not clear how much he responds, or wants
to, to <PERSON>Melanie</PERSON>'s sexual advances, nor whether he remotely understands the
maths in which he is driving his daughter.
For the rest, however, this is a remarkably vibrant play, beautifully done
and precisely directed by <PERSON>Jessica Dromgoole</PERSON>. The Cockpit is a good place to
do it because the theatre in the round is exactly right for the various
contests. (The <ORGANIZATION>National</ORGANIZATION>'s Cottesloe Theatre would be another.) As <PERSON>Melanie</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Victoria Harwood</PERSON> looks at times like a graceful female Atlas, and can then
movingly crack up.
The ultimate tribute is to Ms Hope whose Foreign Lands was performed at the
Finborough early this year. If she goes on like this, we may have a
playwright for the <DATE>1990s</DATE> after all.
The Cockpit, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> NW8 until <DATE>October 30</DATE>. (071) 402 5081
