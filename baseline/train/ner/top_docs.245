   Pictures taken by the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft
suggest that volcanoes still spew Australia-sized lava floods on
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, and the planet didn't abruptly shut down after a
global-sized eruption 400 million years ago.
   ``Venus is not dead,'' <ORGANIZATION>Southern Methodist University</ORGANIZATION> scientist
<PERSON>Roger Phillips</PERSON> said <DATE>Monday</DATE> during the <ORGANIZATION>American Geophysical Union</ORGANIZATION>'s
fall meeting.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> hasn't yet found direct proof that volcanoes are
erupting today on the planet, but ``it seems likely Venus is still
(volcanically) active today,'' said <PERSON>Steve Saunders</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s
chief scientist at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>.
   The spacecraft's latest radar pictures of cloud-covered <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>
show there are absolutely no meteorite impact craters in an
Australia-sized portion of the planet's Sappho region, just north
of the Venusian equator, <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> said.
   That means the huge area is covered by lava that was deposited
in a massive flood-like eruption sometime within the last tens of
millions of years - very young in geological terms, <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> said.
   ``It raises the likelihood Venus is still active,'' the <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>
researcher added.
   Venus ``has to be volcanically active, but demonstrating it is
going to be hard,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Brown University</ORGANIZATION> geologist <PERSON>Jim Head</PERSON>, a
member of the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> science team.
   To show conclusively that volcanoes now erupt on <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
must fly over the same parts of the planet twice and look for
differences caused by active lava flows. That won't happen until
next <DATE>spring</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said last month that most of the meteorite impact
craters on Venus appeared relatively young and fresh. He said that
suggested older impact craters were obliterated by gargantuan
floods of lava.
   At the time, <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said that either lava gushed from numerous
cracks in the surface to flood <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of Venus during a single
catastrophe about 400 million years ago, or that a series of
somewhat smaller but still giant lava floods inundate various
regions of Venus during different times.
   The evidence <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> presented <DATE>Monday</DATE> supports the second
theory.
   If a single global lava flood created most of Venus' lowland
plains 400 million years ago, meteorite impact craters should
appear across much of the planet's landscape. But the pictures
showing the uncratered region of Sappho suggest that huge, but not
global, lava floods occur on different parts of the planet at
different times, <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> said.
   That, in turn, indicates massive volcanic flooding is an ongoing
process of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, the second planet from the sun.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was launched from space shuttle Atlantis in <DATE>May 1989</DATE>,
went into orbit around <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE> and formally started making
maps and pictures of the planet on <DATE>Sept. 15</DATE>.
   As of <DATE>Monday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> had orbited Venus 847 times, bouncing
radar off <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s surface to make maps and pictures during more
than 450 of the orbits, said <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> experiment representative
<PERSON>Steve Wall</PERSON>.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers reported <DATE>Monday</DATE> that <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was unable to map
Venus during 3{ orbits of the planet <DATE>Saturday</DATE> and obtained only
poor-quality pictures during two other orbits.
   A device that locates stars to help point <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> picked the
wrong star because of electronic static. That meant the
spacecraft's main antenna was unable to point properly and collect
radar echoes used to make pictures. Engineers fixed the problem
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> by sending new computer commands to <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>.

   The <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft found evidence that
volcanoes may be erupting to this day on <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and that they gushed
an Australia-sized flood of lava in recent geological times.

   The <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft has found
evidence that ocean-sized floods of molten rock once inundated more
than half the surface of Venus.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> scientists said they don't yet know if there was one great
outpouring of lava from cracks in <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> or a series of smaller
flows, each hundreds of thousands of square miles, that engulfed
parts of Venus at different times.
   The scientists at the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
reported the findings <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> uses radar to make pictures of cloud-covered <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>. The
spacecraft was launched from space shuttle Atlantis in <DATE>May 1989</DATE>,
went into orbit around <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE> and formally began making
maps and pictures of the planet on <DATE>Sept. 15</DATE>.
   Geologist <PERSON>Steve Saunders</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s chief scientist, said he
favors the view that the lava gushed out of cracks called vents in
a global set of eruptions that happened all at once, maybe 400
million years ago.
   <ORGANIZATION>Brown University</ORGANIZATION> geologist and <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> scientist <PERSON>Jim Head</PERSON> said,
however, the evidence is incomplete.
   ``There's no question that the vast majority of the surface of
Venus has been formed by lava flows and volcanic activity,'' he
said. ``But the question is, did it all happen catastrophically?''
   The lava covers roughly <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of the planet, according to
<PERSON>Saunders</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said he began to suspect <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> was subject to such
catastrophic volcanic activity because <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s pictures of Venus
show the planet has fewer large meteorite impact craters than
<ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s moon, and because ``the ones we find are all relatively
fresh.''
   That suggests ``there's a process of very widespread volcanism
that occurs from time to time that destroys all the craters - and
everything else,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' widespread lava flooding was similar to,
but much larger than, vast lava deposits such as <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s Deccan
Traps and the <LOCATION>Pacific Northwest</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Columbia River</LOCATION> basalts.
   The Deccan lava floods happened when <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s crust split open as
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION> drifted away from <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> about 66 million years ago, allowing
huge volumes of molten rock to pour onto the landscape.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Columbia River</ORGANIZATION> basalts, which formed in massive eruptions
roughly 12 million to 20 million years ago, cover much of the
<LOCATION>Pacific Northwest</LOCATION> east of the <ORGANIZATION>Cascade Range</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY> map-making mission was suspended <DATE>Oct. 26</DATE>
because the sun is lined up almost directly between <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and the
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, impairing communications between controllers and the
spacecraft. The suspension also was meant to allow engineers time
to fix <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s wobbling solar power panels.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> hopes to resume mapping <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> scientists who bounced radio waves
off cloud-shrouded Venus detected huge blobs that may be lava flows
and rings that may be volcanic crater rims, both very bright and
possibly rich in fool's gold, a new study says.
   The study provides more evidence that <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' volcanoes erupted
within the last few million years and possibly within recent
centuries, said researchers from the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Their findings appear in <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s issue of the journal Science,
coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the launch of the Pioneer
Venus orbiter, a spacecraft that still circles the second planet
from the sun.
   JPL radar scientists <PERSON>Ray Jurgens</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Martin Slade</ORGANIZATION> and geologist
<PERSON>R. Stephen Saunders</PERSON> transmitted radio waves from <LOCATION>Goldstone</LOCATION> to
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' equatorial region. Half the waves bounced back to three
210-foot-diameter, dish-shaped antennas at the Mojave Desert
facility.
   The fuzzy radar pictures revealed bright, or highly reflective,
rings of material on the surface, as well as bright blobs.
   The largest blob, measuring 350 miles long and 180 miles wide,
apparently is a large lava flow and has a large mound, possibly a
volcano, at its west end, <PERSON>Jurgens</PERSON> said.
   The largest ring is roughly 60 miles across and appears to be
the rim of a crater caused by a meteorite impact. But other rings
about 18 miles across may be rims of large volcanic craters called
calderas, he said.
   The researchers speculate the blobs and rings are so highly
reflective to radar because the lava flows and crater rims are rich
in iron pyrite or other metallic minerals blasted to the surface of
the planet by volcanic eruptions or meteorite impacts. Iron pyrite
is known as fool's gold because it looks like gold.
   Because fool's gold or other metallic minerals should decompose
and lose their reflectivity over time, the discovery ``certainly is
evidence of relatively recent volcanism,'' since old craters lack
bright rings, <PERSON>Jurgens</PERSON> said.
   It isn't possible to say whether ``recent'' means within the
last few million years or last few centuries because researchers
don't know how quickly rocks break down on Venus, said <PERSON>Jurgens</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Saunders</PERSON>, who is project scientist for the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan Venus Radar
Mapper</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft, set for launch next <DATE>April</DATE>.
   Radar readings from <ORGANIZATION>Pioneer</ORGANIZATION> suggested volcanoes existed on
Venus. Previous radar pictures made from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and by Soviet
spacecraft in <DATE>1983</DATE> revealed lava flows, volcanic craters and
craters from meteorite impacts.
   But researchers don't know if volcanoes still are active on the
planet, which is covered by thick, acid-laden carbon dioxide clouds
that prevent direct observation by telescopes.
   In <DATE>1984</DATE>, scientists announced that Pioneer detected lightning
bolts and a 50-fold increase in sulfur dioxide concentrations in
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' atmosphere after <DATE>1978</DATE>. Because lightning and sulfur dioxide
can be caused by eruptions, the discoveries suggested a gargantuan
volcano may have erupted shortly before <DATE>1978</DATE>.
   Other studies also found highly reflective features on <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>'
mountains, but scientists debated whether the brightness was from
volcanic metallic minerals or simply artificial brightness created
by rough landscape.
   The blobs and rings found by the <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> study are the first highly
reflective features discovered on Venusian lowlands, and thus
support the theory that the brightness is caused by metallic
minerals, <PERSON>Jurgens</PERSON> said.
   ``It's a good working hypothesis to say these (blobs) are young
lava flows,'' but the radar images aren't good enough to determine
which rings are volcanic craters and which are impact craters, said
<PERSON>Harold Masursky</PERSON>, a planetary geologist with the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological
Survey</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Flagstaff</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz</LOCATION>.
   ``We'll settle this argument with <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>,'' which is scheduled
to reach Venus in <DATE>August 1990</DATE> and map most of the planet using
radar, he said.
   ``Some of the big volcanoes on Venus may still be active, which
would be ... interesting,'' <PERSON>Masursky</PERSON> said. ``The only other places
we have ongoing volcanism are the Earth and (<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s moon) Io.''

FLYTRAPS CAPTURE BUGS AND MORE -- STUDENTS' ATTENTION

Questions erupted the moment <PERSON>Teri Uyemura</PERSON>'s sixth-graders opened their science 
books <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> and saw the color photo of a Venus' flytrap devouring a 
housefly. 
</P>
<P>
"How does it kill the fly?" 
</P>
<P>
"Will it bite my finger off too?" 
</P>
<P>
"Does the bug ever escape?" 
</P>
<P>
While the accompanying essay, "Insect eaters of the plant world," did its best 
to explain the phenomenon, Uyemura looked around her class and saw more than a 
few doubters. 
</P>
<P>
What would really drive her science lesson home, Uyemura thought, was a live 
demonstration of how bladderworts, pitcher plants, sundews or the exotic <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' 
flytraps actually captured and gobbled down their prey. 
</P>
<P>
That afternoon, on her way home from <LOCATION>Washington Middle School</LOCATION>, a sprawling, 
1920s building in <LOCATION>northwest Pasadena</LOCATION>, Uyemura stopped at a local nursery. On 
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, she marched into class carrying five bona fide <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' flytraps 
she had purchased for <MONEY>five dollars</MONEY> each. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't get reimbursed for things like that, but I feel the kids have to see 
how it happens, so it's not just something they read in a book," Uyemura 
explained. "If that makes it more exciting for them, then it's worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Uyemura thought it especially important to grab her students' interest this 
week because it marks the beginning of the <DATE>spring</DATE> semester and a new lesson 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
All fall, the sixth grade had studied health science, learning about hearts, 
brains and human reproduction. From now on, they would focus on the natural 
sciences. Uyemura believed that carnivorous plants, which lured insects to 
their death by secreting drug-like poisons, were loaded with enough 
science-fiction-type drama to capture her students' imagination as surely as 
the <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' flytrap captured bugs. 
</P>
<P>
First came the book lesson. Uyemura called on students to read aloud while she 
wrote down key facts on the blackboard, her chalk slap-slapping against the 
greenish-black surface, her letters as neat and rounded as a sample in a 
penmanship book. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd better be writing down all these facts because you're going to need them 
for your reports," Uyemura admonished the class. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh man, I thought you said we only had to write down three facts," grumbled a 
voice from the back of the room. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I didn't say that," Uyemura answered evenly, and kept writing about how 
the <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' flytrap had hinged leaves with reddish centers that secreted a 
sweet-smelling liquid to attract insects. The plant also had tiny trigger hairs 
that caused the leaves to snap shut when the <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' flytrap sensed prey. 
</P>
<P>
Once ensnared, the plant secreted juices like stomach acids to break the insect 
down into needed nutrients. Botanists who sliced open these plants had found 
leftovers -- tiny undigested insect parts, Uyemura told the class. 
</P>
<P>
In the front of the room, <PERSON>Margaret Gonzalez</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lupe Jaramillo</PERSON> scrunched up 
their faces and exchanged looks of disgust. 
</P>
<P>
"I think those plants are nasty," added 12-year-old <PERSON>Miesha McCall</PERSON>, who wore a 
pink jacket and fashionable red shoes embossed with gold trim. "I think it's 
gross how they eat those flies." 
</P>
<P>
"I'd put the bug on the end of a straw and stick it near the plant," she added. 
"I don't want it to bite my finger off." 
</P>
<P>
Her friend <PERSON>Aisha Owens</PERSON>, wearing a pink warm-up suit, her long hair braided in 
cornrows, looked at her askance. 
</P>
<P>
"Nuh-uh, it's just a plant. It doesn't hurt if it touches your finger," <PERSON>Aisha</PERSON> 
advised her friend. 
</P>
<P>
Although neither girl had ever seen a Venus' flytrap before, they were familiar 
with the concept thanks to a <ORGANIZATION>Nintendo</ORGANIZATION> video game called <ORGANIZATION>Super Mario Brothers</ORGANIZATION>. 
In the game, players lead a little character through a danger-strewn path to 
rescue a princess. One of the recurring obstacles is a voracious <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' flytrap 
that pops up at unexpected moments to swallow the character. 
</P>
<P>
On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, it was time to feed the flesh-and-blood flytraps. Uyemura 
divided the students into groups of six and placed a plant in front of each 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Next, she sent a five-student expedition into the woodsy corners of the 
sprawling campus to hunt down aphids, ants, pill bugs and whatever else they 
could scavenge. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the girls were aghast to learn that ladybugs also might be sacrificed 
as plant chow. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, don't kill the ladybug. It's pretty and it's a good bug," begged <PERSON>Tonique 
Delaney</PERSON>, when one of her fellow hunters captured one of the round, red insects 
on a grassy slope. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Camea Gholar balked at touching bugs. But egged on by the others, she 
was soon poking into bushes in pursuit of more insects, as she cradled a lone 
pill bug gingerly in her hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I got me a whole family," said <PERSON>Shahe Demirjian</PERSON>, opening his palm to show a 
cache of rolled-up gray pill bugs, also known on the playground as roly-polys. 
</P>
<P>
As the kids returned, bearing their bugs in firmly clenched fists and 
scoop-shaped pieces of paper, the excitement mounted. 
</P>
<P>
"The students who captured the bugs get to feed them to the plant," Uyemura 
announced, to a chorus of disappointed moans. 
</P>
<P>
But there were plenty to go around. 
</P>
<P>
"Oooooh, get in there," the students exclaimed, helping the pill-bugs into the 
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' flytraps with the tips of pencils. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going in." 
</P>
<P>
"Where are the trigger hairs?" 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, somebody, give me some insects." 
</P>
<P>
For a moment they were silent. Then, a chorus of howls left from their throats, 
as group after group watched the plants snap shut, trapping the unfortunate 
insects inside. 
</P>
<P>
One plant closed around an insect's upper half, leaving the other end wriggling 
while the children clustered around in fascinated horror. 
</P>
<P>
"Boy, your plant is hungry." 
</P>
<P>
"That plant tried to bite <PERSON>Chris</PERSON>' finger off." 
</P>
<P>
Uyemura explained that the <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' flytraps would take at least half a day to 
digest their meals. Then they would reopen. Seven kids were so taken with the 
strange plants that they promised to bring <MONEY>$5</MONEY> to school the next day if Uyemura 
would buy them each their own pet plant. 
</P>
<P>
Just then, the lunch bell rang and, still flushed with excitement from their 
botany lesson, the sixth-graders of Room 115 headed off to eat their own meals. 
</P>
<P>
Later, <ORGANIZATION>Uyemura</ORGANIZATION> would assign the class to write essays about what they had just 
witnessed. 
</P>
<P>
Gerardo Frayre would phrase his thoughts most eloquently. 
</P>
<P>
Carnivorous plants, wrote Frayre, "are a death wish for insects."

<HEAD>Magellan Finds Sand Dunes on Venus</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Space Shuttle, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft has found sand
dunes on Venus despite low wind and little loose sediment on the
planet.
   ``They look a lot like sand dunes on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Ray Arvidson</PERSON>,
a geologist from <ORGANIZATION>Washington University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> and a <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
scientist at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``This is a fairly rare occurrence on Venus,'' he said
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. ``This area just had a beautiful supply of sediment to
be reworked into dunes.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s pictures revealed the dune field in an area of Los
Angeles-sized meteorite craters. The field is 30 to 40 miles long,
and each dune is hundreds of yards wide, <PERSON>Arvidson</PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
hasn't determined their height.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s images have shown <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> has very little loose
sediment. That's because the planet lacks water to erode rock.
   Surface winds on Venus measure only a few miles per hour, but
the atmosphere is so dense that even such light winds can lift
sediment, he said. Atmospheric pressure on <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' surface is 90
times the pressure at sea level on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Arvidson</PERSON> said the sediment that was blown around to form the
dunes may have stemmed from a meteorite impact that shattered or
melted rock. Another possibility is that the meteorite was a
water-rich comet, he added.
   Magellan bounces radar off Venus to make pictures and maps of
the planet, which can't be photographed with optical cameras
because of its thick cloud cover.
   The pictures have shown numerous volcanoes, volcanic collapse
craters, long rivers of solidified lava, extensive faults, deep
valleys and towering ridges.
   Magellan began orbiting <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE> after a roundabout trip
from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> of 948 million miles. The spacecraft was launched from
the shuttle Atlantis in <DATE>May 1989</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> were 158.6
million miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.

   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s latest pictures of Venus show
meteorite craters the size of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, a river of solidified

   ``These are extremely jazzy images,'' said <PERSON>Gordon Pettengill</PERSON>, a

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> displayed the pictures of the cloud-covered planet at the
<ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   ``Believe me, it's giving us a revolutionary new view of
Venus,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Brown University</ORGANIZATION> geologist <PERSON>Jim Head</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
scientist.
   With <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> only 10 days into its 243-day mission to map the
planet, Head advised: ``Don't touch your dial. We think we have a
blockbuster fall season.''
   <PERSON>Steve Saunders</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s chief scientist, displayed a
computer-generated videotape of three-dimensional images showing
Venus from the perspective of someone swooping down to and around a
crater on its surface.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> started its <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY> picture- and map-making
mission <DATE>Sept. 15, two weeks later</DATE> than planned because engineers
temporarily lost radio contact with the spacecraft twice in <DATE>August</DATE>.
   One picture displayed <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> shows two volcanoes, each with a
windblown fan of debris extending about six miles from the
mountain's summit crater. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said the fans look like ``fallout
from volcanic explosion plumes.''
   While <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> hasn't seen a volcano actually erupting, it has
made pictures of so many volcanic features that ``there is an
excellent possibility there is active volcanism somewhere on the
planet,'' Head said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> also spotted a caldera, or crater caused by the
collapse of a volcano's summit, almost two miles deep - roughly
twice the depth of the Grand Canyon and deeper than any other
caldera seen in the solar system, scientists said.
   A hardened lava river eight-tenths of a mile wide and about 200
miles long was mapped by <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> as well.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> also showed a picture of a meteorite impact crater about 28
miles wide. ``Greater <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> would fit approximately in the
floor of this crater,'' Head said.
   Another picture showed three big impact craters, one of them
even larger, with a width of about 30 miles.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was launched from the space shuttle Atlantis in <DATE>May
1989</DATE> and arrived at Venus after traveling a looping path of 948
million miles.
   Chief engineer <PERSON>John Slonski Jr.</PERSON> said a backup computer that
played a role in the radio blackouts still malfunctions
occasionally, so contact might be lost again.
   The cause of the problems remains unknown. Suspicion focuses on
possible damage to electronic components that happened when
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> started orbiting Venus <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE> and on static in the wiring
linking its computers, <PERSON>Slonski</PERSON> said.

   Being a Venus' flytrap is no snap.
   First, the plant's popularity with American children has
waned. And it got bad publicity in the film "Little Shop of
Horrors." Now thousands of them are being filched from the
few remaining spots where they grow.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Officials in <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> say the flytrap, the plant
with the bristled leaves that clamp shut on bugs, is in a
fight for survival. Developers and industry have crowded the
carnivore out of many of the wetlands where it once grew (in
the wild, it's now found in only 11 counties in the
<LOCATION>Carolinas</LOCATION>). The shrinking habitat and continuing demand
overseas have made the plant a poachers' favorite.
   "Whole savannas where flytraps were abundant have been
cleaned out," says <PERSON>Cecil Frost</PERSON>, coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION>North
Carolina Plant Conservation Program</ORGANIZATION>.
   The poaching problem has become so severe that, effective
<DATE>June 1</DATE>, the state's <ORGANIZATION>Plant Conservation Board</ORGANIZATION> stiffened the
penalties for picking flytraps. Fines can run <MONEY>$100</MONEY> to <MONEY>$500</MONEY>
per plant for a first offense and as much as <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> for a
second offense.
   Undaunted, more than 25 poachers are making a living by
digging up flytraps in the 50,000-acre <ORGANIZATION>Holly Shelter</ORGANIZATION> game
lands, estimates <PERSON>Herman Strickland</PERSON>, a state wildlife officer.
"As hot as it is, they'll walk eight to 10 miles to dig these
things," says <PERSON>Mr. Strickland</PERSON>. "They're taking the chance of
ticks, parasites and snakes. We know good well they're making
money to go to that trouble." The state estimates that a
poacher can make more than <MONEY>$200</MONEY> a day harvesting flytraps.
   Despite the run on wild flytraps, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> demand for them has
waned, according to the largest flytrap grower, <PERSON>James
Northrop</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Northrop</ORGANIZATION>'s Insectivorous Plant Farm in <LOCATION>Hampstead</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION> "Twenty-five years ago every kid had a Venus' flytrap,"
he laments. "Now they don't."
   But there are still buyers abroad. <PERSON>Lorenzo Marshall</PERSON>, a
nursery owner in <LOCATION>Harrison Creek</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>, sells <PERCENT>75%</PERCENT> of his
flytraps to <LOCATION>Holland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>. Most go to a German
pharmaceutical company that extracts a flytrap enzyme for a
drug used in cancer and AIDS cases. With stiffer fines
scaring away some illegal competition, <PERSON>Mr. Marshall</PERSON> gained
five international customers in recent months.
   The plants definitely have their local fans. "I'd love to
have a whole lot more around," says <PERSON>Milton McLean</PERSON>, another
wildlife officer. "They eat ticks."

   Venus may be ``a terrible place to
live,'' but scientists believe the planet's torrid temperatures,
incredible pressures and sulfuric acid rain may be a great place to
learn about the solar system's evolution.
   A robot craft called <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, the first American space probe in
11 years, is on its way to survey <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> for clues to the forces
that molded all the inner planets orbiting the sun.
   The <MONEY>$550 million</MONEY> craft will use a powerful radar imaging system
to map <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' surface, where scientists believe the geologic
history of the planet is imprinted. By studying that history,
scientists hope to learn what's contained in the ``the missing
chapters'' of solar system evolution.
   <PERSON>Lennard Fisk</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s chief scientist, said <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> is known as the
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s sister planet because it is about the same size as <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
and close to the same distance from the sun, in astronomical terms.
Venus, the second planet from the sun, is 67 million miles away,
while <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, the third planet, is 93 million miles out.
   Despite the similarities, <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> ``has evolved into ... a
substantially different object,'' <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON> said.
   ``It has an atmosphere that is 90 times that of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. It
has a runaway greenhouse effect. It has a surface temperature of
900 degrees. And it rains sulfuric acid,'' <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON> said. ``It would be
a terrible place to live.''
   The <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, along with <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION> and Mars, are known as
the ``inner planets'' because of their grouping nearer to the sun
than the ``outer'' planets, such as <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus.
   The family of inner planets are all thought to have accreted, or
formed, 4.5 billion years ago. In the beginning, it's believed,
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> were near-twins in size and character.
   But while the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> went on to become a lovely, gentle world
thriving with life, <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> became a hellhole _ so hot that lead
melts on its surface.
   ``You've got to ask yourself why?'' <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON> said. ``You've got to
ask yourself if our own environment is that fragile? With only
small changes, could Earth evolve into a different place?''
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> may help answer some of those questions.
   The spacecraft is scheduled to slip into <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' orbit in <DATE>August
1990</DATE>, and spend the following 243 days mapping the planet's surface
with the most sophisticated radar ever sent to deep space.
   Radar signals are able to penetrate the dense cloud cover that
conceals Venus from telescopes on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Radar views from <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
will be enhanced by <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> computers to give clear pictures of
powerful geologic forces at work on Venus.
   All the data could help experts ponder a fundamental question:
Is the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, like <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, fated to one day become a barren,
lifeless world backing in superheat and bathed by acids?
   Scientists expect to find thousands of volcanoes rising from the
baked Venusian plains. Venus also has vast mountain ranges with
peaks towering higher than the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Mount Everest</LOCATION>.
   Most scientists believe the runaway greenhouse effect on <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>,
caused by its thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide, long ago caused
all water on the planet to boil away.
   The experts also will look for indications of continental drift,
the force that causes rock plates to inch about the globe over
millions of years.
   If there is evidence of volcanism and crustal drift on <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, it
will prove that the planet retains enough internal heat to melt
rock. The internal heat machine is what creates the lava for
volcanoes and drives the movement of continents.
   Meteors crashing into the shallow surface crust of the planet
are expected to have left craters in every sector of Venus. <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON>
said these scars will be of particular interest to experts. The age
of a solid planet or moon, he said, can be calculated by the number
and distribution of craters.
   ``Knowing whether Earth is a fluke or just one of the natural
consequences of the evolution of a generic solar system'' will help
answer such questions, said <PERSON>Laurence Soderblom</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Flagstaff</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz</LOCATION>.
   He said <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> also may help scientists deduce ``the
probability you're going to find Earth-like planets _ and life _
somewhere else'' in the universe.

   The <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft found that
600-mile-wide circular features on <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> are mile-high volcanic
bulges created as molten rock bubbles up from inside the planet, a
scientist said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   From a bird's-eye-view, the bulges look like nested sets of
concentric rings. Called coronas, the rings are ridges and valleys
that form huge circles. Numerous volcanoes and lava flows dot the
coronas.
   The coronas are formed by the same kind of upwelling of
underground plumes of molten rock that created the <LOCATION>Hawaiian
Islands</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Ellen Stofan</PERSON>, a geologist at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   ``They're definitely formed by some sort of thermal pulse from
the interior of the planet'' that lasts hundreds of millions of
years, she said.
   In <DATE>1983</DATE> and <DATE>1984</DATE>, the Soviet Venera 15 and 16 spacecraft
identified about 30 coronas that measure from 75 miles to more than
600 miles across. But the Venera orbiters couldn't determine if
they were upward bulges or depressions in the ground caused by the
impacts of gargantuan meteorites.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is examining the planet with a more sophisticated
radar, which makes much more detailed pictures and also is able to
calculate surface topography. It found five more coronas and
determined they rise as much as one mile above the surrounding
terrain. <PERSON>Stofan</PERSON> said that shows they are hot spots rather than
impact craters.
   One corona that's 150 miles wide seems to be in the early stages
of bulging upward, suggesting that some of its small volcanic domes
and lava flows may be actively erupting, she said.
   Magellan won't be able to confirm the presence of active
volcanoes until the middle of next year, when it passes over the
same part of Venus a second time and can look for landscape changes
resulting from any ongoing eruptions.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers, meanwhile, said the sun will almost block
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s view of <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> on <DATE>Nov. 1</DATE> when <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, the sun
and <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION> will be oriented in almost a straight line.
   That will cause a nine-day halt - starting sometime between
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> and <DATE>Monday</DATE> - in <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s use of radar to peer through
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' clouds and map the planet, said <PERSON>Phil Allin</PERSON>, administrative
assistant to <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s project manager.
   The astronomical lineup, called ``superior conjunction,'' also
may make <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> completely lose contact with <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> for up to three
days, although engineers disagree on whether that will happen,
<PERSON>Allin</PERSON> said.
   The sun won't completely block Earth's view of Venus and
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> during the planetary lineup, but activity from the sun
already has impaired some communications, he said.
   Engineers twice lost touch with <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>August</DATE> due to a
yet-unidentified problem. If that happens again when the
Venus-sun-Earth alignment also makes communication difficult or
impossible, ``we worry about how quickly we would get things back
to normal,'' <PERSON>Allin</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>May 4,
1989</DATE>, and arrived at the second planet from the sun on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE>.

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> restored high-speed communications
with <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> for the first time in four weeks <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, then
released more of the spacecraft's pictures of jagged lava flows and
giant craters on Venus.
   The irregularly shaped craters _ one measuring 5 miles wide _
are called calderas. Each one probably formed when lava flowed out
from underneath the planet's volcanoes, causing the entire top of a
volcano to collapse, said <PERSON>Steve Saunders</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project
scientist.
   A lava flow shown in another picture is ``much like flows on
Earth that are called by geologists `aa' (ah-ah), a Hawaiian word
that probably mimics the sound the ancients uttered while running
barefoot over the rough, jagged surface,'' <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said in a news
release.
   The images were made during an <DATE>Aug. 16</DATE> test of <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s
picture-making radar, just before the spaceship temporarily lost
contact with <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> for the first time. Engineers at the <ORGANIZATION>National
Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory
spent <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> preparing <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> so that it can attempt to make
more pictures during a crucial test on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   They turned the spacecraft so its main antenna pointed toward
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, experiment representative <PERSON>Steve Wall</PERSON> said. That allowed
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> to send back information at up to 268,800 ``bits'' per
second, 6,720 times faster than was possible through its secondary
antenna, which has been used since the communications problems
developed.
   The secondary antenna has a broader radio beam, allowing it to
maintain contact with <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> more easily than the main antenna.
   Restoring the high-speed link was necessary so engineers could
play back the contents of an onboard tape recorder. The recorder
contains more of the radar picture data collected <DATE>Aug. 16</DATE> and
engineering information that may provide clues about <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s
troubles.
   The engineers still haven't identified the problem that made
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> lose radio contact with <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> for 14 hours starting <DATE>Aug.
16</DATE> and for 17{ hours beginning <DATE>Aug. 21</DATE>, <PERSON>Wall</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s computers rejected a command <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to turn off a
faulty gyroscope that developed problems when the spacecraft
started orbiting Venus <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE>. The device is no longer needed to
help point <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, and engineers said it won't harm the mission.
   Plans call for <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> to formally start its <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY>
mission to use radar to makes maps and pictures of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>'
cloud-covered surface late this month, <PERSON>Wall</PERSON> said.
   But unless the tape playback reveals an unforeseen problem,
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s radar will be turned on <DATE>Friday</DATE> and tested <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. If
all goes well and <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> produces more highly detailed pictures,
officials might simply declare afterward that the formal mapping
mission started <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   One of the pictures released <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> shows a basalt lava flow
11 miles wide and at least 15} miles long. It has lobed edges, is
extremely rough, and probably flowed in a ``thick, pasty'' manner
before it solidified, <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said.
   Another picture shows at least two volcanic calderas, similar to
those in the summit area of broad shield volcanoes such as <ORGANIZATION>Mauna
Loa</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Kilauea</LOCATION> on <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>. The largest measures 5 miles long by 2.2
miles wide.
   Calderas on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> usually are much larger than typical volcanic
craters. Hawaiian, Icelandic and apparently the Venusian calderas
were created when lava flowed from vents on the flanks of
volcanoes, causing their summits to collapse.
   Earth's biggest calderas were formed by extraordinarily
explosive eruptions. Examples include calderas at <ORGANIZATION>Yellowstone
National Park</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> and at <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Long Valley-Mammoth
Lakes</LOCATION> resort area.
   A third new Venus picture shows a valley, about six-tenths of a
mile wide, that formed when a block of land dropped down between
two faults as the area was being stretched apart, <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said.
The valley cuts through a series of older ridges and valleys, but
was partially flooded by later lava flows.
   Similar fault-bounded valleys are found in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>East
Africa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>.
   Magellan went into orbit around <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> after traveling a looping
948-million-mile path since its from the shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>May 4,
1989</DATE>.

   Engineers turned on <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s radar
<DATE>Friday</DATE> for the first time in a month, preparing the sometimes
unruly spacecraft to start mapping the rugged landscape of
cloud-covered <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   ``I personally am excited and jumping around,'' said <PERSON>Ed Sherry</PERSON>,
technical assistant to the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project manager at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
   The last and only other time engineers used <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s radar was
during a picture-making test on <DATE>Aug. 16</DATE>, only hours before they
lost touch with the spacecraft for 14 hours. Radio contact was lost
again for 17{ hours starting <DATE>Aug. 21</DATE>.
   ``I am delighted to see the blue sky that we knew was at the end
of this tunnel,'' <PERSON>Sherry</PERSON> said <DATE>Friday</DATE> after engineers received
confirmation at <TIME>8:14 a.m. PDT</TIME> that they successfully turned on the
radar.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s radar was to remain on standby until <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, when
it will be ordered to send radar waves through <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' thick clouds
and bounce them off the rugged surface. <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> then will collect
the reflected radar echoes and send the data to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, where it
will be made into pictures and maps.
   If all goes well, the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION> hopes to release new pictures of Venus early next
week, <PERSON>Sherry</PERSON> said.
   He cautioned that <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> may lose contact with <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> again
because engineers have yet to determine the cause of the earlier
blackouts.
   But they have equipped <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> with new computer commands that
should allow them to restore contact within four to 24 hours if it
is lost again, then resume mapping within two weeks.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s official stance is that <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY> mapping
mission won't start until late this month. But if everything works
well this <DATE>weekend</DATE>, officials may declare retroactively that mapping
began <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, <PERSON>Sherry</PERSON> said.
   ``We're not being foolhardy and rushing into a restart of
operations,'' said <PERSON>David Okerson</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> engineer.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s first pictures of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> - made during the <DATE>Aug. 16</DATE>
radar test - showed surprisingly violent forces shape the planet.
   The pictures revealed vast flows of solidified lava, volcanic
cinder cones, huge meteorite impact craters, extensive
``Venusquake'' faults, numerous valleys and mountain ridges and
large calderas. The calderas are volcanic craters created when the
summit of a volcano collapses as lava flows out from vents on the
volcano's flanks.
   <PERSON>Sherry</PERSON> said that during the <DATE>weekend</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will fly over
<LOCATION>Ishtar Terra</LOCATION> - a continent-like highland area about the size of
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> - and a plain on Ishtar that is named Lakshmi Planum.
   Optical cameras can't penetrate <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' thick clouds. <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s
radar penetrates the clouds to make pictures 10 times more detailed
than those produced by Earth-based radar or radar on the Soviet
Venera 15 and 16 spacecraft, which visited Venus in the mid-1980s.
   Magellan went into orbit around <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE> after a looping
948 million-mile voyage from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. It was launched from the space
shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>May 4, 1989</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s primary mission will last 243 days - the time it
takes for Venus to rotate once as <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> circles the planet in a
nearly polar orbit.
   The spacecraft should be able to map <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of
the surface during the initial mapping mission. But <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials
have said they expect to extend <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s mission so the entire
planet can be mapped.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> made its <DATE>Aug. 16</DATE> pictures during two orbits around
Venus. But only 1{ orbits worth of picture data were returned
before contact was lost. <PERSON>Sherry</PERSON> said half the remaining picture
information was radioed to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. Engineers
hoped to retrieve the remainder early <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   Despite 900-degree Fahrenheit surface temperatures created by a
runaway ``greenhouse effect,'' <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> is the planet most like <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
in terms of size, mass, density and distance from the sun.
   Scientists hope to learn the extent to which <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> is shaped by
forces similar to those that sculpted <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s terrain.
   They are particularly interested in knowing if <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> has plate
tectonics, which is the movement of giant plates of crustal rock
that makes continents drift slowly across the face of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Many scientists doubt <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> has drifting plates, and believe its
crustal movements are caused by ``hot spots'' in which molten
material bubbles upward - the process that created the <LOCATION>Hawaiian
Islands</LOCATION> on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.

Venus, a planet that started out like the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> but took a dramatic turn 
somewhere along the way, is turning out to be a geological candy store as it 
lays bare its soul for the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
Photographs released <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by the <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> show a planet 
that is pockmarked with giant impact craters large enough to swallow <LOCATION>Los 
Angeles</LOCATION> and a twisted, tormented landscape that has been molded by forces that 
are still not understood. 
</P>
<P>
"These are extremely jazzy images," said <PERSON>Gordon H. Pettengill</PERSON> of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>, principal investigator for <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s 
radar science team. The images were captured by an electronic "camera" that 
uses radar beams to pierce through the dense atmosphere that normally hides the 
surface of the hot, barren planet. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists hope that <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will help them understand why Venus -- the planet 
that is most like the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in size, mass and distance from the sun -- turned 
out to be so different: devoid of life, with surface temperatures hot enough to 
melt lead and a heavy atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
After a troubled beginning, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> seems to be doing its best to help unravel 
the mysteries, but some of the images produce more questions than answers. 
</P>
<P>
The spacecraft has mapped the surface for more than 80 orbits as it flies in a 
polar trajectory around <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>. The problems that caused the craft to sever its 
communications with Earth twice are not fully understood, said chief engineer 
<PERSON>John P. Slonski Jr.</PERSON>, so <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is not completely safe yet. 
</P>
<P>
"The problems may happen again," <PERSON>Slonski</PERSON> told a press conference at the 
<LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> lab. He said that even if the "root cause" of the blackouts has not 
been determined, engineers have at least narrowed the range of probabilities 
and taken steps to protect <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that the images captured by <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> have demonstrated 
that <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> is an extraordinary laboratory in which to test geological theories 
because the photographs are clear and reveal a geological record spanning 
hundreds of millions of years. 
</P>
<P>
On Earth, the evidence of earthquakes and volcanoes disappears over time 
because of vegetation and erosion. On <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, where there is no vegetation and 
very little erosion, the geological record stands out in brilliant clarity. 
</P>
<P>
One of the new images shows an extraordinary pattern of what appears to be a 
crosshatching of faults. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an extremely regular pattern," said <PERSON>James W. Head II</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Brown University</ORGANIZATION>, 
co-investigator on the radar science team. "The regularity is so remarkable," 
he said, that "we have no idea how these (patterns) would form." 
</P>
<P>
It is possible that there are similar areas on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, he said, but they must be 
hidden by vegetation or erosion. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, "erosion does not appear to be a fundamental process" on the 
surface of <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Head</PERSON> said. That is because there is no water to wash away the 
soil and produce sediments that could be transported by the wind, and the wind 
amounts to little more than a slight breeze. 
</P>
<P>
"We're so used to water eroding the surface of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>," Head said. "It's 
astonishing to see all this detail. When you create (a geological feature on 
Venus) it stays there a long time." 
</P>
<P>
If <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> can capture a photo of an active volcano on <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, it would answer 
whether the planet is alive in a volcanic sense, but nothing in the images 
transmitted to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> shows that. 
</P>
<P>
Head pointed out that <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> has covered only <PERCENT>1 1/2%</PERCENT> of the surface of Venus 
so far. If you looked at that much of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s surface, you probably would 
not see any active volcanoes either, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Head indicated that he believes he already knows the answer. "It's very much 
alive," he said of Venus. 
</P>
<P>
The images from <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> reveal a surface that could be changing even as the 
spacecraft zips overhead. In addition to faulting and cratering, the newly 
released images show a "river" of lava hundreds of miles long. The images also 
show giant volcanoes similar to those in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The most spectacular image is a mosaic covering an area about half the size of 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. It was displayed at <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> as a 10-foot-by-12-foot mural, and it shows 
giant craters up to 30 miles in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
One image shows an impact crater that is nearly two miles deep. All of the 
impact craters are at least five miles in diameter. Scientists said that is 
because only the largest objects survive the long journey through space to 
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' surface. Smaller meteoroids apparently break up as they crash through 
the dense atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is expected to spend nearly a year mapping <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, and scientists said 
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that they expect far more images and a lot of surprises. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't touch that dial," Head said. "We think we've got a blockbuster <DATE>fall</DATE> 
season coming up."

   The spacecraft <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> bombarded Venus
with radar <DATE>Saturday</DATE> in the first attempt to make pictures of the
planet's cloud-shrouded surface since engineers temporarily lost
touch with it last month.
   ``Most people are sighing with relief,'' said <PERSON>Jim Scott</PERSON>,
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> mission director at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``We're just happy to
get into the position where we wanted to be.''
   Acting on computerized commands radioed 154.9 million miles from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> started bouncing radar off the planet during the
morning and engineers received confirmation 13 minutes later, <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>
said.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Deep Space Network</ORGANIZATION> tracking station at <LOCATION>Goldstone</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>,
started receiving data on the radar images, and computers will
assemble it into pictures that will be released to the public early
this week, said <PERSON>Ed Sherry</PERSON>, technical assistant to <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s
project manager.
   ``I'm just delighted. I'm happy as a clam,'' he said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY> mission is designed to produce the most
detailed pictures yet of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' surface, totally concealed by
clouds, as well as a global map of the planet. It was launched from
the space shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>May 4, 1989</DATE>, and started orbiting
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON> on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE>, after a looping 948 million-mile voyage from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The spacecraft's radar makes pictures 10 times more detailed
than those produced by Earth-based radar or radar on the Soviet
Venera 15 and 16 spacecraft, which reached Venus in the mid-1980s.
   Engineers lost radio contact with <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> for 14 hours starting
<DATE>Aug. 16</DATE>, then for 17{ hours beginning <DATE>Aug. 21</DATE>. They still haven't
learned the cause of the temporary blackouts, which they believe
could happen again.
   But they gave <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> new computer instructions so it can
recover quickly from future communications breakdowns.
   The <DATE>Aug. 16</DATE> blackout happened only hours after <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> used its
radar for its first pictures of Venus during two orbits around the
planet. Only 1{ orbits worth of picture information was sent to
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> before contact was lost.
   Half the remaining picture information was radioed to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> on
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and the rest was sent back <DATE>Saturday</DATE> before mapping
resumed, <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> said.
   The first pictures showed <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> has large flows of solidified
lava; pervasive ``Venusquake'' faults; big meteorite impact
craters; volcanic cinder cones; large collapsed volcanic craters,
called calderas; and parallel mountain ridges and valleys like
those in the <LOCATION>Great Basin</LOCATION> that covers most of <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> and western
<LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s official position is that <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s formal mapping
mission won't begin until late this month. But if all goes well
through the <DATE>weekend</DATE>, officials may decide afterward that the
243-day mapping effort began <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sherry</PERSON> said.
   Venus, the second planet from the sun, rotates once on its axis
every 243 Earth days. Magellan circles <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> in a nearly polar
orbit, so as <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> revolves beneath it the craft should be able to
map <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of the planet during its 243-day
mission. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>, however, has said it expects to use <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> for
additional 243-day cycles so the entire planet can be mapped.
   Venus is considered <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s virtual twin in terms of size, mass,
density and distance from the sun, although the planet's surface
has been heated to 900 degrees Fahrenheit by a runaway ``greenhouse
effect.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s goal to learn exactly what forces shape <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, and
whether its crust is broken into giant drifting plates like those
that carry continents across the face of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Many scientists believe Venusian crustal movements are
predominated by ``hot spots'' - rising subterranean plumes of
molten rock like those that created the <LOCATION>Hawaiian Islands</LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> ended a two-week hiatus
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> and resumed its radar mapping of the surface of Venus.
   The lull in the spacecraft's <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY> mission was necessary
because <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, the sun and <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> were lined up in a way that
hindered communication between <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> and controllers at <ORGANIZATION>National
Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> engineer <PERSON>Cynthia Haynie</PERSON> said the orbiter began bouncing
radar waves off the cloudy planet at <TIME>4:11 a.m. PST</TIME>.
   The radar echoes are collected by <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> for transmission to
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, where they are assembled into maps and pictures.
   ``Everything went great,'' <PERSON>Haynie</PERSON> said.
   The mapping had been suspended since <DATE>Oct. 26</DATE>.
   Engineers used the time to work on figuring out how to fix a
computer programming glitch that caused <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s twin solar
panels to wobble.
   A new program to stop the wobbling will be radioed to <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
and activated next week, said <PERSON>Ed Sherry</PERSON>, technical assistant to
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s project manager.
   The panels are essential for charging <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s batteries, but
the vibration hasn't prevented them from gathering solar energy.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> uses radar because the thick Venusian clouds prevent
optical cameras from photographing the planet's surface.
   The spacecraft was launched from space shuttle Atlantis in <DATE>May
1989</DATE> and went into orbit around <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE>. Mapping began in
<DATE>September</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> has made pictures of volcanoes, huge solidified lava
flows, extensive quake faults, city-sized meteorite craters and
600-mile-wide, mile-high bulges created as molten rock pushes
upward from inside the planet.
   It also found evidence that ocean-sized floods of molten rock
once inundated more than half the surface.

   Thick, pasty lava once oozed onto the
surface of Venus to form 15-mile-wide domes that look like giant
pancakes or coconut macaroons in the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft's newest
pictures.
   Heat measurements made by the spacecraft show fool's gold or
other iron-rich metallic minerals coat the slopes of the planet's
tallest peak, 7-mile-high <ORGANIZATION>Mount Maxwell</ORGANIZATION>.
   Scientists released new radar pictures <DATE>Friday</DATE> during a news
conference at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Engineers were relieved they were able to regain contact with
the spacecraft after a 40-minute blackout <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. It was the
third such communications failure in three months. Project manager
<PERSON>Tony Spear</PERSON> said it could happen again, but called <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s health
``very good.''
   Some pictures show 600-mile-long, 300-mile-wide horseshoe-shaped
features, each surrounding a meteorite impact crater 10 miles to 15
miles wide.
   The horseshoes may have been formed by shock waves triggered by
incoming meteorites or by windblown debris that settled to the
ground after being kicked up by the impacts, said geologist <PERSON>Ray
Arvidson</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Washington University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>.
   They are ``unique in the solar system,'' he said.
   The space agency also displayed a computer-processed videotape
that shows <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' surface from the perspective of someone swooping
over 130-mile-wide, half-mile-deep volcanic collapse craters and
38,000-foot-tall <PERSON>Mount Maxwell</PERSON>, the planet's tallest mountain.
   One of the new pictures shows seven lava domes, similar but much
larger than the lava dome inside the crater of <ORGANIZATION>Mount St. Helens</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> state, said <PERSON>Steve Saunders</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s chief scientist.
   ``They look like coconut macaroons. They look like pancakes,''
he said. ``They're about 2,500 feet high and 15 miles across.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s heat measurements show some of the middle slopes of
<ORGANIZATION>Mount Maxwell</ORGANIZATION> contain ``mystery material'' that emits little heat,
said <PERSON>Gordon Pettengill</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts Institute of
Technology</ORGANIZATION>.
   That means the slopes are coated with soil containing metallic
material, either iron pyrite - called fool's gold because it looks
like gold - or iron minerals called hematite and magnetite,
<PERSON>Pettengill</PERSON> said.
   Radar pictures show numerous mountain ridges and valleys created
by squeezing of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' hot, thin crust, said <PERSON>Sean Solomon</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>MIT</ORGANIZATION>.
In places, the mountains are no longer being squeezed upward, and
are collapsing down onto lowland plains, he added.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>May 4,
1989</DATE>, arrived at Venus on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE> and formally started mapping the
planet <DATE>Sept. 15</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> has used radar to peer through clouds and map <PERCENT>18
percent</PERCENT> of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' landscape, comparable to an area on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
stretching from <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Reykjavik</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iceland</LOCATION>, and covering
most of <LOCATION>North and South America</LOCATION>.
   <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s loss of contact with <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> halted mapping for most
of the day. Engineers still don't know the exact cause but suspect
excess static sometimes disrupts one of <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s computers, <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION>
said.
   Those malfunctions and other problems will add about <MONEY>$3 million</MONEY>
to <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY> to the <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY> cost of <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s mission, <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION>
said.

   Engineers performed a partial memory
transplant on one of <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s computers as they tried to make
sure they don't lose touch with the unruly space probe for a third
time as it orbits Venus.
   Engineers haven't pinpointed the problem that made them
temporarily lose contact with <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> twice during the past week.
They replaced the faulty computer memory because ``we're fixing the
symptoms,'' <PERSON>Ed Sherry</PERSON>, technical assistant to <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s project
manager, said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   Scientists at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory today planned to
release more of <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s early pictures of <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, made during a
test just before the first communications breakdown <DATE>Aug. 16</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautic and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> released
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s first Venus images <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, only hours before losing
radio contact with the wayward spacecraft the second time.
   The first batch of test pictures showed numerous ``Venusquake''
faults, old lava flows, craters, cinder cones, valleys and ridges
on Venus. That means at least part of Venus is shaped by some of
the same violent forces that sculpted <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   A laboratory official said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that one of the pictures
being released today showed an interesting crater on the planet's
surface.
   Earlier this week, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s chief scientist <PERSON>Steve Saunders</PERSON>
said that unreleased <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> pictures showed a 20-mile-wide crater
that also had been seen by the Soviet Venera 15 and 16 spacecraft
in the mid-1980s.
   The Soviet pictures were about 10 times less detailed than
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s radar images, so it wasn't clear if the crater was
volcanic or caused by a meteorite impact.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s pictures clearly show it is an impact crater, but the
floor of the crater is extremely smooth, indicating it was flooded
by lava that later solidified, <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said.
   He said the crater may have filled with lava from an eruption
triggered when a meteorite punched completely through <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' crust.
Or the lava simply may have filled the crater much later in an
eruption unrelated to the impact.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is on a <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY> mission to use its radar to peer
through the clouds of Venus and make the most detailed pictures and
maps yet of the second planet from the sun. It went into orbit
around <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE>, about 15 months after it was launched from
the shuttle Atlantis. It now is nearly 150 million miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Sherry</PERSON> said engineers don't yet know how long <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s
troubles will delay the official start of its mapping effort, which
was to begin the <DATE>first week of September</DATE>.
   The ultimate problem that caused the malfunction remains
unknown. But flight data show that <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> the spacecraft's
automatic safety systems were unable to maintain radio contact as
expected because part of the memory was ``corrupted'' in a backup
computer that helps point <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Sherry</PERSON> said. He said engineers
replaced the faulty contents of that computer's memory with a
rewritten version that was radioed to the spacecraft <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s main computer found ``something was not kosher'' in
the backup computer's memory and, as a result, assumed <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was
pointing in the wrong direction _ which it wasn't, <PERSON>Sherry</PERSON> said.
That made <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> try to turn to what it thought was the correct
position, but it actually turned its antenna away from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,
losing contact.
   The series of malfunctions ``have shaken the spacecraft, but the
overall spacecraft remains very healthy, and we're very optimistic
we'll be back to a fruitful mission soon,'' <PERSON>Sherry</PERSON> said.

   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will resume making pictures of
Venus on <DATE>Nov. 7</DATE> or 8 after engineers fix a computer programming
flaw that is causing a wobble in the spacecraft's twin solar power
panels, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   Meanwhile, a Soviet scientist working on the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project
praised the American mission, but said more spacecraft should be
sent to Venus to better learn how the planet works geologically.
   ``<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is a beautiful mission. But this is not the end,''
geologist <PERSON>Alexander Basilevsky</PERSON> said during a weekly briefing on
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s closed-circuit television system.
   Basilevsky works for the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences' Vernadsky
Institute of Geochemistry</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Analytical Chemistry</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>. He is
one of three Soviet guest investigators on the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> temporarily suspended its <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY> mapmaking
mission <DATE>Friday</DATE> because of the solar panel problem and because its
communications with <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> were being impaired by a lineup of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>,
the sun and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Engineers determined that a flaw in the spacecraft's computer
software was causing the wobble, said <PERSON>Steve Wall</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
experiment representative at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   They problem should be fixed in time to resume mapping <DATE>Nov. 7</DATE> or
8, when the planetary alignment will no longer hinder
communications, <PERSON>Wall</PERSON> said.
   The solar panels are essential for recharging <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s
batteries to keep the spacecraft running. But the wobbling hasn't
hurt their ability to gather solar energy.
   The orbiter was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>May 4,
1989</DATE>.
   At <TIME>9 p.m. EST</TIME> <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, the sun will be almost directly between
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>. That lineup started hindering <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s
communications with <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> more than a week ago.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> uses radar to penetrate <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' thick clouds to make
pictures and maps. It will map at least <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of
the planet's surface.
   Since mapping formally started <DATE>Sept. 15</DATE>, the orbiter has made
pictures of numerous volcanoes, huge solidified lava flows,
extensive quake faults, Los Angeles-sized meteorite impact craters
and 600-mile-wide, mile-high bulges created as molten rock pushes
upward from inside the planet.

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers today struggled to
restore radio contact with <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> after losing touch with the
Venus-orbiting spacecraft for the second time in five days.
   Space agency engineers' failure <TIME>this morning</TIME> to hear from
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> after the link broke indicated the craft's computerized
emergency systems didn't immediately activate to help re-establish
communication with <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   So the engineers at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory repeatedly
sent new computer commands toward <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s presumed position
around <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> in an attempt to tell it to radio Earth, said <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
spokesman <PERSON>Bob MacMillin</PERSON>.
   Nothing was heard hours after the commands should have elicited
a response from <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>. Engineers met to plan their next step.
   ``Bad news. Nothing. Not a peep out of it,'' <PERSON>MacMillin</PERSON> said.
``It's kind of a mystery.''
   Contact was lost at <TIME>7:03 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> while <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> was tracking
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> with an antenna dish near <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, said
laboratory spokesman <PERSON>Jim Doyle</PERSON>.
   The latest blow to <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY> mission to map <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>
came <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, <TIME>less than eight hours after</TIME> the space agency
released the craft's first snapshots of Venus.
   The pictures revealed a remarkably violent landscape shaped by
impact craters, quake faults, vast lava flows, and ridges and
valleys like those in the western <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   The loss of <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> would be another major blow to <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>, which
grounded the space shuttle fleet temporarily because of fuel leaks
and found the <ORGANIZATION>Hubble Space Telescope</ORGANIZATION> was impaired by a flawed
mirror.
   The spacecraft's emergency systems allowed engineers to locate
the spacecraft on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, more than 14 hours after they lost
contact with it the first time. Eight hours later, they restored
steady contact by sending <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> a command to stop spinning and
keep one of its antennas pointed at <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s mission is to map up to <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' surface
using radar to peer through the planet's thick clouds, which
prevent the use of optical cameras. The spacecraft went into orbit
around <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE> after a roundabout, 948-million-mile trip.
It was launched from the shuttle <DATE>Atlantis 15 months ago</DATE>.
   When <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s first Venus pictures were released <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project manager <PERSON>Tony Spear</PERSON> said that as far as engineers
could tell, ``the spacecraft is healthy,'' despite last week's
malfunction.
   He and other engineers said they still hadn't figured out the
cause of the problem. But Spear had been optimistic enough to say
he still planned to have <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> start its Venus mapping mission
the <DATE>first week of September</DATE>.
   Jet <ORGANIZATION>Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> is known for its ability to overcome
problems with wayward spacecraft. After the twin Voyager probes
were launched in <DATE>1977</DATE>, one lost contact with Earth for eight days.
The radio link was restored and the probes went on to explore the
outer planets.
   Spacecraft system engineer <PERSON>John Slonski</PERSON> said one leading theory
to explain last week's loss of contact with <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was that a
cosmic ray or a high-energy particle from the sun caused a blip in
its computer memory.
   ``We're not ruling out a software flaw or some hardware
problem'' or perhaps some unknown electrical fields surrounding
<LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION> said.
   He also said cosmic ray ``hits'' on spacecraft electronics can
be expected to interfere with <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> about once each year.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> made its first pictures of Venus during a test
conducted just before <DATE>last week</DATE>'s malfunction.
   As promised by <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s first pictures are 10 times more
detailed than the best radar images of Venus made by two Soviet
probes and a giant radio telescope in <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>. They show
details as small as 400 feet across.
   The pictures show ``Venus is intensely fractured and faulted,''
with at least part of its terrain shaped by geological forces
``even more violent than I imagined before,'' <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project
scientist <PERSON>Steve Saunders</PERSON> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   The pictures cover a small portion of the planet near
Hawaii-like volcanic highlands.
   The pictures show plains covered by six- to 10-mile-wide lava
flows that solidified and then were cracked by faults. <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON>
said the flows resemble those in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> or along the <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Snake</ORGANIZATION> rivers in the <LOCATION>Pacific Northwest</LOCATION>.
   Also visible are a couple of volcanic cinder cones, a
20-mile-wide meteorite crater and long, parallel sets of two- to
three-mile-wide valleys and ridges that look like the basins and
ranges of <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said.

   Geologists may get a glimpse of what
<ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s surface was like a few billion years ago when the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
spacecraft's radar pierces the clouds of Venus to reveal secrets of
an alien terrain.
   ``Venus is the last of the inner planets we are exploring in
detail, and probably is the most important from the point of view
of understanding the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Jim Head</PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> science team and a geology professor at <ORGANIZATION>Brown University</ORGANIZATION>
in <LOCATION>Providence</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>R.I.</LOCATION>
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> fired its braking rocket and slipped into orbit around
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> after a 15-month, 948-million-mile voyage from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Engineers at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory monitored the
spacecraft's health <DATE>Saturday</DATE> so it will be ready by <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE> to use
its radar to peer through thick Venusian clouds and make the most
detailed pictures and maps yet of the planet's landscape.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> entered orbit so smoothly that it used very little
thruster fuel to point it properly while the rocket fired. So
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> weighs more and moves faster than expected, making the low
point in its orbit 183 miles above Venus instead of 171 miles as
planned, said navigation chief <PERSON>John McNamee</PERSON>.
   The orbit is so good that an adjustment maneuver planned for
<DATE>Aug. 28</DATE> will not be needed, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project manager <PERSON>Tony Spear</PERSON>
said <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is designed to study the geology and geography of
<LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, heated to 900 degrees Fahrenheit by a ``greenhouse effect''
gone berserk.
   Venus' high temperature and crushing atmospheric pressure might
make rock in the planet's crust much thinner and more flexible than
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s, <PERSON>Head</PERSON> said.
   So Venus may resemble Earth before our home planet's crust
cooled off and broke into colossal plates. Those plates now drift
across the face of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, moving whole continents and colliding
to uplift mountain ranges and trigger volcanic eruptions and
earthquakes.
   Most of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s original surface was destroyed long ago by
erosion and plate movements, so ``we have grave difficulty
answering fundamental questions about the early history of the
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,'' Head said.
   While <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> is hot, dry and lifeless, ``it is very similar in
size and density and also is the closest planet to the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,'' he
said. ``That means it probably had the most similar conditions when
the planets formed (4.6 billion years ago). So if we want to study
another planet to learn something about the early <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> is a
good candidate.''
   Learning how <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' crust moves and is deformed ``will tell us a
lot more about the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Steve Saunders</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s chief
scientist for <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> may settle debate over competing theories that seek to
explain the creation of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' continent-like highlands, which
include Africa-sized <ORGANIZATION>Aphrodite Terra</ORGANIZATION>, Australia-sized Ishtar Terra
and Hawaii-like Beta Regio.
   Saunders believes ``hot spots'' of rising molten rock created
the highlands, just as hot spots created <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   ``If you could look at a time-lapse movie over billions of
years, it might look like a big pot of thick porridge simmering,'
<PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said, adding <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' crust may feature ``a bunch of big
Hawaiis all over the place.''
   Some other scientists think <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' highlands are big pieces of
crust that solidified first as the planet's initial molten surface
cooled off.
   But Head believes plate movements formed the highlands.
Aphrodite Terra resembles <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s midocean ridges, the undersea
mountain ranges where molten rock emerges to add new material to
the drifting plates of crust.
   Ishtar Terra ``has many of the features that you would expect
where blocks of crust are colliding,'' including volcanoes such as
those along the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> coasts of <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION> and
folded mountain belts such as <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s Himalayas, which were created
because <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> is smashing into <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>.
   Even if the Venusian crust hasn't yet broken into plates, ``we
probably will find faults like the <LOCATION>San Andreas</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>,'' a
pretty sure sign that ``Venusquakes'' shake the second planet from
the sun, <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
   After the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft goes into
orbit around <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE>, it will use radar to map the surface
of the cloud-covered planet. Here is some of what scientists
already know about the second planet from the sun:
   DIAMETER: About 7,520 miles, or <PERCENT>95 percent</PERCENT> as wide as <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>;
sixth largest of the solar system's nine known planets.
   MASS: Venus weighs about <PERCENT>82 percent</PERCENT> as much as <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   ATMOSPHERE: About <PERCENT>97 percent</PERCENT> carbon dioxide, with trace amounts
of nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, water vapor, argon, oxygen, carbon
monoxide, neon, and hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids. The
planet's clouds contain sulfuric acid droplets. The atmosphere
traps heat in a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' that scientists
believe evaporated liquid water long ago, if there ever was any on
the planet. Large fluctuations in sulfur dioxide levels may
indicate that active volcanoes pump the gas into <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' atmosphere.
   SURFACE CONDITIONS: Temperature about 900 degrees Fahrenheit,
hot enough to melt lead, zinc or tin. Crushing atmospheric pressure
90 times that on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s surface, or equivalent to the pressure
2,700 feet beneath the surface of an ocean on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   THE CALENDAR: A day on Venus lasts longer than a year. A
Venusian year _ the time it takes for the planet to orbit the sun _
lasts 225 Earth days. A Venusian day _ the time the planet takes to
spin once on its axis _ lasts 243 Earth days. Venus also has
retrograde rotation, so the sun rises in the west and sets in the
east.
   DISTANCE FROM THE SUN: Venus is the second planet from the sun,
orbiting at a distance of 67.2 million miles. It is closer to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
than any other planet. Other than the sun and moon, <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> is the
brightest object in <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s skies.
   MOONS: None.
   GEOLOGY: Earth-based and spacecraft radar revealed hundreds of
thousands of volcanoes on the Venusian lowlands, although
scientists don't yet know if any are active. Venus also has
meteorite impact craters and continent-like highlands with towering
peaks that dwarf Earth's tallest mountains. Scientists suspect
giant plates of rock may move in <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' crust in a process vaguely
like continental drift on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Venus' surface is about <PERCENT>65 percent</PERCENT>
rolling plains, <PERCENT>27 percent</PERCENT> flat lowlands and <PERCENT>8 percent</PERCENT> highlands
that may be similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s continents.
   GRAVITY: About <PERCENT>89 percent</PERCENT> as strong as on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   MAGNETIC FIELD: None detected so far, suggesting <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> now lacks
a liquid core, which is needed to generate a magnetic field.

   With <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> safely in orbit around
Venus today, exuberant <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers started preparing the
spacecraft for a mapping mission meant to reveal what forces shaped
the landscape of the hellishly hot planet.
   ``We think we'll see lots of rocky surfaces, hills and dales and
volcanoes,'' said <PERSON>Bill Johnson</PERSON>, chief engineer for <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s radar
imaging system.
   Geologists hope the <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY> exploration will reveal ``the
way the planet works internally, the way mountains are built and
the way volcanoes work,'' said <PERSON>Steve Saunders</PERSON>, chief <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
scientist at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The mapping is set
to start next month.
   On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> plunged over the north pole of <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, fired
its braking rocket and dropped into an elliptical orbit that ranges
from about 171 miles to 5,054 miles above the planet's surface.
   ``We made it!'' said <PERSON>Carolynn Young</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project team
member. ``I had goose bumps from head to toe. It's wonderful.''
   The spacecraft successfully jettisoned the retrorocket <DATE>Friday</DATE>
<TIME>night</TIME>, laboratory spokesman <PERSON>Bob MacMillin</PERSON> said.
   He said engineers' plans for today included monitoring
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s performance and collecting precise information on its
orbit _ details needed for successful mapping.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s arrival at Venus broke a string of bad luck for <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>.
Hydrogen gas leaks have grounded the shuttle fleet temporarily and
a mirror focusing flaw severely impaired the <MONEY>$1.5 billion</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Hubble
Space Telescope</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is equipped with radar designed to peer through the
thick Venusian clouds and unveil the landscape of the second planet
from the sun. On <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE>, it will start mapping by bouncing radar
waves off Venus and capturing the echoes.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said the radar should be able to yield pictures and maps of
about <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of Venus at a level of detail 10 times better than
in images produced by two Soviet Venera spacecraft that were
launched in <DATE>1983</DATE>. It should be able to detect features as small as
about two football fields.
   ``It's like going to the Grand Canyon instead of having someone
tell you about it,'' mission analyst <PERSON>Rob Lock</PERSON> said.
   Magellan project manager <PERSON>Tony Spear</PERSON> said some worthwhile
pictures of Venus' surface may be produced by radar tests that
start next <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, but ``it is most likely in <DATE>September</DATE> ... that
we will get images of sufficient quality.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was launched from the shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>May 4, 1989</DATE>,
starting a roundabout 948-million-mile journey to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>. It met the
planet at a distance of 144 million miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Venus is <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s nearest neighbor other than the moon, and is
similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in size, mass, density and position.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> may reveal similarities and differences between the two
planets, including whether any of Venus' volcanoes are active and
whether its surface features are formed by large-scale movements of
gigantic plates of rocky crust.
   It also will look for signs that the bone-dry planet may have
had oceans before a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' raised its
surface temperature to 900 degrees Fahrenheit. <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> has no ability to determine what caused global warming on
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, but may find clues to when it started.
   <PERSON>Lennard Fisk</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s associate administrator for space science,
called <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s arrival at Venus ``the beginning of one of the
most exciting eras of planetary exploration'' _ a period that
includes upcoming missions to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, Mars, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, asteroids and
comets.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was the first <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> planetary spacecraft launched since
Pioneers 12 and 13 were sent to Venus in <DATE>1978</DATE>, and also the first
launched from a shuttle.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, named for 16th century global circumnavigator
<ORGANIZATION>Ferdinand Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, is 21 feet long and 15 feet wide. After firing
the heavy fuel-filled braking rocket, its 3.7-ton weight dropped to
less than 1.5 tons, <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION> said.

<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft has sent back dazzling new pictures of the surface of 
Venus showing mysterious pancake-like volcanoes and mountains and valleys that 
appear to be covered with gold. 
</P>
<P>
Fool's gold, that is, not the real stuff. The new images were released one day 
after the spacecraft broke communications with Earth for the third time, but 
this time it took only minutes for controllers at the <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> 
in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> to regain control. Magellan project manager <PERSON>Anthony Spear</PERSON> said 
changes in <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s computer software that were radioed to the spacecraft a 
month ago allowed engineers to resume photographing the surface of Venus within 
three orbits, compared to several days of lost time after the two earlier 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers and scientists were delighted <DATE>Friday</DATE> that controllers had been able 
to correct the problem so quickly, and they were absolutely enchanted by the 
images the spacecraft sent back. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, the tortured landscape of Venus -- with its volcanoes, craters, 
mountains and ancient rivers of lava -- is hidden from view, but the radar 
system aboard <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> pierces through the dense clouds that envelop the 
planet. The system produces images that look like shots of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> from a 
high-altitude aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
But the scene on Venus is quite different from the blue oceans and green 
forests seen on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Photos released by <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> depict a barren, rugged landscape, pockmarked 
with huge craters and twisted and torn by dynamic forces that have left the 
surface of Venus a weathered and foreboding place. Among the most intriguing 
images is one showing seven pancakes that apparently were formed by a series of 
oozing volcanic eruptions. 
</P>
<P>
The pancakes measure about 15 miles in diameter and are about 2,500 feet tall, 
said <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project scientist <PERSON>Stephen Saunders</PERSON>. They are startling in their 
near-perfect symmetry, and they stretch across the Venusian landscape like 
cookies dropped on a tin plate. 
</P>
<P>
The photo of the pancakes, like the thousands of other images being created at 
<ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> from narrow strips of data collected as <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> glides around the planet, 
should help scientists sort out the history of Venus and the dynamic processes 
that are still reshaping the planet that is most like the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said scientists hope to learn something about the consistency of the 
magma that lies beneath the Venusian surface by studying the tidy string of 
volcanic pancakes. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> continues to turn up mysteries as well as answers to questions that 
have troubled scientists for years. For example, some of the images show great 
fields and mountain slopes that appear to be covered with snow. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like snow, but we are talking about (a surface temperature) of 700 
degrees Fahrenheit, so it certainly isn't ice," said <PERSON>Gordon H. Pettengill</PERSON> of 
the <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>, principal investigator for radar 
science. 
</P>
<P>
To investigate this, <PERSON>Pettengill</PERSON> used <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s radar to measure the radiation 
emitted by the surface of the planet. The "emission," as it is called, depends 
mostly on the composition of the surface, and it offers clues to the chemical 
nature of the material on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the "emissivity" of the areas that look as though they are covered 
with snow, <PERSON>Pettengill</PERSON> believes the substance is most likely iron pyrite, also 
known as fool's gold. 
</P>
<P>
But that answers one question while posing another. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know where it comes from," if indeed it is iron pyrite, he said. On 
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, the material is associated with volcanic activity, and <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> has plenty 
of volcanoes, but normally water is also required. Pettengill suggested that 
the material may form on Venus in the absence of water because of the high 
temperatures on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> images also show what appear to be enormous riverbeds winding 
through the hills. But these were never rivers like those on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. They were 
once rivers of molten lava, so hot that it burned its way into the surface as 
it flowed for hundreds of miles, creating scars across a landscape that is void 
of life. 
</P>
<P>
So far, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> has covered more than <PERCENT>18%</PERCENT> of the surface of Venus, an area 
roughly equivalent to all of <LOCATION>North and South America</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect to get something like <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> of the planet" in the first phase of the 
operation, said <PERSON>Spear</PERSON>, the project manager. That is even better than the goal 
of <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT> set before the mission began <DATE>Sept. 15</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
A second phase is to begin <DATE>May 1</DATE>, during which <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will continue to map 
the surface of Venus as the planet spins within the spacecraft's polar orbit. 
JPL, which manages the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> program, is run by <ORGANIZATION>Caltech</ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION>National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Spear said <DATE>Friday</DATE> that it is still not known for certain why the spacecraft has 
severed communications with <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> three times, but the leading candidate is 
electronic "noise" somewhere in the system. 
</P>
<P>
Every now and then, <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION> said, the noise overwhelms the system and "zaps the 
computer." At that point, the craft turns its largest antenna away from Earth 
"and stares at the weeds," he said.

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> is investigating the possibility
that <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> keeps losing touch with <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> because its braking
rocket might not have fully separated after the spacecraft reached
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, engineers said <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> released new photographs from <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> that
showed a lava-filled, 20-mile-wide meteorite crater on the planet.
   Magellan project manager <PERSON>Tony Spear</PERSON> said another theory for the
lapses in radio contact is that the braking rocket pulled some
cables off or burned some cables as it was jettisoned when the
spacecraft went into orbit around <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE>.
   The braking rocket, which slowed <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> so it could enter
orbit, was supposed to separate nine hours later, and most signs
are that it did so or at least started to do so, <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION> said during
a news conference at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``I believe personally the solid rocket motor is far away and
not bumping'' the craft, he said.
   But the possibility it didn't must be considered, said <PERSON>Frank
McKinney</PERSON>, program manager for <ORGANIZATION>Martin Marietta Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which built
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``It's a possibility we're investigating,'' said spacecraft
system engineer <PERSON>John Slonski</PERSON>.
   Two hours after the news conference ended, the laboratory's
public relations office issued a statement saying there was
``currently no doubt the separation was complete.'' Spokesmen
refused to elaborate when asked to explain the contradiction
between that statement and those made by Slonski during the news
conference.
   Even if the rocket had not completely separated, it wouldn't
prevent <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> from conducting its <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY> mission to use
radar to make maps and pictures, <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION> said. Mapping is likely to
start no earlier than mid-September, two weeks later than planned,
he said.
   Magellan first lost radio contact with controllers on <DATE>Aug. 16</DATE>.
Until engineers identify and fix the problem that cut the radio
link, <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION> said, ``I think it's likely to happen again.''
   If so, engineers are ready with new computer commands to ``kick
start'' <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s automatic safety systems and make the spacecraft
re-establish contact with Earth immediately, <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Pictures released <DATE>Friday</DATE>, including a computer-processed
three-dimensional view, showed a meteorite impact crater that has a
very smooth floor and a central peak.
   The smooth floor indicates the crater was flooded by volcanic
lava, either because the meteorite punched through <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' hot, thin
crust, or because the impact created cracks that let lava ooze into
the crater at some later time, said <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> chief scientist <PERSON>Steve
Saunders</PERSON>. He said he favors the second theory.
   The crater first was observed by the Soviet Venera 15 and 16
spacecraft in the mid-1980s. Their pictures were 10 times less
detailed and couldn't determine if it was an impact crater or
created purely by volcanic eruption, <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said.
   He said the crater is relatively young geologically: 100 million
to 150 million years old. It is named after Soviet sculptor <PERSON>Anna
Golubkina</PERSON>, who lived from <DATE>1864</DATE> to <DATE>1927</DATE>.
   Other pictures from <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> showed intense ``Venusquake''
faulting, lava flows and a network of intersecting ridges and
valleys.
   Scientists also displayed a three-minute videotape assembled
from still pictures. It provides a Magellan-eye view of Venus as
the spacecraft swept over the planet.
   Contact with <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was lost for more than 14 hours starting
<DATE>Aug. 16</DATE> and for 17{ hours starting <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   ``My heart can't stand this 17-hour loss of signal'' again,
<ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION> said. ``There are moments of terror and of great happiness
after we recovered the signal.''
   Engineers also are considering the possibility the
communications failures were caused by problems with <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s
computer hardware or programs, or the unlikely chance <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is
being affected by previously unknown electrical fields around <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   ``Possibly we're making a scientific discovery, but this is a
hard way of doing it,'' <PERSON>Spear</PERSON> said.
   Evidence suggests that during its second radio outage, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
wobbled back and forth ``at a high rate,'' using 5.7 pounds of fuel
as its thrusters kept firing, <PERSON>Slonski</PERSON> said. That still leaves 251
pounds of fuel, far more than needed to keep <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> in orbit for
years longer than originally planned. The spacecraft used much less
thruster fuel than expected when it slipped into orbit.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was launched from the shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>May 4, 1989</DATE>,
and traveled a looping 948 million-mile route to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.

<HEAD>Venus Has Surface Bulges Created by Molten Rock</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Venus has 600-mile-wide circular bulges
on its surface caused by molten rock pressing up from inside the
planet, the same kind of forces that created <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
scientist says.
   The bulges are as much as a mile high, said <PERSON>Ellen Stofan</PERSON>, a
geologist who analyzes the spacecraft's pictures of Venus at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``You have hot material that rises from deep within the interior
of the planet,'' pushing up overlying rock, she said. The process
``happens over scales of hundreds of millions of years,'' she said
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   From a bird's-eye-view, the bulges look like sets of concentric
rings. The rings on the bulges are ridges and valleys. Numerous
volcanoes and lava flows dot the bulges, which are called coronas.
   <PERSON>Stofan</PERSON> said the bulges are formed by the same kind of upwelling
of molten rock that created the <LOCATION>Hawaiian Islands</LOCATION>.
   On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> orbited <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> for the 551st time since
arriving at the planet <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE>.
   It has used its picture-making radar to peer through <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>'
thick clouds during 288 of those orbits since mapping started <DATE>Sept.
15</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was launched from space shuttle Atlantis in <DATE>May 1989</DATE>.
   About 30 of the coronas were found on Venus by the Soviet Venera
15 and 16 orbiters in <DATE>1983</DATE> and <DATE>1984</DATE>. But the Venera spacecraft
couldn't determine if they were bulges or depressions caused by
gargantuan meteorites.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is examining the planet with a more sophisticated radar
that makes much more detailed pictures and can also calculate
surface topography.

relatively recently," Wood told a news conference <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> as the <ORGANIZATION>National
Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> released pictures taken by radar cameras
on the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> space probe. He said "recently" could mean the past few
years.;   From earlier images, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> scientists had concluded that there
had been a huge recent landslide on Venus. If that were the case, the planet
would still be geologically active, complete with <PERSON>Venus quakes.</PERSON>;   But project
scientist <PERSON>Steve Saunders</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> said
most investigators have changed their mind. They now feel that the
before-and-after appearance of the "landslide" may just have been a radar
fluke, he said. "We still feel it's somewhat ambiguous," he said.;   Most of
the surface material on Venus is neither rock nor the same material that
erupted from volcanoes, said Wood. It is covered with material that has
weathered into soil in the planet's warm, chemically reactive atmosphere for
millions or hundreds of millions of years. That soil is quite different from
materials in the original rock.;   At low altitudes on the windswept planet,
the temperature is about 170 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than it is on
elevations. One mineral, an iron sulfide, appears in soils only at altitudes
greater than three miles and its presence increases the radar reflectivity.;  
"If weathering is what produces the mineral that makes the other peaks
radar-bright, the most obvious answer is that the summit of <PERSON>Maat Mons</PERSON> has not
been weathered," Wood said. "Why? Most likely because it hasn't had time to be
weathered.";   He said the volcanic eruption may have happened within the <DATE>last
few years.</DATE>;   The <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> has mapped <PERCENT>92 percent</PERCENT> of the surface of Venus,
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s nearest neighbor planet. It completed its first eight-month cycle on
<DATE>May 15</DATE> and now is in its second tour of mapping the entire planet, with its
camera viewing the surface from a slightly different angle.;   "We now have a
better global map of Venus than we have of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>," said Saunders.;   By
combining the images, scientists have produced three-dimensional views and by
feeding data into computers created a stunning low-level aerial tour of the
planet.;   "We see the face of a new planet," <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said. While Soviet and
American space probes have studied <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> since <DATE>1962</DATE>, "in that time we've never
known what the planet looks like," he said.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   A bedeviled, beleaguered <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> is hoping
the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft's rendezvous with <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> next month will
provide our best look yet at <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s hellishly hot neighbor.
   If all goes according to plan, the <MONEY>$413 million</MONEY> unmanned device,
centerpiece of a <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY> mission, will orbit the
cloud-shrouded planet on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE> after a 15-month journey from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. And <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> desperately wants everything to go according to
plan.
   ``This thing must succeed because of the Hubble Space Telescope
effect and the generally bad impression we've all been getting of
how <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> has been conducting its affairs lately,'' said <PERSON>Steve
Saunders</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project's chief scientist.
   But those setbacks _ the crippling of the <MONEY>$1.5 billion</MONEY> Hubble
observatory due to mirror imperfections; the temporary grounding of
the space shuttles due to hydrogen fuel leaks _ have not dimmed the
agency's enthusiasm for <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We've dreamed about the sights we would see. Now it's about to
happen,'' said <PERSON>Phil Allin</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project official at the
<ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Named for 16th century explorer <ORGANIZATION>Ferdinand Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, the craft's
radar will penetrate acid-laden Venusian clouds to make pictures
and maps 10 times more detailed than the best previous images.
   That will help geologists understand forces that sculpted Venus
to create flat lowlands, hilly plains and continent-like highlands
capped by peaks such as 35,400-foot <PERSON>Mount Maxwell</PERSON>, which is a mile
taller than <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Mount Everest</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> says <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s radar will reveal unprecedented details of
the planet's terrain, a landscape shaped by meteorite craters, tens
of thousands of volcanoes, and perhaps movements of gargantuan
blocks of the planet's crust _ a process that may be similar to
continental drift on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The 3.7-ton spacecraft also will look for ancient shorelines and
channels to learn if Venus once had oceans and rivers, before its
carbon dioxide atmosphere trapped the sun's heat in a runaway
``greenhouse effect.''
   Such global warming makes modern Venus a bone-dry, 900-degree
Fahrenheit oven with an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s mission ``is the capstone of the exploration of the
inner planets,'' said <PERSON>Jim Head</PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> science
team and a geologist at <ORGANIZATION>Brown University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Providence</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>R.I.</LOCATION>
   ``We've seen the surfaces of the moon, Mars, the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> always has been obscured by the clouds and we've
never gotten a good global view of it.''
   The 21-foot-long <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was released from the cargo bay of
space shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>May 4, 1989</DATE>, then launched on its
roundabout, 806 million-mile voyage by an inertial upper-stage
rocket.
   At <TIME>9:31 a.m. PDT</TIME> on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will fire its solid-fueled
Star rocket to slow down and go into a elliptical, nearly polar
orbit that ranges from 171 miles to almost 5,000 miles above <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   After a few weeks of tests, the spacecraft will bounce radar
waves off Venus to make pictures and topographic maps of <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT>
to <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of the surface. Meanwhile, the planet will rotate
once on its axis during a single Venusian day, which equals 243
Earth days.
   ``It's going to give us a map of Venus that in many ways is
better than anything we have for the whole Earth,'' where most of
the ocean floor hasn't been mapped in detail, <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said.
   If scientists are lucky, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> may tell them if Venusian
volcanoes are active, if movements of the planet's crust produce
``Venus quakes,'' and if those movements are more like Earth's
drifting continents or like the upward boiling of molten rock that
created <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>.
   Venus is the planet most like <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in terms of size, density
and mass, and also is <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s nearest neighbor, other than the
moon. Yet its clouds prevent the surface from being seen by
telescopes or optical cameras aboard orbiting spaceships.
   About 20 spacecraft have visited <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> since the early <DATE>1960s</DATE>,
some deploying landers that photographed small parts of the
surface. Pictures also were made by transmitting radar waves from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, and from <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Pioneer Venus orbiter in <DATE>1978</DATE> and the <LOCATION>Soviet
Union</LOCATION>'s Venera 15 and 16 orbiters in <DATE>1983</DATE>.
   But the best radar pictures until now could distinguish only
those landscape features wider than about 1\ miles. <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s pictures will be roughly 10 times better, capturing
features as small as 260 yards, about the length of 2{ football
fields.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will take 3 hours and 11 minutes to orbit Venus once.
During each orbit, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will spend 37 minutes as it moves from
north to south bouncing radar off a swath of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' surface about
10,000 miles long but only 16 miles wide. The information will be
stored on two tape recorders.
   During the rest of each orbit, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will radio the
information back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, where it will be received by
230-foot-wide, dish-shaped antennas at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Deep Space Network</ORGANIZATION>
stations in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.
   Computers at <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> will assemble the data
into pictures and topographic maps of each swath. The swaths _
nicknamed ``noodles'' because they are so long and narrow _ then
will be assembled into pictures covering larger areas of the planet.
   ``Mapping a whole new planet will return an enormous amount of
data that will keep geologists busy for a long time,'' <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON>
said. ``If you printed it in books, it would fill a shelf about 10
miles long. It's very humbling.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s main 243-day mapping mission will miss the south
polar regions. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> is expected to approve more 243-day mapping
cycles. A total of three are needed to map the entire planet.
   Cost of the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> mission through the first 243-day mapping
cycle is <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY>, including the cost of launching the
spacecraft from the shuttle, said <PERSON>Bill Dimmer</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s
comptroller's office in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. The spacecraft and its
instruments account for <MONEY>$413 million</MONEY> of that total, he said.

<HEAD>Magellan Turns Off Radar Because of Computer Errors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ground control computer error prompted
the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft to briefly halt its mapping expedition of
Venus, but <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials said the probe remained in contact with
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The computer glitch occurred <TIME>late Friday night</TIME>. The
multimillion-dollar craft was expected to resume its charting
mission early today, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said in a statement.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> stopped mapping when an onboard computer detected
errors in commands being sent from ground control computers, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
said.
   It was the second report of problems with the craft's mapping
mission in eight days. The <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> signal was lost for 40 minutes
on <DATE>Nov. 15</DATE>. Signals were lost twice in <DATE>August</DATE>.
   Flight controllers said some mapping orbits would be lost, but
the craft did not lose contact with <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Engineers have lost contact with <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> three times for
reasons not yet fully understood, but believed to be electric
static interfering with a spacecraft computer.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was launched from Space Shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>May, 4,
1989</DATE>. It went into orbit around <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE> and formally
started its <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY> mapping mission <DATE>Sept. 15</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> uses radar to map terrain through thick clouds covering
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>. It has sent back pictures of the planet's fractured volcanic
surface, revealing numerous lava flows, volcanoes, quake faults and
Los Angeles-sized meteorite impact craters.

   Engineers lost radio contact with the
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> for the second time in five days,
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Scientists weren't immediately sure if the spacecraft's computer
circuits would send out a radio beam in an attempt to re-establish
communication with <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, as the Venus-orbiting craft is supposed
to do in an emergency, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s mission is to map up to <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' surface
using radar to peer through the planet's thick clouds, which
prevent the use of optical cameras. The spacecraft went into orbit
around <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE> after a roundabout, 948-million-mile trip. It
was launched from the shuttle <DATE>Atlantis 15 months ago</DATE>.
   ``They lost it at <TIME>7:03 p.m.</TIME> PDT'' while tracking the craft with
a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> antenna dish near <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Jim Doyle</PERSON>,
spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   The mishap came only hours after <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> released the spacecraft's
first pictures of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s closest planetary neighbor. They showed
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON> has quake faults, lava flows like those in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>,
and long, parallel valleys and ridges similar to those between the
<LOCATION>Sierra Nevada</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Rockies</ORGANIZATION>.
   The loss of <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, the centerpiece of a <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY> mission
to explore <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, would be a major blow to <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>, which grounded the
shuttle fleet temporarily because of fuel leaks and found the
<ORGANIZATION>Hubble Space Telescope</ORGANIZATION> had a flawed mirror.
   <PERSON>Doyle</PERSON> said that if the craft was beaming radio waves across the
sky while spinning _ as it is supposed to do to in an emergency _
engineers could re-establish intermittent contact between 12:03 and
<TIME>12:30 a.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   Less than seven hours before contact broke off, project manager
<PERSON>Tony Spear</PERSON> said that as far as engineers could tell, ``the
spacecraft is healthy,'' despite a loss of contact for more than 14
hours starting <DATE>last Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   The spacecraft's automatic self-protection system made <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
re-establish with <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers last <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>. Then, they
sent <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> a command to make it stop spinning and stay in touch
with <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Engineers said they still haven't figured out why they lost
contact with <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> last week.
   One leading theory is that a cosmic ray or a high-energy
particle from the sun caused a blip in <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s computer memory,
said spacecraft system engineer <PERSON>John Slonski</PERSON>.
   ``We're not ruling out a software flaw or some hardware
problem'' or perhaps some unknown electrical fields surrounding
<LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Cosmic ray ``hits'' on spacecraft electronics can be expected to
interfere with <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> about once each year, <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION> said. Similar
events occasionally have disrupted the Pioneer <PERSON>Venus Orbiter</PERSON>,
launched in <DATE>1978</DATE>, and the Tracking and <ORGANIZATION>Data Relay Satellites</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbit, <PERSON>Slonski</PERSON> said.
   The pictures released <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> were taken during an <DATE>Aug. 16</DATE> test
when <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> bounced its radar beam off Venus for the first time.
   As promised by <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>, the pictures are 10 times more detailed
than the best radar images of Venus made by the Soviet Venera 15
and 16 spacecraft and by the radio telescope at <LOCATION>Arecibo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Puerto
Rico</LOCATION>. They show details as small as 400 feet across, or a third
bigger than the length of a football field.
   The large number of fractures and ``Venusquake'' faults seen in
images from the spacecraft suggest the crustal movements that
shaped the landscape are ``perhaps even more violent than I
imagined before,'' said <PERSON>Steve Saunders</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s chief scientist
at <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Overlapping lava flows of various ages'' and six to 10 miles
wide appear as bright and dark splotches, he said.
   But <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said the pictures don't yet show any of Venus'
major volcanoes, whether any of them are active or if the planet's
crust is broken into the kind of drifting plates that carry whole
continents across the face of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Previous spacecraft
revealed numerous mountainous volcanoes.
   The lava flows are ``similar geologically to volcanic deposits
seen on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> at <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Snake River Plains</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
said in a statement.
   The parallel sets of elongated valleys and ridges resemble those
in the basin-and-range province of the intermountain region of <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>, or at the <ORGANIZATION>Great Rift Valley</ORGANIZATION> in eastern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. They
show that at least part of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' crust has been stretched apart,
<PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said.

   A runaway ``greenhouse effect'' has
eliminated any trace of water. Volcanoes number not in the hundreds
or thousands, but the hundreds of thousands. Its crushing
atmospheric pressure, suffice it to say, could never support
anything resembling human life.
   Venus is not exactly <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>.
   For eight months beginning in <DATE>August 1990</DATE>, the space probe
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will circle the second planet from the Sun, using
computer-enhanced radar images to study a planet so inhospitable
that its 900-degree surface temperature would melt lead.
   Yet, for all its alien qualities, scientists think the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
mission will yield valuable information about the formation of
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   ``The most likely scenario is that we'll find something that
will completely astound and baffle us,'' said <PERSON>Steve Saunders</PERSON>,
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s chief scientist at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>. The craft was being ferried into space aboard the shuttle
Atlantis, to be launched from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbit on its 15-month
trajectory to <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>.
   Pictures from <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> should help scientists deduce ``the
probability you're going to find Earth-like planets _ and life _
somewhere else,'' said geologist <PERSON>Laurence Soderblom</PERSON>, a scientist
working on the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project.
   Peering through acid-laden clouds, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> should give
scientists their best look yet at a planet so outwardly different
from the garden of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> yet apparently shaped by the same geologic
processes.
   ``Of all the planets in the solar system, <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> is most like our
own Earth in size, mass and distance from the sun,'' <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> says.
   Among the common forces, scientists say, are volcanic eruptions,
meteorite impacts and, perhaps, continental drift, the evolutionary
movement of huge land masses. <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will also look for evidence
of wind and water erosion and test the bounds of Venus' gravity.
   The image of Venus formed by pictures taken from earlier <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
and Soviet space probes is of a planet where molten rock lies so
close to the solid crust surface that impacting meteorites might
produce volcanic eruptions, where hundreds of thousands of
volcanoes stretch for thousands of miles across lowland plains,
where continent-sized highlands sprout mountains dwarfing <ORGANIZATION>Everest</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, once it begins orbiting Venus on <DATE>Aug. 10, 1990</DATE>, will
look for ancient stream channels, shorelines and other evidence the
planet once may have had oceans. Scientists believe an unchecked
``greenhouse effect'' _ in which the carbon dioxide atmosphere
acted like greenhouse glass and trapped solar heat _ raised the
temperature until water disappeared.
   It's a <MONEY>$550-million</MONEY> project with the scientific world watching.
   ``Part of the answer is knowing whether Earth is a fluke or just
one of the natural consequences of the evolution of a generic solar
system,'' said <PERSON>Soderblom</PERSON>, who works for the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION>
in <LOCATION>Flagstaff</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz</LOCATION>.
   Scientists will probe the gravity forces of Venus by plotting
the path of <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> as it swoops to within 155 miles of the
planet's surface and then sweeps out to a high orbit point of 4,977
miles.
   In looking for similarities between <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, scientists
begin by noting that they are roughly the same size, weight and
distance from the Sun, and are both bigger than <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s moon,
<ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION> and Mars.
   Heavenly bodies ``are a lot like potatoes. The big ones stay hot
for a long time, and the little ones cool off quickly,'' said
<PERSON>Saunders</PERSON>, himself a geologist.
   The moon, <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION> and Mars have cold surfaces free of
continental drift. Because a planet's internal heat ``drives the
geological machinery,'' however, scientists believe <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and Earth
both give off heat through volcanic activity and movements of
gargantuan pieces of rock along the planetary crust, <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said.
   Magellan should help scientists learn if any of the Venusian
volcanoes are still erupting and how crustal rock movements differs
from that on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Rock in <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s crust is created and recycled in a conveyor-belt
manner. Hot crustal rock is born along midocean ridges _ undersea
mountain chains thousands of miles long. New crust is pushed away
from these ridges as more rock emerges. The crust eventually
collides with lighter continental rock, such as at the ``subduction
zone'' where Pacific seafloor rock sinks beneath <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>.
   Heat is released as sinking rock melts, creating volcanoes.
   Earth releases most of its heat at midocean ridges and
subduction zones. Saunders and <PERSON>Gerald Schaber</PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION>USGS</ORGANIZATION>
geologist, believe <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> loses its internal heat mostly through
``hot spot'' volcanoes.
   On <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, such volcanoes form where molten rock rises through
thin parts of the crust, such as in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>. But there's evidence
that <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> has crustal movement similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and that the
volcanic ranges may be the Venusian equivalent of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s midocean
ridges.
   No one yet has found conclusive evidence of subduction zones on
Venus. In places, however, folded mountains and valleys are
squeezed up against <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' continent-like highlands, Aphrodite and
Ishtar, the latter of which has mountains taller than <ORGANIZATION>Everest</ORGANIZATION>.
   These regions look something like <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Himalayas</LOCATION>, mountains
formed when <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> smashed into <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. So crustal movements on <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>
may be ``thin-skinned,'' forming folded mountains without large
chunks of crustal rock diving deep into the planet, <PERSON>Schaber</PERSON> said.
   If large plates of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' crustal rock are in motion, ``you can
bet there's Venusquakes,'' he added.

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> says <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY>
mission to map the rugged surface of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> will begin later this
month even if engineers can't figure out why they twice lost radio
contact with the spacecraft.
   ``We're not willing to wait to understand what happened,''
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> experiment representative <PERSON>Steve Wall</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet
<ORGANIZATION>Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   Magellan went into orbit around <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE> after a
looping, 948-million-mile trip that began when the spacecraft was
launched from the shuttle <DATE>Atlantis 16 months ago</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> made its first pictures of Venus during an <DATE>Aug. 16</DATE> test
but lost touch with <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> <TIME>that night</TIME> for 14 hours and lost contact
again for 17{ hours starting <DATE>Aug. 21</DATE>.
   Engineers will continue trying to determine the cause of the
failures, but computer commands being sent to <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> should
enable engineers to restore contact quickly if it is lost again,
<PERSON>Wall</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is designed to use radar to peer through <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' thick
clouds and make the most detailed maps and pictures yet of the
planet's deformed surface. The communications trouble delayed the
start of mapping last week.
   Officials expect to start the mapping sometime late this month,
<PERSON>Wall</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> are about 153 million miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The spaceship's initial pictures showed long faults, other areas
crisscrossed by many faults in a pattern resembling broken
automobile safety glass, solidified lava flows, volcanic cinder
cones, meteorite impact craters and extensive valleys and ridges.

<TEXT>
   Here are some unusual facts about the
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft and <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, culled from ``The Magellan Venus
Explorer's Guide'' and other <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> publications:
   _Getting <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> required three main engines and two
rockets on the shuttle Atlantis that carried it into Earth orbit,
two rockets on the inertial upper-stage booster that hurled it
toward <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, and one braking rocket to slow it down for entry into
orbit around <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>. But for <PERCENT>99 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s
948-million-mile trip to <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, it cruised without power.
   _Venus is named for the Roman goddess of love. It's
continent-like highlands are named after Aphrodite, the Greek love
goddess, and Ishtar, the Baylonian love goddess.
   _Temperatures and pressures on Venus are equivalent to
conditions inside a 900-degree Fahrenheit self-cleaning oven 3,000
feet below the surface of an ocean on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   _<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will collect and send to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> more computerized
information than the combined total from all previous <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> missions
to other planets.
   _After about a dozen years, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will lack enough propellant
to fire its thrusters and maintain its orbit. The orbit will decay
and the spacecraft eventually will plunge into the Venusian
atmosphere and burn up.
   _When <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> uses its radar to map <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' landscape, it will
consume 200 watts of electricity, about the same as a bright floor
lamp.
   _If <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> flew over <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Mount St. Helens</LOCATION> volcano, it
could recognize it as a mountain. The radars on Soviets' Venera 15
and 16 spacecraft, which were launched in <DATE>1983</DATE>, wouldn't be able to
distinguish <ORGANIZATION>Mount St. Helens</ORGANIZATION> from a meteorite impact crater.
   _The <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> named two craters on Venus after teacher
<PERSON>Sharon McAuliffe</PERSON> and astronaut <PERSON>Judith Resnick</PERSON>, who were among seven
crew members killed when Challenger exploded after liftoff in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   _When <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> fired its braking rocket to start orbiting <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>
on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, the spacecraft experienced a maximum force seven times
the force of gravity on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   _During each orbit around <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will travel about
38,314 miles as an average speed of 12,163 mph.

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> armed <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s rocket <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>,
preparing the spacecraft to orbit <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> for a <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY> mission
to take the best radar pictures yet of the surface of the
cloud-covered planet.
   The agency has recently been embarrassed by a mirror defect that
crippled the <MONEY>$1.5 billion</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Hubble Space Telescope</ORGANIZATION> and hydrogen leaks
that temporarily grounded the space shuttle fleet.
   So engineers at <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> are intent on making
sure the unmanned <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> successfully fires its rocket <DATE>Friday</DATE> to
go into near-polar orbit around <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   If all goes well, engineers will spend most of the month testing
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s radar and making adjustments. Sometime between <DATE>Aug. 26</DATE>
and <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will start formal use of its radar to peer
through thick Venusian clouds and map the planet.
   ``I'm able to sleep as long as I don't drink caffeine, but I
suspect I'm going to be very nervous'' until <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is safely in
orbit, said <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project manager <PERSON>Tony Spear</PERSON>. ``It's like your
life can go either one direction or another, so I don't plan after
<DATE>Friday</DATE> right now.''
   The 3.7-ton <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was released from the cargo bay of the
shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>May 4, 1989</DATE>, then fired an inertial upper-stage
booster rocket to launch it on a looping, 948-million-mile trip to
the second planet from the sun.
   Engineers received a radio signal from <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>
indicating the spacecraft successfully completed an electronic
circuit to arm a solid-fuel Star rocket, <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION> said.
   At <TIME>9:32 a.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE>, a computer program will automatically
order the rocket to fire for 83 seconds. The rocket, firing
forward, will reduce <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s speed from 24,600 mph to about
18,600 mph. That will allow <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> to be captured by <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>'
gravity into an orbit ranging from 171 miles to almost 5,000 miles
above the planet.
   The spacecraft will be behind <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> when the rocket ignites, and
won't emerge from <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' shadow until about <TIME>9:54 a.m.</TIME> Radio signals
from <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> take almost 13 minutes to reach <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. So it will be
about <TIME>10:07 a.m. PDT</TIME> when engineers receive a radio signal
indicating <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is in orbit.
   If they receive the signal five minutes early, that will mean
the rocket didn't fire and <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is speeding past Venus in
another major failure for the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION>.
   But Spear is optimistic the mission will work.
   ``We trust our spacecraft,' he said. ``It's demonstrated it
knows how to take instructions.''
   At midmorning <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was 519,095 miles from <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>
and 143 million miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. It was traveling at 10,189 mph,
increasing speed as it was tugged by Venusian gravity.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will be able to detect Venusian surface features larger
than the length of about 2{ football fields. So its pictures will
be about 10 times more detailed than the best pictures obtained by
radars on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> or aboard some of the two dozen spacecraft that
have visited the planet before.
   Venus is <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s nearest neighbor other than the moon, and the
two planets are similar in size and density. <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> may reveal
whether the two planets also have similar geological processes,
including movements of gargantuan plates of shifting crustal rock.
   It also may detect evidence of ``Venusquakes,'' determine if any
of the planet's tens of thousands of volcanoes are erupting, and
learn if <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> had oceans before a runaway ``greenhouse effect''
raised its surface temperature to 900 degrees Fahrenheit.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s prime mission is to map <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of
the planet during the first 243-day cycle, equal to one <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> day.
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> is expected to approve continued operation. Three 243-day
mapping cycles are needed to map the entire planet.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s comptroller's office says the total cost of the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
mission is <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY>, including <MONEY>$413 million</MONEY> for the spacecraft
and its instruments.

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s mission to map <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> has been
delayed again, until late <DATE>September</DATE>, while <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> tries to figure out
why the spacecraft keeps losing touch with <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   ``Have patience with us. We're going to make it work,'' <PERSON>Tony
Spear</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project manager at the space agency's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s radio link to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> failed for 14 hours starting <DATE>Aug.
16</DATE> and for 17{ hours beginning <DATE>Aug. 21</DATE>, while the craft was in
orbit around <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>.
   Spear said he organized a team of 40 engineers from the lab and
from <ORGANIZATION>Martin Marietta Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which built <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>, to
determine what is wrong with the spacecraft and fix it.
   Before <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> started malfunctioning, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> planned for it to
make pictures and maps of Venus on a regular basis starting
<DATE>Saturday</DATE>. Last week, <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION> said engineers hoped to have <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
working properly by mid-September.
   Now, he said, ``We're targeting for the <DATE>last week</DATE> in <DATE>September</DATE>
to start mapping.''
   Mapping is being delayed not only to fix <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> but also
because the craft's troubles have left engineers ``mentally and
physically exhausted,'' <PERSON>Spear</PERSON> said. ``We've decided to give the
team three days off around Labor Day.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY> mission is to use radar to peer through
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' thick clouds and make the best pictures and maps yet of the
planet's surface. The spacecraft was launched from space shuttle
Atlantis in <DATE>May 1989</DATE>.
   Pictures made during an <DATE>Aug. 16</DATE> test showed quake faults, vast
solidified lava flows, cinder cones, a lava-filled meteorite impact
crater and countless valleys and mountain ridges on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s nearest
planetary neighbor.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> functioned almost flawlessly during the 15 months it
traveled a looping, 948-million-mile route to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>. One major
theory is that something went wrong when the craft went into orbit
around <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> also has been troubled by the temporary grounding of the
shuttle fleet and a focusing flaw on the <ORGANIZATION>Hubble Space Telescope</ORGANIZATION>.
   Spear said engineeers will try to determine if previously
unknown electrical fields or particles around <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> are disrupting
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s electronics.
   The engineers will also examine a computer that ran amok during
the communications failures and look at changes in <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> as it
went into orbit, including the possibility of short circuits.
   Spear ruled out the possibility, raised <DATE>Friday</DATE>, that <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s
braking rocket may have failed to separate from the spacecraft
after it went into orbit.

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials hope that a
disassembled spacecraft sitting in crates at a hangar <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>
will be en route to Venus by <DATE>April</DATE> as <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s first
interplanetary explorer in 11 years.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> showed off the
scattered pieces of the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft to reporters and
photographers four days after the spacecraft's arrival by truck
from the <ORGANIZATION>Martin Marietta</ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>.
   If all goes well, the parts will be assembled and checked out
over the next few months and then transported to the launch pad in
<DATE>March</DATE> to be loaded aboard the space shuttle Atlantis, said <PERSON>Jo Ann
Morgan</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space Center</ORGANIZATION>'s director of payloads projects
management.
   The scheduled launch date is <DATE>April 28</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> will have only 25 days, until <DATE>May 23</DATE>, to get Atlantis off
the pad before <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> moves out of its favorable alignment with
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Otherwise the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> voyage will have to be delayed about
two years, said <PERSON>Charles Brown</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> program manager for <ORGANIZATION>Martin
Marietta</ORGANIZATION>, which built the probe for <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Once the shuttle is in orbit, the crew will release <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
from the cargo bay and a rocket will start it on the 466-day trip
to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   It will be the first planetary probe launched from a shuttle as
well as the first <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> planetary mission since two Pioneer
spacecraft were dispatched in <DATE>1978</DATE> to study <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' atmosphere.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is to settle into an elliptical orbit around <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>
ranging from 155 miles to 1,180 miles above the surface. Each
circuit of the planet will take 3.1 days, and during the 40 minutes
the craft is nearest the surface, an advanced radar will peer
through the constant cloud layer and obtain images of the surface,
which will be relayed to an <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> station.
   During each orbit, the radar, supplied by <ORGANIZATION>Hughes Aircraft Co.</ORGANIZATION>,
will map a swath of surface 15 miles wide and 10,000 miles long.
<PERSON>Brown</PERSON> said it would take 1,853 such swaths, recorded over 243 days,
to chart the entire planet.
   ``The spacecraft will be conducting basic research about how
Venus was formed,'' <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> told a news conference. ``To find out, we
need to know the topography of the planet.
   ``We now have the topography of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, the moon, Mars and
<ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION>, but we don't have the topography of Venus because of the
cloud cover,'' he said. ``The imaging radar will give us that
topography.''
   <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will enable scientists for the first time to
study detailed images of Venus like those formed by wind or flowing
liquid, craters and large landslides.
   While Venus is <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s closest neighbor in the solar system, the
two planets are vastly different. Venus has a surface temperature
of about 900 degrees Fahrenheit, its atmopshere is almost entirely
carbon dioxide, and its atmospheric pressure is 90 times that of
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> said one goal of the mission is to try to learn why the
two planets evolved so differently.

<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft has sent back its first snapshots of <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, revealing a 
planet ripped and shredded by powerful stresses that appear far more pervasive 
than the tectonic forces that generate great earthquakes and catastrophic 
volcanoes on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The radar camera aboard the spacecraft, which pierces the layers of dense 
clouds that normally hide the surface of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, snapped a series of long, 
narrow images of the planet. Everywhere the camera looked it found giant faults 
and evidence of past volcanic activity. 
</P>
<P>
The first images are part of a "test strip" used to check out the spacecraft's 
radar system. They will be followed in the coming months with extensive 
coverage of the planet that is most like the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in size and distance from 
the sun. 
</P>
<P>
Venus' geological history appears "more violent than I had imagined before," 
project scientist <PERSON>Stephen Saunders</PERSON> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> during a press conference at 
the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
during which the first photos were released. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the images were captured, the spacecraft mysteriously lost 
contact with Earth and went into a "safe mode" designed to help reestablish 
communications. The malfunction left scientists at the <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> lab wondering 
for a while if the show was already over. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, only hours after <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> released the first pictures of Venus, <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> 
engineers again lost contact with <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>. "They lost it at <TIME>7:03 p.m.</TIME> PDT" 
while tracking <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> with a <ORGANIZATION>NASA Deep Space Network</ORGANIZATION> antenna dish near 
<LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, said spokesman <PERSON>Jim Doyle</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
They were uncertain whether the spacecraft was going into an automatic 
self-protection routine in which it would send a radio beam across the sky in 
an attempt to re-establish communications with <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Doyle</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
If the spacecraft was beaming radio waves while spinning, as it is supposed to 
do in an emergency, engineers expected to be able to re-establish intermittent 
contact early today. 
</P>
<P>
After losing contact the first time, engineers at the lab established 
communications late <DATE>Friday</DATE>, after a 14-hour blackout, but no one is certain 
what caused the problem. The leading theory, according to engineer <PERSON>John 
Slonski</PERSON>, is that the craft was hit by a cosmic ray or a high-energy particle 
that confused its computer. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, <PERSON>Slonski</PERSON> said all systems aboard the craft appear "healthy," 
and <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is set to begin its scientific exploration of nearly the entire 
surface of Venus early next month. 
</P>
<P>
The craft's radar system will continually scan a narrow band on the planet's 
surface, about 12 miles wide, as <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> orbits between 180 and 1,200 miles 
above ground. The snapshots released <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> covered several short stretches, 
ranging from 50 to 90 miles long, captured during 1 1/2 orbits of the 
blisteringly hot planet, which has a surface temperature of 900 degrees 
Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
Saunders, a planetary geologist, found many features in the images that 
reminded him of places on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, ranging from the <LOCATION>Rocky Mountains</LOCATION> to the 
volcanoes of <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, but he said he had not expected to find so much faulting. 
</P>
<P>
"I am somewhat surprised at the degree of fracturing (from quake-like 
activity)," <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said. "We found it every place we looked." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said the evidence suggests that <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> differs from the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in that 
"Venus quakes" appear to have happened over wide regions, rather than being 
concentrated along the boundaries of giant tectonic plates. On Earth, most 
seismic activity is generated in areas where at least two plates grind against 
each other -- the process that created the <LOCATION>San Andreas Fault</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Saunders cautioned that <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s first glimpse may be misleading. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe, just by happenstance, we started out by looking at one of the most 
active regions on Venus," he said.

<P>
It is a tantalizing and all-too-brief look for scientists who have waited for 
years for <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> to perform. The thousands of images it is programmed to send 
back over the <DATE>next two years</DATE> are expected to be 10 times sharper than radar 
images returned by two Soviet spacecraft in <DATE>1983</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The photos released <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> were "just a crack in the door," <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said. 
"I'm looking down through a narrow slit, and we are seeing things we've never 
seen before." 
</P>
<P>
The images were taken as the spacecraft zipped over a major volcanic area 
called Beta Regio. <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said its structure probably resembles the southern 
<LOCATION>San Andreas Fault</LOCATION> near the <LOCATION>Salton Sea</LOCATION> that is hidden several miles under the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
More "slits" will be scanned over the coming weeks and wedded together into a 
mosaic of the surface of Venus. Scientists hope to be able to draw firm 
conclusions on the geological history and current nature of the planet.

   Commands radioed 152 million miles
across the solar system <DATE>Saturday</DATE> made the errant <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
spacecraft easier to control as it orbits <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet
Propulsion Laboratory said.
   Engineers have not determined why the spacecraft has suffered
two long communications blackouts but were hopeful that its <MONEY>$744
million</MONEY> mission to map the planet with radar would begin this month.
   Controllers began sending commands to <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> early <DATE>Saturday</DATE> to
awaken it from a so-called deep-safe mode and put it in a state
called random access memory control.
   Nearly six hours after beginning the series of orders, the lab
received <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s confirmation of the new configuration.
   Radio signals take 27 minutes, 10 seconds to travel from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and back. Venus is <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s closest planetary neighbor.
   Magellan appeared to be stable, its solar panels were properly
pointed at the sun and its batteries were charged, the lab said in
a statement.
   The new condition will allow flight controllers to more easily
program <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s computers. In addition, data from <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> can
tell engineers more about the spacecraft's condition, said <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION>
spokesman <PERSON>Jim Doyle</PERSON>.
   Next week, engineers will do more to normalize the spacecraft's
operation. If that goes without a hitch, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> would be ordered
on <DATE>Sept. 12</DATE> to send home radar data already stored on its tape
recorder and its radar sensor would resume operation two days later.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was launched from the space shuttle Atlantis in <DATE>May
1989</DATE>, and made a looping, 15-month, 948 million-mile journey to
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   The spacecraft entered orbit around the cloud-shrouded planet
<DATE>Aug. 10</DATE>, and things began to go wrong. The radio link from <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> failed for 14 hours starting <DATE>Aug. 16</DATE> and for 17{ hours
beginning <DATE>Aug. 21</DATE>.
   Controllers put <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> into deep-safe mode, which kept its
solar array pointed toward the sun so its batteries would stay
charged.
   Other spacecraft have passed near <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, but they returned
images far less detailed than <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> can produce.
   Images of Venus sent by <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> after an <DATE>Aug. 16</DATE> test of the
radar-mapping system showed extensive seismic faults, enormous
flows of solidified lava, cinder cones, a meteorite impact crater
filled with lava and innumerable valleys and mountain ridges.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> had originally
planned for <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> to begin its mapping survey by the end of
<DATE>August</DATE>.

   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> sent information to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> today
to help engineers learn why they temporarily lost contact with the
spacecraft after its first pictures displayed quake faults,
volcanic cinder cones and plains made of lava flows on Venus.
   ``After steady contact with the spacecraft was re-established
<DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, engineers commanded the spacecraft to transmit all of
the information in its computer memories back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. This will
continue throughout the <DATE>weekend</DATE>,'' said <PERSON>Mary Beth Murrill</PERSON>,
spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   She said it might take days to figure out why <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> lost
contact with <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> after it sent back its first
test pictures of Venus _ images that had scientists marveling.
   ``The radar works far better than we ever dreamed it would,''
said <PERSON>Steve Saunders</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s chief scientist. ``The kind of
faulting we see would certainly mean there are `Venusquakes.'''
   The pictures will be released <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics
and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> said in a statement issued <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   Before the problem developed, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was scheduled to start
its formal mapping mission <DATE>Aug. 29</DATE>, using its radar to peer through
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' thick clouds. <PERSON>Murrill</PERSON> said a delay is likely, but engineers
haven't yet announced their plans.
   Engineers today continued the process of returning <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> to
normal operation. It lost touch with <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION> for almost 15 hours
starting <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, then continued to go in and out of radio
contact over the next eight hours.
   A computer command sent to <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> restored
steady radio contact at <TIME>7:11 p.m. PDT</TIME>.
   ``We jumped up and clapped,'' said <PERSON>Tommy Thompson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
science operations manager. `It was just like the home team scoring
a touchdown.''
   <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> said engineers expected to remain in touch with
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> except when it swings behind <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, when it normally is
unable to send or receive signals from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. As of today, the two
planets were 147 million miles apart.
   Engineers will spend the coming days diagnosing the cause of the
communications breakdown and deciding how to prevent it from
happening again, <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> added.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was deployed <DATE>May 4, 1989</DATE>, from the shuttle Atlantis on
its <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY> mission to make the best maps and pictures yet of
Venus. The spaceship went into orbit around <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE> after
a looping 948-million-mile voyage.
   Less detailed radar pictures of Venus from other <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Soviet
spacecraft and from a radio telescope at <LOCATION>Arecibo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>,
revealed signs of faults on <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and also found tens of thousands
of volcanoes, although scientists still don't know if any are
active.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s first pictures showed in much better detail regions
that intensely faulted, and also ``clear indications a lot of
plains are (old) lava flows'' fractured by younger faults, <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON>
said.
   ``What we're seeing is some of the lava flows that came out of
large volcanoes, but we haven't seen any large volcanoes yet,'' he
added.
   <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said volcanic cinder cones in the pictures have craters
on top, and the cones range from three-fifths of a mile to 1 mile
wide. Their height hasn't yet been calculated.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> must pass over the same area twice to detect landscape
changes that would indicate volcanoes are erupting. It takes 243
Earth days for Venus to spin once beneath the nearly polar-orbiting
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, so it will be at least eight months until <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will
be able to look for signs of active volcanoes.
   When <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> first lost contact with <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>,
its sophisticated computer programs automatically put it into a
protective state of semi-hibernation called a ``safing mode,''
turning its solar panels to the sun to make sure it drew adequate
power, laboratory spokesman <PERSON>Jim Doyle</PERSON> said.
   Magellan automatically entered an even deeper hibernation <DATE>Friday</DATE>
<TIME>morning</TIME>, shutting down crucial systems to protect them but also
making the spacecraft start rotating as it beamed radio signals
into space.
   That assured some of the signals would reach Earth, but also
meant radio contact was intermittent throughout the day. The
command sent <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> stopped the rotation and kept <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s
secondary antenna pointed toward Earth to maintain contact.
   Communication through the secondary antenna is slower than
through <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s main antenna. But the secondary antenna
broadcasts a much broader, cone-shaped radio beam, allowing contact
to be maintained more easily. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said controllers will switch
back to the main antenna sometime next week.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s radio signals are tracked by 230-foot-wide, dish
antennas at <LOCATION>Goldstone</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> engineers tried to recover
today from an emotional roller-coaster ride after the unruly
spaceship gave them great pictures of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and ``moments of terror
and of great happiness.''
   ``We've got to get the team rested,'' <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project manager
<PERSON>Tony Spear</PERSON> told a news conference <DATE>Friday</DATE> at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was launched from the shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>May 4, 1989</DATE>.
It started orbiting Venus <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE> on a <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY> radar-mapping
mission to make the best pictures and maps yet of the cloud-covered
planet.
   The spacecraft returned its first pictures of Venus last week.
New pictures released <DATE>Friday</DATE>, including a spectacular
three-dimensional image, show a 20-mile-wide meteorite impact
crater with a floor covered by lava flows.
   Science and mission planning manager <PERSON>Tommy Thompson</PERSON> said
engineers and scientists felt ``a little strung out'' after the
spacecraft malfunctioned and lost contact with <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> twice: first
for 14 hours starting <DATE>Aug. 16</DATE>, then for 17{ hair-raising hours
beginning <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   ``It's kind of like having a date for the prom, stubbing your
toe the night before, getting up the next morning and stubbing a
toe on the other foot,'' <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> said.
   While <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> mission control is staffed around the clock, many
other team members were resting this <DATE>weekend</DATE>, he said.
   Until engineers identify and fix the problem that cut the radio
link, ``I think it's likely to happen again,'' <PERSON>Spear</PERSON> said <DATE>earlier
Friday</DATE>.
   If contact is lost again, engineers are ready with new computer
commands to ``kick start'' <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s automatic safety systems and
make the spacecraft re-establish contact with Earth immediately,
<ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION> said.
   ``My heart can't stand this 17-hour loss of signal'' again, he
said. ``There are moments of terror and of great happiness after we
recovered the signal.''
   The emotional wear-and-tear showed a bit <DATE>Friday</DATE> as <ORGANIZATION>National
Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> officials contradicted each
other on one possible explanation for the communication problems.
   During the news conference, spacecraft system engineer <PERSON>John
Slonski</PERSON> said the braking rocket <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> used to slow down and go
into orbit around <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> might have failed to separate fully, or
might have burned some cables as it was jettisoned.
   ``It's a possibility we're investigating that the solid rocket
motor really hasn't gone away _ that it's still hanging on'' and
bumping into <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Slonski</PERSON> said.
   Spear called that possibility remote and contrary to available
evidence, but also said it was conceivable the rocket yanked out
some cables on <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> as it separated from the spacecraft.
   Two hours later, the laboratory's public relations office issued
a statement saying there was ``currently no doubt the separation
was complete.'' Spokesmen refused to elaborate when asked to
explain the contradiction between that statement and those made by
Slonski.
   Even if the rocket had not completely separated, it wouldn't
prevent <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> from conducting its mission, <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION> said. The
official mapping effort is likely to start no earlier than
mid-September, two weeks later than planned, he said.
   Engineers also were considering the possibility the
communications failures were caused by problems with <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s
computer hardware or programs, or the unlikely chance <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is
being affected by previously unknown electrical fields around <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   One of the biggest joys was that <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s first pictures of
<LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, made during an <DATE>Aug. 16</DATE> radar test, lived up to <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s
promise of being 10 times more detailed than the best obtained from
radar on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> or from the Soviet Venera 15 and 16 spacecraft in
the mid-1980s.
   The meteorite impact crater shown in pictures released <DATE>Friday</DATE>
has a very smooth floor and a central peak. The smooth floor
indicates the crater was flooded by volcanic lava, either during or
sometime after the impact, said <PERSON>Steve Saunders</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s chief
scientist.
   He said the crater is relatively young geologically, 100 million
to 150 million years old. It is named after Soviet sculptor <PERSON>Anna
Golubkina</PERSON>, who lived from <DATE>1864</DATE> to <DATE>1927</DATE>.
   Other pictures from <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> showed intense ``Venusquake''
faulting, lava flows and a network of intersecting ridges and
valleys.

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers successfully capped a
daylong battle to stay in touch with <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> after the
balky spacecraft's first pictures of Venus showed old lava flows,
cinder cones and faults created by ``Venusquakes.''
   After repeatedly losing and regaining contact with <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>,
engineers sent a computer command to the spaceship <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>
that restored regular communications at <TIME>7:11 p.m. PDT</TIME>, said <PERSON>Tommy
Thompson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> science manager at the agency's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   ``We jumped up and clapped,'' he said. `It was just like the
home team scoring a touchdown.''
   <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> said engineers expected to remain in touch with
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> except when it flys behind <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, when it normally is
unable to send or receive radio signals from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   An unknown problem made <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> lose its radio link with <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> as it orbited Venus 147 million miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
Almost <TIME>15 hours later</TIME>, as engineers held a news conference,
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON>Steve Wall</PERSON> rushed into the room to announce
contact had been re-established.
   But as the hours passed, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> tracking stations in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> lost and regained <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s radio signal
because of built-in safety programs in the spacecraft's computers.
   When <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> first dropped out of contact, sophisticated
computer programs put it in a protective ``safing mode'' so that
its solar panels pointed to the sun to draw power. Hours later, the
safety system made the spacecraft rotate until its antenna located
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and resumed communications, <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Jim Doyle</PERSON> said.
   The spacecraft was programmed to keep rotating, which explained
why controllers kept losing and regaining contact, <PERSON>Doyle</PERSON> said.
   The command sent to <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> stopped the
spacecraft from rotating and kept its secondary antenna in
continuous communication with <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> except when the spacecraft is
behind <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will be kept in its protective mode until
the cause of the initial loss of contact is understood and fixed.
   Magellan project manager <PERSON>Tony Spear</PERSON> was optimistic the problem
wouldn't seriously affect <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY> mission to use
radar to make the best pictures and maps yet of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>'
cloud-covered landscape.
   ``I have faith in the spacecraft,'' he said, admitting he was
surprised by the trouble.
   The communications problem developed shortly after <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
bounced radar waves off Venus for its first test pictures of
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s nearest planetary neighbor. The information used to make
the pictures was sent to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> before contact was lost.
   ``We've got some raw images that look pretty damn good,'' <PERSON>Spear</PERSON>
said, adding the pictures would be released early next week despite
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s initial plans to wait until <DATE>September</DATE>.
   Project scientist <PERSON>Steve Saunders</PERSON>, who examined the pictures,
said they show old, hardened ``lava flows and faults and fractures
and (volcanic) cinder cones with craters on top.''
   ``The kind of faulting we see would certainly mean there are
Venusquakes,'' <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said.
   Earlier Soviet and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> spacecraft also revealed volcanic
features on <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, although <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s images are supposed to be 10
times more detailed.
   Magellan won't be able to learn if any Venusian volcanoes are
active for at least eight months. That's because it must pass over
the same area of Venus twice before it can determine if the
landscape has been altered by an eruption.
   <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s radar test returned far more pictures
than expected, covering several areas of the planet about 1,000
miles long by 15 miles wide. During normal mapping, which had been
scheduled to start <DATE>Aug. 29</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will make pictures of
noodle-shaped swaths of Venusian landscape about 10,000 miles long
by 15 or 16 miles wide. Those will be assembled into bigger
pictures.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s headaches were the latest for the <ORGANIZATION>National
Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>, which recently grounded its
shuttle fleet temporarily because of hydrogen leaks and had its
<ORGANIZATION>Hubble Space Telescope</ORGANIZATION> seriously impaired by a focusing flaw in a
mirror.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was launched from the shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>May 4, 1989</DATE>,
and went into orbit around <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE> after a roundabout 948
million-mile journey.
   Wall said engineers were out of contact with <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> on
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> as it turned away from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> to get a fix on two
stars, a calibration the spaceship routinely performs to make sure
it can point properly.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s radio signals are tracked by 230-foot-wide, dish
antennas at <LOCATION>Goldstone</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>.
   ``The assumption is that after it made a star calibration, it
looked at the wrong star and then couldn't point back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
accurately,'' said <PERSON>Doyle</PERSON>. ``Then, the contact was lost.''
   Engineers believe <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> detected some onboard problem, then
went into its protective mode. Spear said the spaceship probably
tried to get a fix on a ``guide star'' so it could figure out which
way it was pointing, but may have picked the wrong star or been
confused by stray sunlight reflecting off Venus.
   ``Most of us have been up most of the night'' dealing with the
problem, <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   Venus is covered by thick clouds that prevent optical cameras
from viewing its landscape. Magellan radar is designed to send
radar waves through the clouds, then collect the reflected radar
echoes and send them to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in digital form. Computers at <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION>
then can assemble them into maps and pictures.
   The spacecraft's radar was designed to distinguish surface
features as small as two football fields.

<TEXT>
   Here are key facts about the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
spacecraft, which is scheduled to go into orbit around <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> in
<DATE>August</DATE>:
   PRIMARY MISSION: To use radar to penetrate the clouds of Venus
and make pictures and maps of <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of the
planet's surface with 10 times better detail than any previous
images. <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will reveal signs of forces that shaped the
planet, including volcanism, meteorite impacts and possibly wind,
water and large-scale movements of the planet's crust.
   EXTENDED MISSION: A single Venusian day _ the time it takes the
planet to rotate once on its axis _ lasts 243 Earth days.
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s primary mission is to map the planet as it rotates once
below the polar-orbiting spacecraft. But <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> scientists expect to
obtain approval for additional 243-day mapping cycles so they can
make pictures and maps of most of the surface. The primary mission
will miss the planet's southernmost latitudes.
   COST: <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY> through the end of <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s primary 243-day
mapping effort, including <MONEY>$413 million</MONEY> for the spacecraft and its
instruments. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> cut costs by building <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> using some spare
parts from <LOCATION>Voyager</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft.
   LAUNCH: Deployed from cargo bay of space shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>May
4, 1989</DATE>, then launched by an inertial upper stage booster.
   THE VOYAGE: A 806 million-mile trip to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> in 15 months,
requiring 1{ loops around the sun.
   PROPULSION: A solid-fueled Star 48B rocket is to put <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
into orbit around <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE>. Twenty-four liquid-fueled
thrusters help point the spacecraft and adjust its trajectory.
   ORBIT: <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will orbit near <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' poles once every 3 hours
and 11 minutes, at an altitude ranging from 171 miles to almost
5,000 miles.
   VITAL STATISTICS: <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is 21 feet long and 15 feet in
diameter, and weighs 7,410 pounds.
   INSTRUMENTS: Synthetic aperture radar is to send radar waves and
catch the reflected waves to make two-dimensional pictures of
<LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, measure elevations for topographic maps, and determine heat
emissions from <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' surface to provide clues about surface
roughness and rock composition. Engineers on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> will precisely
track <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s speed to measure changes in the strength of the
gravity field on various parts of Venus. That will yield clues
about the planet's interior.
   POWER SUPPLY: A pair of solar panels charge the spacecraft's two
nickel-cadmium batteries.
   COMMUNICATIONS: <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s 12-foot antenna dish radios
information back to 230-foot, dish-shaped antennas in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Goldstone</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. The radar information will be
relayed to <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>,
where it will be assembled into maps and pictures.
   CONSTRUCTION: <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory managed the
project. <ORGANIZATION>Martin Marietta Corp.</ORGANIZATION> built the spacecraft in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Hughes Aircraft Co.</ORGANIZATION> built the radar in <LOCATION>El Segundo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.

   An alignment of the planets will
interfere with the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft's ability to send pictures
of Venus back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> for the next six weeks beginning <DATE>Sunday</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> says.
   During late <DATE>October</DATE> and early <DATE>November</DATE>, the sun was between
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, forcing a two-week halt to <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY>
mission to use radar to map the surface of cloud-shrouded <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   ``This time, <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> itself gets in the way,'' although mapping
can continue, said <PERSON>Steve Wall</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> experiment representative
at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Because of the relative positions of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> as they
orbit the sun, ``a straight line drawn from the spacecraft to the
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> goes straight through Venus'' for part of each day during the
42-day period, <PERSON>Wall</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> has already shown Venus is marked by quake faults,
gargantuan flows of solidified lava and countless volcanoes, some
of which may be erupting now.

<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s mission to map the rugged surface of Venus is being delayed again so 
a team of 40 engineers can figure out why the spacecraft keeps losing contact 
with <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> official said <DATE>today</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"We're targeting for the <DATE>last week</DATE> in <DATE>September</DATE> to start mapping," said <PERSON>Tony 
Spear</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project manager at the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Spear had said <DATE>Friday</DATE> that engineers hoped to fix the problem in time to have 
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> working properly by mid-September. Before <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> started 
malfunctioning, the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> planned for 
it to make pictures and maps of Venus on a regular basis starting <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The spaceship remained in a protective "safing mode" <DATE>today</DATE>, <PERSON>Spear</PERSON> said during 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers still haven't figured out why <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s radio link to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> failed 
for 14 hours starting <DATE>Aug. 16</DATE> and again for 17 1/2 hours beginning <DATE>Aug. 21</DATE>, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
So <PERSON>Spear</PERSON> said he organized a "tiger team" of 40 engineers from the laboratory 
and from <ORGANIZATION>Martin Marietta Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which built <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>, to determine 
what is wrong with the spaceship and repair it. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s <MONEY>$744-million mission</MONEY> is to use radar to peer through <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' thick 
clouds and make the best pictures and maps yet of the planet's surface. It was 
launched from space shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>May 4, 1989</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Pictures made during an <DATE>Aug. 16</DATE> radar test showed extensive "Venusquake" 
faults, vast flows of solidified lava, cinder cones, a lava-filled meteorite 
impact crater and countless valleys and mountain ridges on the surface of 
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s nearest planetary neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
Spear said one major theory is that something went wrong when <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> entered 
orbit around <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE>. It functioned almost flawlessly during the 15 
months it traveled a looping path of 948 million miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Spear ruled out the possibility, raised <DATE>Friday</DATE>, that <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s braking rocket 
may have failed to separate from the spacecraft after it went into Venus orbit. 
</P>
<P>
Mapping is being delayed not only because time is needed to fix <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, but 
also because the spacecraft's troubles have left engineers "mentally and 
physically exhausted," <PERSON>Spear</PERSON> said. "We've decided to give the team three days 
off around Labor Day." 
</P>
<P>
Engineers want to make sure <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> doesn't break down again when mapping is 
in progress because "it's not good for people's hearts," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Spear, fully aware of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s problems stemming from temporary grounding of the 
shuttle fleet and a severe defect on the <ORGANIZATION>Hubble Space Telescope</ORGANIZATION>, appealed to 
the public to "have patience" with <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>

"We're going to make it work," he pledged. "Have confidence in us."

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> decided to suspend the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
spacecraft's Venus map-making mission today, three days earlier
than planned, because a planetary lineup is affecting its
navigation and communications with <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   It will be at least 12 days before <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> can resume its <MONEY>$744
million</MONEY> mission to use radar to make pictures and maps of
cloud-covered <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, said <PERSON>Jim Scott</PERSON>, mission director at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Jet

   The space agency had planned to halt mapping by <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> for
nine days starting <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   But laboratory spokesman <PERSON>Jim Doyle</PERSON> said increasing difficulty
with <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s navigation, communications with <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, solar panels
and ability to make quality pictures prompted the decision to
suspend operations today.
   <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> said the problems may stem from an astronomical event
called ``superior conjunction.''
   That occurs next <DATE>Thursday</DATE> when <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and Earth are at their
maximum distance from each other - about 161 million miles - and
the sun lies almost directly between the two planets.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was launched from the space shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>May 4,
1989</DATE>. It went into orbit around Venus 2{ months ago, and started
mapping <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> full-time <DATE>Sept. 15</DATE>.
   So far, its radar pictures have shown extensive quake faults, a
wide variety of volcanos and lava flows, Los Angeles-sized
meteorite impact craters and 600-mile-wide bulges that are like the
``hot spots'' on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s crust that created <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>.

electrical fields or particles are disrupting <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s
electronics.
   The third group will examine changes on <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> as it went into

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> restored a high-speed radio link
with <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> that will allow a crucial test of the spacecraft on
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> and released more pictures of jagged lava flows and giant
volcanic craters on Venus.
   Engineers <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> pointed <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s main antenna toward
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, putting the high-speed communications on line for the first
time in four weeks and using the link to send home the contents of
the spacecraft's tape recorder.
   They they began analyzing the information for clues to why they
lost radio contact with the spacecraft for 14 hours starting <DATE>Aug.
16</DATE> and for 17{ hours starting <DATE>Aug. 21</DATE>.
   Restoring the high-speed radio link was a key step toward
letting <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> begin its <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY> mission to make highly
detailed maps and pictures of Venus using radar to penetrate the
planet's thick clouds.
   Engineers at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory had been using a
secondary <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> antenna to maintain contact with <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
Engineers figured that because the secondary antenna sends out a
broader beam than the main antenna, they would be less likely to
lose contact with the spacecraft if there were another glitch.
   Because of the communication problems, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was to start its
mapping mission late this month, about a month behind schedule.
   But if all goes well during a radar test on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> might
simply pronounce the mapping under way then, said experiment
representative <PERSON>Steve Wall</PERSON>. The craft is 155 million miles from Earth
   The three pictures released <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> were taken during an <DATE>Aug.
16</DATE> radar test, just hours before contact with the craft was first
lost.
   One picture shows at least two irregularly shaped craters _
called calderas _ similar to those atop <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Mauna Loa</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Kilauea</LOCATION> volcanoes. The largest is 5 miles long and 2.2 miles wide.
   The calderas were apparently created when lava flowed from vents
and caused the volcanoes' summits to collapse, said <PERSON>Steve Saunders</PERSON>,
the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project's chief scientist.
   Another picture shows a basalt lava flow 11 miles wide and at
least 15{ miles long. It has lobed edges, is extremely rough and
probably flowed in a ``thick, pasty'' manner before it solidified,
<PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said.
   A third new picture shows a valley, about six-tenths of a mile
wide, that formed when a block of land dropped down between two
faults as the area was being stretched apart, <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said.
   Similar fault-bounded valleys are found in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>East
Africa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>.
   Magellan went into orbit around <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> last month after traveling
a looping, 948-million-mile path since its launch from the shuttle
Atlantis in <DATE>May 1989</DATE>.

   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, the first <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> planetary
spacecraft launched in 12 years, reaches <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, raising
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s hopes for a major success after its woes with the Hubble
space telescope and the shuttle fleet.
   ``We're just thrilled to be here and are rarin' to go. We're
just as excited as we can be,'' said <PERSON>John McCarthy</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
program manager for <ORGANIZATION>Hughes Aircraft Co</ORGANIZATION>. Hughes built the science
instruments on the 21-foot-long spacecraft.
   At noon PDT <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was only 242,009 miles from
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, speeding toward the cloud-shrouded planet at 10,398 mph. It
was 144 million miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, but had traveled 946.3 million
miles since it was launched from the shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>May 4,
1989</DATE>.
   The <MONEY>$413 million</MONEY> spacecraft, centerpiece of a <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY>
mission, was scheduled to zoom over <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' north pole and then drop
into orbit after it fires its braking rocket at <TIME>9:32 a.m. PDT</TIME>
<DATE>Friday</DATE>. The spacecraft will be behind Venus at the time, so
engineers won't know if all went well until about half an hour
later.
   After a few weeks of tests, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will start using its radar
by <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE> to penetrate the thick Venusian clouds and make pictures
and maps of the planet's surface 10 times more detailed than those
returned by the Soviet Venera 15 and 16 spacecraft, which were
launched in <DATE>1983</DATE>.
   During a news conference <DATE>Thursday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics
and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, engineers and
scientists expressed confidence that <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s rocket will fire
properly and place the vessel in orbit.
   ``<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is the beginning of a new era of planetary
exploration,'' kicking off a decade in which unmanned craft will
study <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, Mars, asteroids, comets and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON>Wesley T.
Huntress Jr.</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s director of solar system exploration. ``We're
looking forward to the drama.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is the first <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> planetary spacecraft launched since
<DATE>1978</DATE>, when <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> sent the Pioneer 12 orbiter and the Pioneer 13
probes to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   If <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s rocket fails to ignite, the spacecraft would fly
past Venus uselessly and wouldn't encounter the planet again for
100 years, said <PERSON>Tony Spear</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project manager at the
laboratory.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> has been plagued by trouble lately, including temporary
grounding of the shuttle fleet because of hydrogen fuel leaks and a
defective mirror that largely crippled the <MONEY>$1.5 billion</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Hubble
Space Telescope</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The major pressure we feel is the pressure to succeed,''
<PERSON>Huntress</PERSON> said. ``I'd prefer not to speculate on what failure might
mean.''
   If <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> works as planned, it will return more data than all
previous <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> missions combined, said <PERSON>Steve Saunders</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s chief
scientist for <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>.
   Venus is similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> is size, density and position in the
solar system. <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will study's the planet's geology and
geography to learn if its geological processes are similar to those
on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, which is shaped by volcanoes and large-scale movements of
gargantuan plates of the planet's crust.
   ``Venus really is our sister planet,'' <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said. ``We need
to know a lot more about that planet to understand more about our
own.''
   The raw radar echoes collected by <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will be returned to
<ORGANIZATION>NASA Deep Space Network</ORGANIZATION> antennas in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, then converted into pictures at the <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion
Laboratory</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> expects to release the first pictures next month, unless a
major discovery is made during radar tests this month.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is named for Portuguese explorer <PERSON>Ferdinand Magellan</PERSON>,
who circumnavigated the world in the early 1500s.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, a robot spacecraft armed with a
sophisticated radar, is ready to rendezvous with <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and begin an
eight-month exploration and mapping of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s nearest
neighbor, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The spacecraft is scheduled to complete its 804-million-mile
voyage to <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE> when it fires a rocket engine to settle
into an orbit that dips to within 170 miles of the planet's surface.
   Officials said the craft would approach Venus at 24,600 miles
per hour and the rocket firing will slow <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> to 18,400 miles
per hour, enough to put it into the planet's orbital grasp.
   After a checkout period lasting until about <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
will use a powerful radar system to penetrate the dense clouds
above <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and gather images for a detailed map of the baked
surface of the torrid planet.
   Tony Spear, the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project manager, said at a news
conference that the only major problem experienced by the <MONEY>$413
million</MONEY> spacecraft during its long journey has been an electrical
failure in one gyroscope.
   Spear said the spacecraft needs two gyros to control its
position and is equipped with four. Loss of the one gyro, he said,
still leaves a full set of two, plus one spare.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was carried into space by the space shuttle Atlantis
and released into <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbit <DATE>May 4, 1989</DATE>. An upper stage rocket
engine fired to send <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> streaking out of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbit toward
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>. During its 15-month voyage, the spacecraft looped the sun,
passed <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s orbit once and then sped toward its <DATE>August</DATE> meeting
with <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   Spear said the plans called for <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> to spend 243 days, the
length of one <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> day, creating a radar map of <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>90
percent</PERCENT> of the planet's surface. If the craft continues to perform,
<ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION> said the mission would be extended for additional mapping
cycles until <DATE>1995</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will circle <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> once every three hours, spending 37
minutes of each orbit bouncing radar signals off the planet's
surface. Each pass will image a swath 10,000 miles long and about
16 miles wide. The data is stored in on-board recorders.
   When the spacecraft swings toward the high part of its orbit, it
will spin, aim its antennae toward <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and spend 115 minutes
transmitting the radar data back to <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s deep space network.
   Later, computers at the <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> will process
the signals into images that resemble aerial photos. Scientists
expect <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> to detect surface details as small as 260 yards
across, about 10 times more resolution than any of the 20 or so
spacecraft that have previously explored <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   Venus holds fascination for scientists because it's nearly the
same size and mass as the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and the two planets are thought to
have shared a similar planetary formation history.
   But the two planets differ significantly in temperature and
pressure.
   Venus has a surface temperature of about 900 degrees _ about the
temperature of a self-cleaning oven _ and its atmosphere is almost
pure carbon dioxide. Venus has no liquid water and the atmospheric
pressure is more than 90 times that of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Though <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> is 23 million miles closer to the sun than <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,
it is covered by acid clouds so dense that its surface is in
perpetual twilight.
   Because of the clouds, only a radar such as that carried by
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, can gather the images needed to map the Venusian surface.

<TEXT>
   ``Hiccups'' keep plaguing a computer
aboard the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft, which nevertheless has completed
more than 30 consecutive orbits making radar pictures of
cloud-covered <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> says.
   The pesky malfunctions are in the backup computer that helps
point the orbiter.
   The same computer - one of four aboard <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> - played a major
role when engineers lost contact with the spacecraft <DATE>Aug. 16</DATE> and
again on <DATE>Aug. 21</DATE>, although the precise cause of those incidents
remains unknown.
   Despite the glitches, the spacecraft on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>
completed its 30th consecutive orbit mapping the cracked, volcanic
landscape of Venus. <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, which arrived at <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE>, is
making almost eight orbits daily. It began its mapping mission on
<DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   ``Since Venus is almost the same size as <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, the 30-orbit
image patch ... would drape an area on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> extending from <LOCATION>Los
Angeles</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Albuquerque</LOCATION> and from the <LOCATION>North Pole</LOCATION> to nearly the <LOCATION>South
Pole</LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said in a statement.
   Pictures released in past weeks have shown long ridges and
valleys, networks of faults, large flows of solidified lava and
volcanic craters.
   The most recent glitch happened <DATE>Monday</DATE>, when the backup to
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s main computer got a set of false alerts from the backup
pointing computer. The spacecraft wasn't operating on either backup
computer, so mapping continued.
   Other glitches happened just after <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> reached <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, then
again on <DATE>Sept. 4</DATE>.
   Engineers nicknamed the malfunctions ``hiccups,'' said <PERSON>Steve
Wall</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> experiment representative at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> traveled a looping, 948-million-mile path to Venus
after being launched from the shuttle Atlantis in <DATE>May 1989</DATE>.
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> are now almost 156 million miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.

   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is the latest of many
spacecraft to visit <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>National Space Society</ORGANIZATION> list
these earlier missions, most of their launch and arrival dates, and
tasks.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Mariners</ORGANIZATION> and Pioneers were <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> spacecraft; the Veneras and
Vegas were Soviet.
   Mariner 2, launched <DATE>Aug. 27, 1962</DATE>, flew within 21,594 miles of
Venus on <DATE>Dec. 14, 1962</DATE>, found the planet lacked a magnetic field
and had 900-degree Fahrenheit surface temperatures.
   Venera 4, <DATE>June 12, 1967</DATE>, entered Venusian atmosphere <DATE>Oct. 18,
1967</DATE>, returning information for 93 minutes.
   Mariner 5, <DATE>June 14, 1967</DATE>, flew within 2,500 miles of Venus on
<DATE>Oct. 19, 1967</DATE>, measuring surface temperatures and atmospheric
makeup.
   Venera 5, <DATE>Jan. 5, 1969</DATE>, parachuted into Venusian atmosphere on
<DATE>May 16, 1969</DATE>, confirming it is mostly carbon dioxide and lacks
water vapor.
   Venera 6, <DATE>Jan. 10, 1969</DATE>, parachuted into Venusian atmosphere <DATE>May
17, 1969</DATE>, similar to Venera 5.
   Venera 7, <DATE>Aug. 17, 1970</DATE>, used parachute to make first soft
landing on Venus on <DATE>Dec. 15, 1970</DATE>, then transmitted data for 23
minutes.
   Venera 8, <DATE>March 27, 1972</DATE>, orbiter-lander, landed on sunlit side
of Venus on <DATE>July 22, 1972</DATE>, measuring surface temperature and
pressure.
   Mariner 10, <DATE>Nov. 3, 1973</DATE>, flew past Venus on <DATE>Feb. 5, 1974</DATE>, en
route to <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION>. Made visible and ultraviolet light images to
track circulation patterns in Venusian atmosphere.
   Venera 9, <DATE>June 8, 1975</DATE>, orbiter-lander, with lander providing
first glimpse of Venusian surface in a panoramic picture of
landscape near the touchdown site.
   Venera 10, <DATE>June 14, 1975</DATE>, orbiter-lander, sent panoramic view of
landing area and returned information about surface conditions for
65 minutes.
   Pioneer 12, also known as Pioneer <PERSON>Venus Orbiter</PERSON>, <DATE>May 20, 1978</DATE>,
started orbiting <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> on <DATE>Dec. 4, 1978</DATE>, first spacecraft to carry
radar to <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, mapped <PERCENT>92 percent</PERCENT> of the surface. Discovered <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>
has large rift valleys and 7-mile-high <PERSON>Mount Maxwell</PERSON>, a mile taller
than <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Mount Everest</LOCATION>.
   Pioneer 13, <DATE>Aug. 8, 1978</DATE>, sent four probes into Venusian clouds
on <DATE>Dec. 9, 1978</DATE>, obtaining information on wind patterns,
temperatures and pressures.
   Venera 11, <DATE>Sept. 9, 1978</DATE>, flyby and lander, touched down on <DATE>Dec.
5, 1978</DATE>, detected electric discharges and noises in Venus'
atmosphere.
   Venera 12, <DATE>Sept. 14, 1978</DATE>, flyby and lander. Imaging system
failed to return photos after <DATE>Dec. 21, 1978</DATE> landing.
   Venera 13, <DATE>Oct. 31, 1981</DATE>, orbiter-lander, relayed first color
images of Venus' surface after landing on <DATE>March 3, 1982</DATE>.
   Venera 14, <DATE>Nov. 4, 1981</DATE>, orbiter-lander, drilled soil samples,
returned color pictures and conducted a seismic experiment.
   Venera 15, <DATE>June 2, 1983</DATE>, and Venera 16, <DATE>June 7, 1983</DATE>, orbiters
only, used radar to map the northern <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> of Venus with
ability to picture features larger than about 1 mile. Pictures
revealed numerous volcanoes, meteorite impact craters and complex
deformation of Venus' crust.
   Vega 1, <DATE>Dec. 15, 1984</DATE>, and Vega 2, <DATE>Dec. 21, 1984</DATE>, missions to
<ORGANIZATION>Comet Halley</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>. Probes decscended into Venusian atmosphere.
