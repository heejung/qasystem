<TEXT>     2. Anna homma-duh homma-du-du-du hommaaaaaaaaa.;    3.
Dee-uh-dee-hah-hah-hah buh-huheee-buh-huhe-eee-eee-eee-ray-have.;    You say
you don't recognize it? Nonsense. Of course you do. It's likely that you've
heard and sung it dozens or hundreds of times, depending on your age. Your
parents sang it. And probably your grandparents too.;    You still don't know
it? I'll throw out a few hints.;    It's a very old song. The words were
written more than 150 years ago. The melody is even older than that. You still
don't know? Then you don't go to many Opening Days at baseball games.;    Of
course, when <PERSON>Francis Scott Key</PERSON> wrote that line, as well as the others that
precede and follow it, he kept the lyrics much simpler: "O'er the land of the
free and the home of the brave." And for many years, that's the way it was
sung.;    But it's no longer done that way. There has developed an informal
competition among singers at ballparks, hockey rinks, basketball stadiums and
other patriotic gathering places to see who can best turn "The Star-Spangled
Banner" into something resembling the howls of a maniac.;    I'm not sure when
these free-form interpretations began, although I vaguely remember some guy
named Jose creating a stir a few years ago by opening a World Series with a
rendition that sounded like the Star-Spangled Cha-Cha-Cha.;    Since then, I
have heard the anthem has been performed as the Star-Spangled Rock, the
Star-Spangled Disco, the Star-Spangled Gospel, the Star-Spangled Blues, the
Star-Spangled Hootenanny and the Star-Spangled Barbershop Quartet.;    A few
weeks ago, a woman who sang it before a <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Bulls</ORGANIZATION> game is believed to have
set a record by using a variety of prolonged howls, shrieks, warbles, screams
and other vocal acrobatics to drag it out to more than five minutes.;    A man
who was there told me: "I couldn't understand one word. And, I swear, if I
were a <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> policeman and I heard those sounds coming from a building, I
would radio for backup, then draw my gun and go crashing into the place on the
assumption that a woman was being brutally attacked by a gang of fiends.";   
I think it is time to draw the line. After all, it is our national anthem. As
such, it should be performed with some dignity, rather than sounding as if the
singer has been bitten in the rear by a pit bull.;    It's doubtful that
anyone would stand in center court at <LOCATION>Wimbledon</LOCATION> and sing: "Ga-hah
Say-hey-he-hey-iv ow-ow-owah guh-ray-hey-hey-hey-hey shush
Qwa-hey-qua-hey-heee-eeeen." (That's "God save our gracious queen," ballpark
style).;    And think of the children. Generation after generation of parents
bring their children to ballparks to introduce them to the national pastime.
Do we want these children later standing up in the assembly hall and saying:
"No, teacher, it starts like this: 'Oh-hoh-hey cah-han-you-see-uh-see-uh
by-the daw-haw-hawns err-uh-err-ee-uh-lee-lah-lite?"';    That isn't what
<PERSON>Francis Scott Key</PERSON> had in <LOCATION>mind.</LOCATION>;    On the other hand, some musicologists say
that the melody can be traced back to <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> where it had different lyrics
and was a drinking song. So maybe it's not totally inappropriate for today's
singers to sound as if they just downed a quart of <ORGANIZATION>Southern Comfort</ORGANIZATION>.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Francis Scott Key's Hometown Riled About Anthem Flap</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Legislation that would scrap ``The
Star-Spangled Banner'' as the national anthem has riled people in
the hometown of <PERSON>Francis Scott Key</PERSON>, who wrote the song 175 years ago.
   ``I honestly feel they should leave it be,'' said <PERSON>Harry L.
Decker</PERSON>, <PERSON>Frederick</PERSON>'s historian. ``I think it's more like a hymn than
a song. It brings tears to a lot of people's eyes.''
   Rep. <PERSON>Andrew Jacobs Jr.</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Ind.</LOCATION>, has introduced legislation in
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> for the ninth time in 12 years to supplant it with
``America the Beautiful.''
   <PERSON>Decker</PERSON> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> he thought the campaign for change was being
fueled by people who believe the song embraces war and by those who
think it's too hard to sing.
   ``If they can't sing it, they can't sing,'' <PERSON>Decker</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>David Maloney Jr.</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Historical Society of
Frederick County</ORGANIZATION>, said he liked ``America the Beautiful,'' but
thinks it's less ``emotionally stirring'' than ``The Star-Spangled
Banner.''
   The proposal to replace the national anthem also has struck a
sensitive chord with the <PERSON>Frederick Keys</PERSON>, the city's new minor
league baseball team.
   ``His monument (in Mount Olivet Cemetery) faces our new
stadium,'' said <PERSON>Mark Zeigler</PERSON>, the team's assistant general manager.
``I've got a lot of pride in this area and the state.
   ``This is something of local significance that is national. It
would take away some of the significance.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Frederick County Arts Council</ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON>Carole Werking</PERSON> said: ``I
like `America the Beautiful.' I think it is easier to sing, but
<PERSON>Francis Scott Key</PERSON> being <PERSON>Frederick</PERSON>'s native son and having a lot of
pride in my community, I don't think we should change it.''
   Gov. <PERSON>William Donald Schaefer</PERSON> has written to <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>'s
congressional delegation, urging them to oppose any change.
   <PERSON>Jacobs</PERSON> said the protests probably are unnecessary because he
doesn't think his bill will pass.

<LEADPARA>  Scott Erickson will not be the American League's starting pitcher in tonight's
62nd All-Star Game, but there will be a reminder of him on Toronto's SkyDome
mound.;    "I'm wearing the low socks in honor of Scotty," said Jack Morris,
Erickson's elder teammate at Minnesota and his replacement as the starting
pitcher. "I know how much he wanted to be here. He is by far the best pitcher
in the league at this point."  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  MORRIS GETS TO START TONIGHT IN PLACE OF TWINS TEAMMATE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  All-Star Game Preview;  SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT (publ. 7/10/91, pg. 2E); 
Because of an editor's error, the junior college for which Minnesota Twins
pitcher Scott Erickson formerly played was incorrect in Tuesday's editions.
Erickson played for San Jose City College.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     <PERSON>Erickson</PERSON>, from <ORGANIZATION>Homestead High</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>De Anza College</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Cupertino</LOCATION>, was 12-2
with a 1.83 ERA in this, his first full season. He would have started today,
but he was placed on the disabled list recently because of an elbow problem.; 
  <ORGANIZATION>While National League</ORGANIZATION> Manager <PERSON>Lou Piniella</PERSON> chose <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Tom Glavine</PERSON> to
start, counterpart <ORGANIZATION>Tony La Russa</ORGANIZATION> said he chose <PERSON>Morris</PERSON> because he is
right-handed.;    The only two A.L. left-handers are <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>'s Jimmy Key
(10-4) and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Mark Langston</PERSON> (12-3). There was speculation that Key
might start in front of his home fans, but La Russa said he wants the
left-handers available in later innings. <PERSON>Morris</PERSON> was chosen over <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Roger
Clemens</PERSON> (11-5), who slowed after a sizzling start this season.;    Starting
was an unexpected honor for <PERSON>Morris</PERSON>, but then, this hasn't been the sort of
season that was expected from him. He had been the winningest pitcher of the
<DATE>'80s</DATE>, and seemingly was a <ORGANIZATION>Detroit Tigers</ORGANIZATION> lifer. Many people considered the
small-market Twins foolish for giving him <MONEY>$3 million</MONEY> this season as a free
agent. But <PERSON>Morris</PERSON>, 36, won seven in a row at one stretch and is 11-6 with a
3.65 ERA.; Franco pained; by fan voting;  As it turns out, <PERSON>Julio Franco</PERSON> has
had more to worry about than <PERSON>Roberto Alomar</PERSON>'s ability.;    <LOCATION>Franco</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Texas
Rangers</ORGANIZATION>' second baseman and <DATE>last year</DATE>'s All-Star MVP, said <DATE>Sunday</DATE> that
<LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Alomar</PERSON>, voted the <ORGANIZATION>A.L.</ORGANIZATION> starter in fan balloting, does not deserve to
start ahead of him at second base. Franco left <LOCATION>Arlington Stadium</LOCATION> after saying
that -- and was checked into a nearby hospital because of chest discomfort.;  
 The diagnosis was that the problem was caused by a combination of the heat
and caffeine; he was discharged <DATE>Monday</DATE> morning.;    <PERSON>Alomar</PERSON> is hitting .284
with 37 RBIs, 27 steals and eight errors.;    "He can keep talking all he
wants," <PERSON>Alomar</PERSON> said of Franco, who is hitting .318 with 40 RBIs, 17 steals and
11 errors. "He's going to have to wait five or six innings before he gets into
the All-Star Game.";    Who says All-Star games aren't exciting anymore?; Like
old times; for <LOCATION>Sanderson</LOCATION>;  <PERSON>Dave Henderson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Rickey Henderson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dennis Eckersley</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Scott Sanderson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dave Duncan</PERSON>, <PERSON>Rene Lachemann</PERSON> and <PERSON>Tommie Reynolds</PERSON>. Which one of
those names does not belong?;    If you said <PERSON>Sanderson</PERSON>, you're technically
correct. He no longer represents the A's, but those seven lockers are side-by-
side in the <LOCATION>A.L.</LOCATION> clubhouse. For <PERSON>Sanderson</PERSON>, who is 9-3 since the A's let him to
go the <LOCATION>New York Yankees</LOCATION> as a free agent, this is like old times.;    "Any time
I think about my days with the A's, I just have a real good feeling," said
<PERSON>Sanderson</PERSON>, who won 17 games last season but was not re-signed, purely for
economic reasons. "I think I'm a much better player for having played in
<LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>. A lot of players can go their whole careers and not get a chance to
be on a team like that."; <PERSON>Ripken</PERSON> wins home run battle;   <LOCATION>Cal Ripken</LOCATION>'s 18
homers were the most by a major league shortstop before the All-Star break
since <PERSON>Rico Petrocelli</PERSON> had 23 in <DATE>1969</DATE>. The <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> iron man has been doing it
all this season, so maybe we shouldn't be surprised that he made such sluggers
as <PERSON>Cecil Fielder</PERSON>, <PERSON>Howard Johnson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Joe Carter</PERSON> look like lightweights
Monday.;    <PERSON>Ripken</PERSON> won the <ORGANIZATION>Home Run Derby</ORGANIZATION> with 12 homers in 20 swings, seven
more than the nearest competitor, <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Paul O'Neill</PERSON>. Fielder hit
four.;    <PERSON>Ripken</PERSON> amazed the lunchtime crowd by hitting seven of the first
eight pitches for homers.;    "Lachemann just kept saying, 'Geez,' " <PERSON>Ripken</PERSON>
said of the A's coach, who served as the derby's catcher. "It's funny, I got
to take a few extra swings in (batting practice), and I was going to right
field. I didn't feel I'd be able to take it up a notch. It didn't feel good.";
<PERSON>Carter</PERSON> learns how sweet it is;  After all those 100-RBI seasons, <PERSON>Joe Carter</PERSON>
finally made it to an All-Star Game. The fact that he is playing before his
newest home fans obviously makes it even sweeter.;    "It was a long time
coming, but that's been the way with my entire career," said <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>, who was
traded with <PERSON>Roberto Alomar</PERSON> from <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> over the <DATE>winter</DATE> for <PERSON>Fred McGriff</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Tony Fernandez</PERSON>. "People doubted my ability, and that drove me. Hopefully,
people will keep doubting me and I'll keep proving them wrong."; Please
explain that again, <PERSON>Lou;   Piniella</PERSON> tried to explain why he chose <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION>'s
<PERSON>Ivan Calderon</PERSON> over <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>George Bell</PERSON> to sub for <PERSON>Darryl Strawberry.</PERSON>;    "We
have two natural left fielders on the team," <PERSON>Piniella</PERSON> said. "Calderon is
having a good season, plus he knows the <ORGANIZATION>A.L.</ORGANIZATION> well. He's faced <PERSON>Morris</PERSON> quite a
few times.";    Didn't <ORGANIZATION>Bell</ORGANIZATION> also just come from a long <LOCATION>A.L.</LOCATION> career?; <PERSON>Butler</PERSON> is
bearing no grudges;  <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Dodgers</ORGANIZATION> center fielder <PERSON>Brett Butler</PERSON>, making
his first All-Star appearance, said he holds no grudges against <ORGANIZATION>Giants General
Manager Al Rosen</ORGANIZATION>. Last <DATE>winter</DATE>, <PERSON>Rosen</PERSON> chose to let <PERSON>Butler</PERSON> become a free agent
and signed <PERSON>Willie McGee</PERSON> as his replacement.;    "He's like a father to me,"
<PERSON>Butler</PERSON> said. "Say a father does something his son doesn't understand -- you
still love him. It doesn't mean I don't respect him. . . . I was very close to
Al, and I still am.";    <PERSON>Butler</PERSON> said he wants to talk about the past <DATE>winter</DATE>
with <PERSON>Rosen</PERSON> over dinner but said his schedule has been too busy. "I just want
to hear it," he said. "I just want to know what went through his mind.";    As
for <PERSON>Rosen</PERSON>'s future, <PERSON>Butler</PERSON> predicted, "Al's not going to step away until he's
back. Al <PERSON>Rosen</PERSON> will not step down until that team is back where it should be.
To go from one extreme to the other, they want it back. Roger (<PERSON>Craig</PERSON>) is the
same way. It's more for (<ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> owner) <PERSON>Bob Lurie</PERSON>, because of the man he is."  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bing and <PERSON>Lou Russell</PERSON> shifted uncomfortably in their seats, growing ever more 
irate as the heckler, a few rows back, continued his relentless diatribe. The 
target was the first baseman for the visiting <LOCATION>Peoria</LOCATION> (<LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>) <LOCATION>Chiefs</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, number nine, hustle to your position," the man yelled in a thick Latino 
accent. "You're better than that, nine. Stay in the game." 
</P>
<P>
No. 9 happened to be <PERSON>Matt Franco</PERSON>, the Russells' grandson. Finally, they had 
heard enough. Lou turned to confront the loudmouth, then gasped in 
astonishment. It was her son, <PERSON>Kurt Russell</PERSON>, doing one of his better acting 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Russell, best known for his roles in such films as "Silkwood," "Escape From New 
York" and "The Best of Times," had only the best of intentions, however. He 
wanted to fire up Franco without revealing his identity. No one knew <PERSON>Kurt</PERSON> was 
at the game in <LOCATION>Rockford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, not even his parents. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard him for a while, and when the inning ended, I looked up and it was 
<PERSON>Kurt</PERSON>," <PERSON>Franco</PERSON> said. "He was dressed to conceal his identity. He's gotta go 
incognito." 
</P>
<P>
Franco, whose mother <PERSON>Jill</PERSON> is <PERSON>Kurt</PERSON>'s sister, rapidly is establishing his own 
identity. A 6-foot-3 left-handed hitter from <LOCATION>Westlake High</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Franco</PERSON> is 
challenging for the <ORGANIZATION>Midwest League</ORGANIZATION> batting title. With 13 games to play, he is 
batting .290, 15 points behind league-leader <PERSON>Scott Cepicky</PERSON> of <LOCATION>South Bend</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ind</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Franco has batted .382 the past month for the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Cubs</ORGANIZATION>' Class-A affiliate 
after beginning the season in a horrendous slump. 
</P>
<P>
Like any 20-year-old from <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Franco</PERSON> saw his spirits -- and 
batting average -- rise along with the temperature. 
</P>
<P>
"The first few weeks were ridiculous. Some nights it was 18 degrees with the 
wind-chill factor," <PERSON>Franco</PERSON> said. "Who can hit when your hands are numb?" 
</P>
<P>
Bedeviled: They have used pitches rather than pitchforks, but two former 
<ORGANIZATION>Arizona State Sun Devils</ORGANIZATION> have helped toss former <ORGANIZATION>Camarillo High</ORGANIZATION> right-hander 
<PERSON>Travis Willis</PERSON> from <LOCATION>Peoria</LOCATION>'s starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs assigned <PERSON>Lance Dickson</PERSON>, their <DATE>1990</DATE> No. 1 draft choice out of <ORGANIZATION>Arizona 
State</ORGANIZATION>, to <LOCATION>Peoria</LOCATION> on <DATE>July 4</DATE>. After four starts, <PERSON>Dickson</PERSON> was promoted. He is now 
with the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing <PERSON>Dickson</PERSON> at <LOCATION>Peoria</LOCATION> was <PERSON>Troy Bradford</PERSON>, the team's third-round draft 
pick, also out of <ORGANIZATION>Arizona State</ORGANIZATION>. About the same time, Manager <PERSON>Greg Mahlberg</PERSON> 
decided to stick with a four-man rotation after using five starters much of the 
season. All of which left <PERSON>Willis</PERSON> in long relief. 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, <PERSON>Willis</PERSON> seemed an odd choice for banishment to the bullpen. The 
former <LOCATION>Cal</LOCATION> standout was 8-9 with an earned-run average of 3.18 in 20 starts for 
the Chiefs (49-77), who are last in the <LOCATION>Midwest League</LOCATION>. With five complete 
games he still ranks among league leaders and he has walked only 39 in 154 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
"My control worked against me," <PERSON>Willis</PERSON> said. "They told me I'm a guy they can 
count on to come in and throw strikes. I was a better candidate for the bullpen 
than somebody who can't find the plate." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Willis</PERSON> has been hit hard in relief -- he is now 9-11 with a 3.49 ERA -- and 
<PERSON>Mahlberg</PERSON> might be having a change of heart. <PERSON>Willis</PERSON> got a start against <LOCATION>Waterloo</LOCATION> 
(<LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>) on <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> and gave up one earned run, getting the win in the 
<ORGANIZATION>Chiefs</ORGANIZATION>' 5-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Holy Toledo: How <PERSON>Scott Muckey</PERSON> made his professional coaching debut at age 37 is 
basically a travel story. Certainly, it's circuitous. 
</P>
<P>
The manager of the <PERSON>Toledo</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>) Mud Hens, <PERSON>John Wockenfuss</PERSON>, was afraid to fly, 
so he was told to hit the road. The lone coach, <PERSON>Aurelio Rodriguez</PERSON>, had family 
problems in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, so he took off south of the border, never to return. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Tom Gamboa</PERSON>, the new Mud Hen manager, called <PERSON>Muckey</PERSON>, a longtime friend, <DATE>July 18</DATE> 
and asked if he had two months to spare. <PERSON>Muckey</PERSON> was on the next flight to 
<LOCATION>Toledo</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"It took me all of a few seconds to make the decision," said <PERSON>Muckey</PERSON>, who had 
planned to spend the <DATE>summer</DATE> in his usual manner -- coaching an <ORGANIZATION>American Legion</ORGANIZATION> 
team and helping out at baseball camps. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Muckey</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Crespi High</ORGANIZATION> coach, has been at the high school or junior college 
levels since his playing career ended at <ORGANIZATION>Pepperdine</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1974</DATE>. All of a sudden, 
he found himself pitching batting practice and coaching first base for the 
<ORGANIZATION>Detroit Tigers' triple-A International League</ORGANIZATION> affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
In <PERSON>Muckey</PERSON>'s first game, <LOCATION>Toledo</LOCATION> played <LOCATION>Oklahoma City</LOCATION>, which coincidentally is 
managed by <PERSON>Steve Smith</PERSON>, a friend of <ORGANIZATION>Muckey's</ORGANIZATION>. "He was kind of surprised to see 
me," <PERSON>Muckey</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The rookie coach trotted out to the first-base coach's box. The first Toledo 
batter singled . . . and was promptly picked off. The next <LOCATION>Toledo</LOCATION> batter 
doubled . . . and was picked off. Two innings later, a <LOCATION>Toledo</LOCATION> batter singled . 
. . and was picked off. 
</P>
<P>
"Old Smitty's over there in the dugout laughing at me," <PERSON>Muckey</PERSON> recalled. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Muckey</PERSON> has earned respect with his understated manner and knowledge of the 
game. Yet he is a mere chick among the <ORGANIZATION>Mud Hens</ORGANIZATION> in terms of professional 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I've made all the rookie mistakes. Just trying to keep track of the time 
schedule is hard enough," he said, chuckling. "I was running out there with my 
uniform on when we were supposed to be in batting practice tops." 
</P>
<P>
Another day he forgot his cap. "If they were serious about fining me, they 
could have slapped me for <MONEY>$150</MONEY> for not being in the right place at the right 
time." 
</P>
<P>
The fans have been less forgiving. During a game in <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Muckey</PERSON> 
fielded a foul ball down the first-base line and tossed it to the ball boy. 
</P>
<P>
Oops. 
</P>
<P>
"The crowd was all over me," he said. "I don't know why. But now when a ball 
comes near me, I watch it roll by." 
</P>
<P>
The season itself is flying by. Muckey is enjoying every minute, but after a 
month beating around the bush leagues, he paints a less-than-romantic picture: 
Sit around a hotel room until 3 or <TIME>4 p.m.</TIME>, head to the ballpark, try to wind 
down after <TIME>midnight</TIME>. The next day, ditto. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the pro life's for everyone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably a lot of kids looking to be pro players are in for a little bit of a 
surprise." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Muckey</PERSON>, not being much for night life, has used his time in the hotel room to 
prepare for his Crespi teaching duties -- school begins <DATE>Sept. 3</DATE>, one day after 
the <ORGANIZATION>Mud Hens</ORGANIZATION>' season ends. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm studying up on physiology," he said without enthusiasm. "That's what they 
have me teaching this year."

to date, there will be an Olympics, the winter one, in
Albertville, France, beginning in about 10 weeks. And the
U.S. will field a hockey team as usual, although there's been
little fuss about that, either.
   "There's been less hype this time around -- no doubt about
that," affirmed Dave Peterson, the hockey team's coach,
before his charges faced the St. Louis Blues of the National
Hockey League here Monday night in the 35th game of its
60-game pre-Olympic tour.

<DATE>February</DATE> winter games is "probably because expectations of
our doing well haven't been as high as they were prior to
previous Games." But he made it clear he wasn't complaining:
"If I had my way, it'd be quieter yet. The fewer distractions
we have, the easier it is to prepare a squad. And public
relations isn't exactly the thing I do best."
   Ah, yes, public relations. You'll recall (or, maybe, you
don't) that <PERSON>Peterson</PERSON> coached our last Olympic hockey team, at
<LOCATION>Calgary</LOCATION> in <DATE>1988</DATE>. And unlike the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>'s "Miracle on Ice" gang
that won a gold medal at <LOCATION>Lake Placid</LOCATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE>, its 3-3
won-lost record, and seventh-place finish in a field of 12,
defined mediocrity. But he enlivened things by answering
questions about the club's performance by questioning his
questioners' motives and intelligence.
   Before he got the job this time around, <ORGANIZATION>USA Hockey</ORGANIZATION>, which
runs this particular show, insisted <PERSON>Peterson</PERSON> take a course in
responding to the news media. The long-time <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> high
school coach obliged, and reports that the experience was
relatively painless.
   "We did some role playing. I even held the notebook for
awhile," he said, smiling. "I think I learned a few things,
but it didn't really change my perspective. As I saw it, the
problem at <LOCATION>Calgary</LOCATION> was that some reporters wanted me to
negatively evaluate individual players, and I wouldn't do it.
Given the same circumstances, I'd probably react the same way
again. But all in all, I enjoyed <LOCATION>Calgary</LOCATION>, and learned there,
too. And, maybe, the circumstances won't be the same this
time."
   The fact that Team <ORGANIZATION>USA</ORGANIZATION> was here, playing the <ORGANIZATION>NHL Blues</ORGANIZATION>,
reflects one thing that <PERSON>Peterson</PERSON> learned in <DATE>'88</DATE>. The '88 team
compiled a gaudy, 37-18-5 pre-Olympic record, but it was
achieved mainly at the expense of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> collegiate teams that
offered little competition or preparation for Olympic-level
hockey. The record of this year's crew after a 6-4 loss to
the Blues <DATE>Monday</DATE> is 14-16-5, but it probably means more
because it comes mostly from a tougher card of NHL or elite
foreign teams.
   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> defeated a Soviet national team in an <DATE>August</DATE>
tournament in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and holds a 2-2-2 record after two,
three-game sets against the <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Nationals</ORGANIZATION>. Its 3-10-2
mark against <ORGANIZATION>NHL</ORGANIZATION> competition includes wins over the <LOCATION>Minnesota
North Stars</LOCATION> and San Jose Sharks (two) and ties with the
<LOCATION>Philadelphia Flyers</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Buffalo Sabres</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Peterson</PERSON>'s '88 team was faulted for loose defense,
especially during an Olympics in which it surrendered 31
goals in six outings. The coach says that was partly an
offshoot of a free-wheeling style that produced a lot of
goals as well, and wonders aloud why a 3-1 defeat should be
preferable to one of 7-5. That, not incidentally, was the
score by which <ORGANIZATION>Team USA</ORGANIZATION> fell to the favored Czechs and
gold-medal-winning Soviets at <LOCATION>Calgary</LOCATION>. And while he admits
his current crew has been "overpowered" on occasion by bigger
NHL outfits, he says "we expect our speed to make us better
defensively this time around" once it gets on the larger ice
surface used in international play.
   Withal, the coach says this team shapes up as faster and
deeper than his last unit, and one that contains a better
blend of youth and experience. Among the younger players
showing early foot are <PERSON>Shawn McEachern</PERSON>, a 22-year-old wing
out of <ORGANIZATION>Boston University</ORGANIZATION> who is its leading scorer with 18
goals and 15 assists in 31 games; <PERSON>Scott Lachance</PERSON>, a speedy,
18-year-old defenseman from the same school; and <PERSON>Ted Drury</PERSON>, a
19-year-old center from <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION>. In the experience category,
nobody tops center <PERSON>Scott Fusco</PERSON>. He's a 28-year-old <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION>
grad who was a member of the <DATE>1984</DATE> and '88 Olympic teams. As
far as he knows, no one else ever played for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> in
three Olympics in the sport.
   Fusco, a smallish redhead, quit hockey after the last
Games and went to work in his family's computer business in
<LOCATION>Winchester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>. Last <DATE>July 4</DATE>, though, he got back on skates,
found he could still stand and liked the feeling, and so
again reported for duty. "A lot of people played sports in
college, and quite a few are pros, but being an Olympian puts
you in a special club," he says by way of explanation.
   Goalie is, probably, the key position in the six- or
eight-game Olympic hockey sprint, and the identity of the man
or men who will protect the nets for <ORGANIZATION>Team USA</ORGANIZATION> is still in
doubt. <PERSON>Scott Gordon</PERSON>, formerly of the <ORGANIZATION>NHL</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Quebec Nordiques</ORGANIZATION>,
and <PERSON>Les Kuntar</PERSON>, out of <ORGANIZATION>St. Lawrence U.</ORGANIZATION>, split the post until
<PERSON>Kuntar</PERSON> suffered a broken jaw. <PERSON>Ray LeBlanc</PERSON>, a veteran minor
leaguer, took <PERSON>Kuntar</PERSON>'s place and gave up but four goals in
three games before <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. The Blues got him for six,
but the number easily could have been nine or 10, and
<PERSON>Peterson</PERSON> later expressed himself as impressed.
   The world has changed since the '88 Games, and in ways
that may improve <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> chances for a hockey medal. Most
obviously, some of the best Soviet players have opted for
capitalism and will be playing for the <ORGANIZATION>NHL</ORGANIZATION>'s lucre while
others maintain the honor of what's left of the <ORGANIZATION>USSR</ORGANIZATION> at
<LOCATION>Albertville</LOCATION>. But people who know about such things say there
are sufficient proficient icemen left to make the Sovs the
choice for their eighth Olympic gold medal in the sport in
the last 10 quadrenniums, with the Swedes, Finns, Czechs and
Canadians not far behind.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> teams have done pretty well in recent international
tournaments, finishing fifth in the last World Championships
and second in the <DATE>1990</DATE> Goodwill Games. The brusque, beefy
<PERSON>Peterson</PERSON> opines that "despite what some people thought, we
weren't all that far out of it" in <DATE>'88</DATE>, and says he expects a
medal this time.
   "That's why we have a team," he says. "If it isn't,
nobody's told me."

   O'er the ramparts rained criticism of Roseanne
<PERSON>Barr</PERSON>'s screeching, off-key rendition of the national anthem at a
baseball game, but the comedian defended her conduct even if her
wailing solo struck out.
   ``Geez, gimme a break. I was just trying to sing a song,'' the
caustic star of the <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> sitcom ``Roseanne'' told Los Angeles-area
television station <ORGANIZATION>KCAL</ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview broadcast <DATE>Thursday</DATE>
<TIME>night</TIME>.
   Barr conceded she was ``no <PERSON>Beverly Sills</PERSON>,'' referring to the
famed opera singer. She said she has a naturally shrill singing
voice.
   ``I apologize that people were so appalled,'' she said.
   But she added: ``If this is the worst thing they ever heard,
they've had it really easy.'' <PERSON>Barr</PERSON> said if she ever sang the anthem
again she'd ``want to do it for a hipper crowd.''
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, flying to <LOCATION>Kennebunkport</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, for the <DATE>weekend</DATE>,
said <DATE>today</DATE> that <PERSON>Barr</PERSON>'s rendition was ``disgraceful. That's the way
I feel about it and I think a lot of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> fans said the same
thing.''
   Fans at <PERSON>Jack Murphy Stadium</PERSON>, where the <LOCATION>San Diego Padres</LOCATION> were
playing a doubleheader with the <ORGANIZATION>Cincinnati Reds</ORGANIZATION>, booed <PERSON>Barr</PERSON> after
the shrieking performance <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   After screaming the final notes, she grabbed her crotch and spit
on the field.
   Barr told <ORGANIZATION>KCAL</ORGANIZATION> the crotch-grabbing gesture and spitting were
meant to parody mannerisms common among some baseball players, not
to show disrepect for the anthem or booing fans.
   The comedy actress had been invited to sing ``The Star-Spangled
Banner'' by her boss, <PERSON>Tom Werner</PERSON>, the co-creator and executive
producer of ``Roseanne.'' Earlier this year, <PERSON>Werner</PERSON> led a 15-member
investment group that bought the Padres for <MONEY>$75 million</MONEY>. He is now
chairman and managing partner of the team.
   Padres headquarters were deluged by 1,200 calls <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, mostly
complaints. The team issued an apology and said in the statement
that they ``recognize their obligation to ensure the national
anthem is sung with respect and dignity.''
   National League President <PERSON>William D. White</PERSON> said: ``We have
discussed it with the Padres and are in agreement with their
apology. We are satisfied that they will take all necessary steps
to assure it will not happen again.''
   On <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, before their game against the <ORGANIZATION>Houston Astros</ORGANIZATION>,
the Padres played a taped version of the national anthem performed
by the <ORGANIZATION>Marine Corps</ORGANIZATION>. The crowd gave it a rousing ovation.
   Barr's caterwauling rendition was the subject of much of <PERSON>Johnny
Carson</PERSON>'s ``Tonight Show'' monologue <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   ``<PERSON>Francis Scott Key</PERSON> must be spinning like a lathe,'' he quipped,
referring to the anthem's composer. ``The closest sound I heard was
when I got my cat neutered.''
   Others leveled more serious criticism.
   ``It was to me like burning of the flag,'' said <PERSON>Robert Merrill</PERSON>,
70, who has been singing the national anthem in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s Yankee
Stadium for 18 years.
   Padres pitcher <PERSON>Eric Show</PERSON> said, ``It's an insult. There are
people who died for that song.''
   About 30,000 people attended the doubleheader promoted as
``Working Women's Night.''
   ``I was embarrassed for the women who showed up,'' said
spectator <PERSON>Jannette Davis</PERSON> of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>. ``This was supposed to be a
night of saluting those who worked hard and she made us all feel
like crap.''
   It wasn't the first time <PERSON>Barr</PERSON> achieved notoriety at a baseball
game. In the stands during a World Series game in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> <DATE>last
fall</DATE>, she bared her bottom, revealing a tattoo declaring ``Tom'' _
her husband, <PERSON>Tom Arnold</PERSON>.
   On <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, <PERSON>Arnold</PERSON> urged critics to lighten up.
   ``They knew what kind of singer she is. She's just an average
singer. She's not an opera singer,'' <PERSON>Arnold</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>The Associated
Press</ORGANIZATION> by telephone from their <LOCATION>Malibu</LOCATION> home. ``She did the best she
could.''
   Barr wouldn't come to the telephone, but was troubled by the
criticism, he said.
   ``She's very sorry,'' <PERSON>Arnold</PERSON> said. ``She's very upset that
people think she meant disrespect.''

<HEAD>Birthplace of National Anthem Rallies to Its Defense</HEAD>

   Oh say, can you sing the national anthem?
   Most people can't, says a congressman from <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> who wants to
scrap ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' as the nation's official song in
favor of the less straining ``<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> the Beautiful.''
   Rep. <PERSON>Andrew Jacobs</PERSON> also says the poem penned by <PERSON>Francis Scott</PERSON>
Key after American troops repelled British forces at <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>'s
<LOCATION>Fort McHenry</LOCATION> in <DATE>1814</DATE> is unsuitable because it celebrates war and
because the tune's origin is an old drinking song _ and an English
one, to boot.
   <PERSON>Jacobs</PERSON>' introduction of a bill to make the change, though
nothing new, has provoked a spirited defense.
   ``Who says you can't sing it?'' demanded <ORGANIZATION>Maryland Historical
Society</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Darlene Frank</PERSON>.
   The society held a contest in <DATE>September</DATE> to commemorate the 175th
anniversary of the writing of the anthem and found ``more than 300
patriotic Americans who loved the song enough to want to sing it in
public ... and a capella, no less,'' <PERSON>Frank</PERSON> wrote in a letter
dismissing <PERSON>Jacob</PERSON>'s proposal.
   The Democrat has introduced the bill nine times in 12 years,
without gaining any appreciable support.
   ``It's not a burning issue in my existence,'' <PERSON>Jacobs</PERSON> said.
   Still, he does not plan to forego the campaign. ``America the
Beautiful'' is gradually eclipsing ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' as
the song of choice at official functions, he said.
   In <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>, Gov. <PERSON>William Donald Schaefer</PERSON> has asked the state's
congressional delegation to oppose <PERSON>Jacobs</PERSON>' bill. The <PERSON>Frederick</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Keys</LOCATION>, a minor league baseball team named for the composer,
also opposes the change.
   <PERSON>Karen Stuart</PERSON>, head librarian at the <ORGANIZATION>Maryland Historical Society</ORGANIZATION>,
said the latest attempt to replace the anthem has prompted more
outcry that in the past.
   The public may be more sensitive because of the emphasis on the
<ORGANIZATION>Pledge of Allegiance</ORGANIZATION> during the <DATE>1988</DATE> presidential campaign and the
<ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>'s ruling last <DATE>summer</DATE> that the burning of the flag is
a protected form of free speech.
   Key wrote the anthem to commemorate the defense of <LOCATION>Fort McHenry</LOCATION>,
where citizen soldiers withstood 25 hours of bombardment from
British ships during the War of <DATE>1812</DATE>.
   Key almost certainly took some poetic liberties in his most
famous verse. Historians say it is unlikely he saw the flag
``gallantly streaming'' because it would have been soggy after a
night of pounding rain. And <PERSON>Stuart</PERSON> said some scholars question
whether the rockets' red glare was sufficient to illuminate the
banner through the smoke and mist from as far away as the truce
ship which Key was aboard.
   Flawed or not, ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' enjoyed immediate
popularity in the young nation. The melody was ``To Anacreon in
Heaven,'' the slightly bawdy theme song of a private men's club in
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. The tune became well-known on both sides of the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>
but didn't get official recognition until <DATE>1931</DATE>.
   Its rival _ the tribute to spacious skies and amber waves of
grain _ was written in the <DATE>late 19th century</DATE> by a <LOCATION>Wellesley</LOCATION> College
English literature professor, <PERSON>Katherine Lee Bates</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Jacobs</PERSON> said he was impressed by the story of how <PERSON>Bates</PERSON> was
inspired to write ``America the Beautiful,'' not by an armed
conflict, but by the beauty she beheld from the peak of a <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>
mountain.
   But neither song is <PERSON>Jacobs</PERSON>' personal favorite among patriotic
tunes.
   ``I like `This Land Is Your Land,''' he said.

<LEADPARA>  THIS SUNDAY, March 3, marks the 60th anniversary of our national anthem, "The
Star-Spangled Banner." I'll bet you thought that the song was more than 60
years old -- and it is. But it was officially adopted as our national anthem
by the U.S. Congress and President Herbert Hoover on March 3, 1931.;    The
words were composed during the War of 1812 by a lawyer from Washington, D.C.
named Francis Scott Key, whose involvement in the whole matter was quite
accidental. Key had been persuaded by several friends of a physician named
William Beanes, who had become a prisoner of war, to negotiate with the
British navy for the release of the doctor. For some reason, Dr. Beanes had
been picked up by soldiers off the streets of Washington during a British
assault on the city that had resulted in the burning of the White House, the
Capitol, and other public buildings. He was taken back to the British naval
ships that had blockaded Chesapeake Bay, and it is there that Key went to
obtain his release.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Well, the talks were courteous and an agreement was reached, but there
happened to be other talks under way at the same time, on that same ship, and
these concerned the battle plans for that night's attack on <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> and on
<LOCATION>Fort McHenry</LOCATION>, which guarded the city. The British didn't know how much of
their plans Key and <PERSON>Dr. Beanes</PERSON> had overheard, and so they detained the
Americans until after the battle had commenced.;    From here on the story is,
or should be, rather well known by all American school children. Key was so
taken by the bombardment he witnessed from the deck of the ship that night
(the British lobbed more than 1,800 bombs and rockets into and around the
fort) and he was so stirred upon seeing the American flag still flying over
the fort at daybreak, that he hastily composed several verses of a poem on the
back of a letter or an envelope he found in his pocket.;    That poem, which
appeared shortly thereafter in a <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> newspaper under the title "The
Defense of <LOCATION>Fort McHenry</LOCATION>," became the words for what we know as "The
Star-Spangled Banner." The war in the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> has made the playing and
singing of our national anthem more common and frequent than just at the
beginning of sporting events.;    Many children know the words but have little
understanding of what some of those words mean. Parents can help put some of
the meaning and flavor back into this song by telling their children how the
anthem came to be written. (Be sure they see that the event, and the War of
<DATE>1812</DATE>, took place only about forty years after the Revolution, and so our
fledgling nation could easily have come under British rule once again if Fort
<ORGANIZATION>McHenry</ORGANIZATION> had fallen.) Recite the anthem to them like a poem, and translate for
them the following words and phrases:;    The Star-Spangled Banner: "Spangled"
means adorned with shining or glittering objects; sequins, for example, are
spangles.;    What so proudly we hailed: "Hailed" means cheered for or
applauded.;    O'er the ramparts we watched: "O'er" is the one-syllable,
poetic pronunciation of the word "over"; "ramparts" are protective barriers,
in this case the walls of <LOCATION>Fort McHenry.</LOCATION>;    The bombs bursting in air:
Explosives weren't actually dropped from above until <DATE>1849</DATE> (from balloons), and
so this early use of "bombs" refers to mortar shells that were launched over
the walls from the ground.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     As <PERSON>Madonna</PERSON> became a singing sensation, there were ripple effects in <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION>
in the life of <ORGANIZATION>Madonna Pride</ORGANIZATION>. The phone started ringing in the middle of the
night with callers wanting to talk to Madonna.;    When she ordered food by
phone, clerks often thought the call was a prank. A friend of her family who
works at the pizza parlor heard the following conversation.;    "Hey, <ORGANIZATION>Madonna</ORGANIZATION>
just placed an order," someone yelled in the restaurant after she had ordered
pizza.;    "Yeah, right," another employee quipped back, "and Elvis called up
for pizza, too.";    <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Madonna</ORGANIZATION> is the mother of three and a product of
Catholic schools. Sometimes when she says her name and adds that she works as
a bookkeeper for Sisters of the Holy Family, people think she's a nun.;    In
<ORGANIZATION>Price Club</ORGANIZATION> one day, <ORGANIZATION>Madonna</ORGANIZATION> had just finished paying for her items when the
checker waved the check in the air and yelled to another employee: "Hey Bob,
here's another star." The checker was talking to <ORGANIZATION>Price Club</ORGANIZATION> employee, <PERSON>Bob
Wagoner.</PERSON>;    "My daughter and her friends think it's cool that my name is
Madonna," says <ORGANIZATION>Madonna Pride.</ORGANIZATION>;    On her daughters' field trips if anyone gets
out of line, <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Madonna</ORGANIZATION> threatens to sing.;    "I think she's
outrageous, unique, a free spirit," says <ORGANIZATION>Madonna Pride</ORGANIZATION> about her more famous
namesake.;    <ORGANIZATION>Madonna</ORGANIZATION> is not the only one whose name gets attention in her
family. She's been married to Rusty Pride for more than 20 years. At a
marriage encounter follow-up years ago, another couple showed up just to see
what a Rusty Pride looked like.;    "It's just kind of fun," <ORGANIZATION>Madonna</ORGANIZATION> says
about their names. "I don't take it too seriously.";     IN A COLUMN a few
weeks ago about <PERSON>Ed Shannon</PERSON>'s son-in-law, who is an underwater photographer and
writer, I couldn't weave in a comment from Ed about his experience traveling
inland after scuba diving off the coast of <LOCATION>New Guinea.</LOCATION>;    In the highlands
where people still live as they did thousands of years ago with painted faces
and using bows and arrows, Ed asked what the older natives had thought of the
fighter planes that flew overhead during World War II.;    The sound signaled
giant bees droning overhead. The natives ran for cover in the jungles.;     IT
WAS THE car that <PERSON>Bob Wheeler</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION> courted <PERSON>Diane</PERSON> in before they were
married. During <PERSON>Bob</PERSON>'s military service, the car was resigned to a chicken barn
on a <LOCATION>Fresno</LOCATION> ranch <PERSON>Diane</PERSON>'s father owned.;    The <DATE>1956</DATE> Chevy that's been babied
and repainted and is in a never-ending process of being restored is headed for
its longest trip yet. Diane and Bob are driving the car across some of the
western states, as it is being passed from one generation to the next.;   
It's a gift from Dad to son, <PERSON>David</PERSON>, a recent graduate of <ORGANIZATION>Brigham Young
University</ORGANIZATION>, who adores the car as much as his father does.;    When she
started graduate work in library science, one of her mentors encouraged <PERSON>Lauren
Teixeira</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION> to look for vast resources as she studied the Costanoan
Indians.;    She developed a descriptive guide on "Access to Information on
Costanoan/Ohlone Indians of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Monterey Bay Areas</LOCATION>" as her
thesis and assembled a first of its kind resource guide on tribal organization
and the rancherias in <LOCATION>Mendocino County</LOCATION> in a grant project.;    For <PERSON>Lauren</PERSON>, a
five-year journey through school has ended. She finished two years
undergraduate work and three years of graduate studies to earn her master's
degree in library science from <LOCATION>San Jose State University</LOCATION> this month.;    With
the workload of family and her children's schedules, a job and studies
becoming unwieldy at times, she discovered an equally vast resource within
herself, through children's storytelling and writing of poetry.;    "A Lament:
From One Friend (Married with Children) to Another Friend (Single, No
Entanglements)" is one from her poetry collection that working mothers may
relate to:;    I envy you;    your solitude --;    Your house quietly filled; 
  with the color of your creativity;    flowing into every room;    filling
your universe infinitely you . . .;    While I make appointments;    for
solitude;    late at night;    in a sleeping house;    where I find my
creativity;    in sputters and spurts,;    splotches, splashes;    caught
somewhere between;    exhaustion and dreams.;    Since the two Teixeira
children, <PERSON>Zachary</PERSON> and <PERSON>Laural</PERSON>, are used to having a parent attending college,
their dad will finish his degree, starting full-time this month as he holds
down a full-time job.;     A YEAR OR SO ago, I wrote a column about <PERSON>Ray
Gatchalian</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>Oakland Fire Captain</ORGANIZATION>, who produced the video "Unheard Voices"
that aired on <ORGANIZATION>PBS</ORGANIZATION> about the children of war-ravaged <LOCATION>El Salvador.</LOCATION>;    <PERSON>Ray</PERSON>, who
can't sit still, is running across the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, having left on Flag Day
from the <PERSON>Francis Scott Key Monument</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Golden Gate Park</LOCATION> with 19 other runners
who plan to hit the <PERSON>Francis Scott</PERSON> Key Bridge in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, D. C. on <DATE>July 2</DATE>.
As they run, <PERSON>Ray</PERSON> and the others carry a replica of the 15-star flag that flew
over <LOCATION>Fort McHenry</LOCATION> when it was being bombarded by the British in <DATE>1814</DATE>,
inspiration for <PERSON>Francis Scott Key</PERSON> to write the Star Spangled Banner. The run
across <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is designed to call attention and contribution to a <PERSON>Francis
Scott</PERSON> Key Memorial to be built at the foot of the bridge by <DATE>July 4</DATE>, 1993.;   
When I talked to <PERSON>Ray</PERSON> last, he was in <LOCATION>Vernal</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, having run through the
foothills of the Sierra, the high desert of <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> and heading through the
Rockies.;    "The sunsets, the sunrises, the landscape pastels. The horses and
birds. You get to hear everything come up in that golden hour as the sun
spreads its light," says Ray.;    "It's just incredible. When you're running
down the middle of the highway at one and two in the <TIME>morning</TIME>, with the Milky
Way blazing, it gives you an opportunity to think what <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is about."  </TEXT>

Bell-Jeff 
</P>
<P>
COACH: <PERSON>Steve Wahl</PERSON>, 1st season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 9-15; 4th in league, 5-5 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: <PERSON>Wahl</PERSON> replaces <PERSON>Joe Dunn</PERSON>, who stepped down after 12 seasons in 
<DATE>August</DATE> because of personal reasons. Three junior starters, swingman <PERSON>Brian Lee</PERSON> 
(6-foot-3), point guard <PERSON>Bryon Camacho</PERSON> (5-7) and guard <PERSON>Ignacio Castro</PERSON> (6-0) 
return. Wahl calls Lee the top all-around player. "He can play forward, guard 
or center and score and rebound," <PERSON>Wahl</PERSON> said. Camacho averaged 11.6 points a 
game last season and is the catalyst for an offense that will play an up-tempo 
game. "He makes everything go," said <PERSON>Wahl</PERSON>, who also coaches the boys' and 
girls' tennis teams. "We have good team speed and we want to take advantage of 
it." Two juniors, forward <PERSON>Damien Scott</PERSON> (6-2) and center <PERSON>Joe Bunning</PERSON> (6-5), 
round out the starting lineup. Scott and <PERSON>Bunning</PERSON> will be the dominant forces 
under the boards. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: The team, which did not participate in <DATE>summer</DATE> league because of <ORGANIZATION>Wahl</ORGANIZATION>'s 
late hiring, has eight underclassmen on its 12-man roster. "It's been difficult 
just trying to get it going with a new philosophy, but I think we'll come 
around once they catch on," <PERSON>Wahl</PERSON> said. Wahl believes <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>St. Francis</PERSON> 
and possibly <LOCATION>El Segundo</LOCATION> could contend for the league championship, but he 
believes that <PERSON>Bell-Jeff</PERSON> should finish no lower than third. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Harvard 
</P>
<P>
COACH: <PERSON>Greg Hilliard</PERSON>, 6th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 23-3; 1st in league, 10-0 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Seven players return from last season's <LOCATION>San Fernando Valley 
League</LOCATION> championship team, which advanced to the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Section 3-A Division</ORGANIZATION> 
semifinals. Forward Andres Carlo (6-4) and center <PERSON>Spencer Miller</PERSON> (6-8), both 
seniors, are returning starters. Carlo played in all 26 games, averaging 10 
points, 8.8 rebounds, 2.8 steals and 1.5 blocks. Carlo and <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> should be 
strong inside forces, but <PERSON>Hilliard</PERSON> said that <PERSON>Carlo</PERSON> also is an effective outside 
threat. Iheanyi Uwaezouke (6-2), a Division I football prospect, and <PERSON>Marcus 
Puhvel</PERSON> (6-5) received significant playing time as juniors. Newcomer <PERSON>Tarlin Ray</PERSON> 
(6-2), a junior point guard, rounds out the starting five. <PERSON>Hilliard</PERSON> said that 
Puhvel probably is the best outside shooter and that <PERSON>Uwaezouke</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ray</PERSON> are the 
best ballhandlers. Harvard averaged more than 85 points a game last season and 
<PERSON>Hilliard</PERSON> thinks this year's team can duplicate that effort. "We're definitely a 
running team with a full-pressure defense," <PERSON>Hilliard</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "Our strength is our conditioning and we have good athletes that have 
yet to be proven," said <PERSON>Hilliard</PERSON>, who has guided <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> to two league titles 
and four playoff berths in five seasons. "Last year's team was tight and 
cohesive and how well we come together will be the determining factor." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
St. <PERSON>Francis</PERSON> 
</P>
<P>
COACH: <PERSON>John Jordan</PERSON>, 4th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 7-15; 5th in league, 2-6 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: <PERSON>Kyle Barrett</PERSON> (6-3), <PERSON>Dave Landa</PERSON> (5-3) and <PERSON>Marty Konrad</PERSON> (6-3) 
return and are expected to play key roles. Barrett is the Golden Knights' main 
offensive threat and averaged 16.4 points last season. Landa, who averaged 
eight points and 5.1 assists, will play point guard. Konrad averaged seven 
rebounds last season. Junior Tory <PERSON>Carruthers</PERSON> (6-3) also will start. Four 
sophomores and two juniors with no varsity experience round out the team. 
"Hopefully, we can build around (<ORGANIZATION>Barrett</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Landa</PERSON> and Konrad) and find some other 
kids to help them out," <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON> believes that the basketball team will benefit from the move 
from the <ORGANIZATION>Del Rey League</ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION>San Fernando Valley League</ORGANIZATION> in the same manner as 
the football team, which improved from 1-9 to 7-4. But <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON> is unsure of what 
to expect. "I have no idea what we'll do," <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON> said. "We're so young. I'm 
not sure what kind of character this team is going to have." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
St. Genevieve 
</P>
<P>
COACH: <PERSON>Scott Smith</PERSON>, 3rd season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 2-20; 6th in league, 0-10 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Senior guards Jeff De La O (5-9) and <PERSON>Josh Smith</PERSON> (5-10) 
started last season and are among seven returning players. De La O, who 
averaged 10 points, will be relied upon for his offensive output. Smith will be 
the primary ballhandler. Junior center <PERSON>Pat Rodriguez</PERSON> (6-2) and junior <PERSON>John 
Hoffmann</PERSON> (6-2) and senior <PERSON>Victor Dionisio</PERSON> (5-11), both forwards, also will 
start. <PERSON>Pete Miranda</PERSON> (5-10), <PERSON>Dominic Parero</PERSON> (5-9) and <PERSON>Mike Robinson</PERSON> (6-1), a 
transfer from <LOCATION>Crespi</LOCATION>, also will be given extensive playing time. "We don't have 
any size so everybody is going to have to crash the boards," <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said. "Once 
we get the ball, we'll be all right." <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> says quickness is the team's most 
valuable asset and that he will utilize a motion offense. "We'll set screens 
and try to roll out of them." 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: <ORGANIZATION>St. Genevieve</ORGANIZATION> should be improved, but <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> believes the league, in 
particular <PERSON>St. Francis</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Harvard</LOCATION>, is very strong. "It was a long season and 
we didn't get any wins (last year)," <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said, "but we have only one way to 
go. We don't have any outstanding individual, but we work well as a team."

AUGMON ACCOMPLISHES TASK: RENDERING WEAPON HARMLESS

<P>
Forward <PERSON>Stacey Augmon</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Nevada Las Vegas</LOCATION> is always assigned to check the 
toughest opposing player. When <ORGANIZATION>UNLV</ORGANIZATION> faced <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Tech</ORGANIZATION> in an <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> tournament 
semifinal game <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, he was assigned to <PERSON>Dennis Scott</PERSON>, the top gun in 
<ORGANIZATION>Georgia Tech</ORGANIZATION>'s Lethal Weapon 3 offense. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big challenge," <PERSON>Augmon</PERSON> said. "I knew he was looking forward to 
playing against me and he took the challenge and came out launching. I couldn't 
stop him in the first half." 
</P>
<P>
Scott scored 20 points in the first 20 minutes as <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Tech</ORGANIZATION> took a 53-46 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Augmon</PERSON> limited <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> to nine points in the second half as the Rebels won, 
90-81, to advance to the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> championship game <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> against <ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"Stacey played great defense in the <DATE>second half</DATE>," guard <PERSON>Anderson Hunt</PERSON> said. "He 
knew what he had to do." 
</P>
<P>
What <PERSON>Augmon</PERSON> had to do was play more aggressively against <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
After making five of eight shots in the first half, including four three-point 
shots, <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> didn't touch the ball in the <DATE>first five minutes of the second half</DATE> 
because of <PERSON>Augmon</PERSON>. "He played great defense on me the <DATE>second half</DATE>," <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> said. 
"He denied me the ball. I think the whole Vegas team was denying us the ball 
and it got us out of our offense." 
</P>
<P>
Although <PERSON>Augmon</PERSON> did a good job on <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> in the <DATE>second half</DATE>, he thought he could 
have done a better job in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"Scott's a great player," <PERSON>Augmon</PERSON> said. "You can't take anything from him. He 
still got 29. The thing I tried to do was hold him to the lowest possible 
points. I can't go out and stop anyone. Great players are going to hit shots on 
anyone." 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Tarkanian</PERSON> thought <PERSON>Augmon</PERSON> was being too modest. 
</P>
<P>
"In all fairness to <LOCATION>Stacey</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> got quite a few of his points when we were in 
our zone," <PERSON>Tarkanian</PERSON> said. "It seemed like every time we went to a zone he hit 
a three-pointer and made us pay for it. I don't know how many he got directly 
off Stacey, but I'm sure half of them came off our zone." 
</P>
<P>
As the Rebels' best defensive player, <PERSON>Augmon</PERSON> said he takes more pride in his 
defense than his offense. And he has shut down some of the nation's best 
offensive players, such as <ORGANIZATION>Temple</ORGANIZATION> guard <PERSON>Mark Macon</PERSON>, who had 11 points before 
fouling out in a loss to <ORGANIZATION>UNLV</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Although <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Tech</ORGANIZATION> Coach <PERSON>Bobby Cremins</PERSON> praised the aggressive defense <PERSON>Augmon</PERSON> 
played on <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>, he felt <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> stopped himself in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew <PERSON>Stacey</PERSON> couldn't stop <PERSON>Dennis Scott</PERSON> overall," <PERSON>Cremins</PERSON> said. "He's a heck 
of a defender, but no one can stop <PERSON>Dennis Scott</PERSON>. The only one who can stop 
<PERSON>Dennis Scott</PERSON> is <PERSON>Dennis Scott</PERSON>. But <PERSON>Augmon</PERSON> is a good athlete." 
</P>
<P>
After opening the game in a zone defense, <ORGANIZATION>UNLV</ORGANIZATION> switched to a man-to-man defense 
at the start of the second half. The defense seemed to confuse <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Tech</ORGANIZATION>, 
which shot <PERCENT>66.7%</PERCENT> in the first half. The Yellow Jackets shot just <PERCENT>34.5%</PERCENT> in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the second half we played really well defensively," <PERSON>Tarkanian</PERSON> said. 
"We got after it real good and we shut down a lot of things. The first half we 
didn't play with the intensity we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels opened the second half with a 17-4 run as <PERSON>Augmon</PERSON> scored five points. 
While <PERSON>Augmon</PERSON> is recognized for his defense, he also is a good offensive player 
as he proved last <DATE>Sunday</DATE> by scoring 33 points against <ORGANIZATION>Loyola Marymount</ORGANIZATION> and 
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> with 22 against <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Tech</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I take more pride in my defense than my offense," <PERSON>Augmon</PERSON> said. "A lot of 
people say I should take more pride in my offense because it will take me 
farther in life. 
</P>
<P>
"But my role on this team is as the defensive stopper and to put a little 
points on the board and that's what I did. I enjoy playing defense." 
</P>
<P>
While <ORGANIZATION>UNLV</ORGANIZATION>'s defense might have been the key, the Rebels' perimeter offense 
came to the fore after <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Tech</ORGANIZATION> made a run late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Georgia Tech</ORGANIZATION>'s sagging defense took away <ORGANIZATION>UNLV</ORGANIZATION>'s inside game as forward <PERSON>Larry 
Johnson</PERSON> got into foul trouble. But the Rebels picked up their outside game, 
making 10 of 15 three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt, who had 20 points, broke out of a slump by making five of nine 
three-point shots and <PERSON>Greg Anthony</PERSON> made three of four and scored 14 points.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Arts: Celebration gives food for thought - William Packer
visits Paris for two exhibitions with very different views on British
painting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
D'outre-Manche, not quite 'Across', as we have it, but 'Beyond the Channel',
with its faint hint at a somewhat greater psychological barrier, is a
fascinating and even shocking exhibition.
Here is no full and scholarly study of its subject and period - British art
up to the time of Queen <PERSON>Victoria</PERSON> - drawn from the wealth of French public
taste and connoisseurship. But, rather, a parade of historic French
attitudes and assumptions upon the art of our fog-shrouded and barbarous
land, that amounts to a confession.
If that wealth is not drawn upon, it is because that wealth is not there.
The French have never bothered to acquire the art of the British school  -
the distinction between the English, the Irish and the Scots is seldom made,
and ecole Anglais usually stands for all - in any substantial or
comprehensive fashion, for they have never taken our visual culture
seriously. And what they do not take seriously, they do not choose to
understand.
The contrast between our own <ORGANIZATION>National Gallery</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION> in generosity
of interest and critical even-handedness, could hardly be greater.
In <ORGANIZATION>Trafalgar Square</ORGANIZATION> we find an account of the post-Renaissance European
tradition that gives each national school its due, the French along with the
Italian, the Spanish, the Dutch and, yes, the British. What gaps there are,
as in the German and northern schools, they are admitted and, as far as
limited resources allow, addressed.
Never so, it would seem, along the quai du <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION>. 'How did I find the
show?' asked my friend in the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION>'s service presse, a little anxiously,
and gave at once her own pre-emptive answer: 'il y a beaucoup des trous.'
The show does contain some lovely things, with the magnificent <PERSON>Gainsborough</PERSON>
full-length of Lady <PERSON>Alston</PERSON>, green silk and grey shawl against a darkly
romantic setting, the best of all.
There are some good <PERSON>Reynolds</PERSON>, a decent <PERSON>Stubbs</PERSON> of <PERSON>Lord Curzon</PERSON> and his horse,
the splendid 'Captain Hay of Spott' by <PERSON>Raeburn</PERSON> and any number of <LOCATION>Lawrences</LOCATION> -
<PERSON>Lawrence</PERSON> after all was the painter of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s grandees in the
post-Napoleonic dispensation and was for a generation the best-known English
painter of them all.
But we know, and at heart the French know, that there is more to the British
School than the brief flourish of the late-Georgian swagger portrait.
So where do we begin? Neither with <PERSON>Holbein</PERSON> nor yet with <PERSON>Van Dyck</PERSON>, for they
are foreigners, so a fine full-length of <ORGANIZATION>Edward VI</ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON>William Scrots</PERSON>, a
Dutchman, will do.
What then of the Elizabethan miniaturists, <PERSON>Hilliard</PERSON> perhaps? But there is,
it seems, no <PERSON>Hilliard</PERSON> in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, and a single, exquisite portrait of the
fated <ORGANIZATION>Earl of Essex</ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON>Isaac Oliver</PERSON>, a Frenchman, must do. Into the <DATE>17th
century</DATE> we go, and to the Cavaliers and the Restoration, so with no <ORGANIZATION>Van
Dyck</ORGANIZATION>, what about <PERSON>Dobson</PERSON>? No <PERSON>Dobson</PERSON>, but a little later there is Lely. Wasn't
he a foreigner, too?
Never mind. The <DATE>18th century</DATE> will sort things out. <PERSON>Philippe Mercier</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Heinrich Fussli</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Fuseli</ORGANIZATION> to us) are in, I see. Odd that. But we shall really
get going with <PERSON>Hogarth</PERSON>, shan't we, surely the first great painter of the
truly English school. Shan't we?
But the French, we find, have this funny idea that <PERSON>Hogarth</PERSON> wasn't really a
painter at all, but an engraver - and indeed this show reveals the curious
fixed idea that it was in the general commercial development of print-making
that our peculiarly English talents were declared.
So there is not a single <PERSON>Hogarth</PERSON> painting in the show, but only the engraved
version of the 'Marriage a la Mode'. <PERSON>Thomas Girtin</PERSON> is represented by a
single acquatint of the 'Porte Saint <PERSON>Denis</PERSON>', <PERSON>Rowlandson</PERSON> by three satirical
etchings among a group by <PERSON>Gillray</PERSON> and <PERSON>Cruikshank</PERSON>. That group is at least
included, bitterly anti-French as its satires are.
What else? A few good water-colours by <LOCATION>Bonington</LOCATION>, Constable, Boys and Cox,
miscellaneous drawings, some good oils including a Bonington 'Doges'
Palace', Constable's '<LOCATION>Weymouth Bay</LOCATION>' and '<ORGANIZATION>Helmingham Dell</ORGANIZATION>', and a late
unfinished Turner landscape, vaporous and magical.
And that, of any substance, is it. This is, indeed, a show which gives us
rather more to think about than actually to see.
The smaller show at the <ORGANIZATION>Musee Carnavalet</ORGANIZATION> is a wonderful corrective, if only
because the prejudice is openly celebrated in terms that are often as hugely
enjoyable as they are grotesque.
A run of post-Napoleonic jokes about French girls finding any excuse to peer
up the kilts of Scottish soldiers gets us off to a good start and there is
no looking back, or down.
Randy rost-bifs and their prim, boot-faced wives on the one hand, seductive
girls and effete 'frogs' on the other, the ancient mutual stereotypes are
funny still.
But jokes apart, the show does make the serious point that the English love
affair with <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> had its cultural aspect, and bore real fruit in the work
of our tourist painters. Thus represented here are not only the better-known
figures of <ORGANIZATION>Turner</ORGANIZATION>, Cox, <LOCATION>Bonington</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Girtin</PERSON> and Boys, but also such
comparatively minor, but still accomplished, artists as <LOCATION>Holland</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Wyld</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>Callow</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Chalon</LOCATION> . . . and we think on to <LOCATION>Whistler</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sickert</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Nicholson</PERSON> . . .
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> to us, and <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> above all, has always been irresistible.
D'outre-Manche - British art in French public collections: Musee du <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> 1e, until <DATE>December 19</DATE>. Les Anglais a <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> au 19e siecle: <ORGANIZATION>Musee
Carnavalet</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> 4e, until <DATE>December 11</DATE>.

<TEXT>
   If <PERSON>Ernest Hemingway</PERSON> _ that aficionado of big
guns, feisty bulls, lusty reds and really short sentences _ were
alive today, the pugnacious Papa would be spoiling for a fight.
   The object of his disaffection would be ``The Best of Bad
Hemingway'' (<ORGANIZATION>Harcourt Brace Jovanovich</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>$7.95</MONEY>), a compilation of
the best entries to a now-defunct annual competition of Hemingway
parodies. The ersatz <PERSON>Ernest</PERSON> contest was sponsored by <ORGANIZATION>Harry's Bar &amp;
American Grill</ORGANIZATION>, whose ingenious milking of an extremely tenuous
<PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> connection deserves induction into the Publicists' <PERSON>Hall</PERSON>
of Fame.
   Hemingway, who would have been 90 on <DATE>July 21</DATE>, was no stranger to
parody. His second novel, ``The Torrents of <DATE>Spring</DATE>,'' was a cruel
mimickry of <PERSON>Sherwood Anderson</PERSON>, an early mentor <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> thought
was washed up. But when his own prose became well enough known to
be parodied, <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> was hardly a sport.
   ``The parody is the last refuge of the frustrated writer,'' he
said after <PERSON>E.B. White</PERSON> spoofed him with a piece called ``Across the
Street and Into the Grill.'' ``The greater the work of literature,
the easier the parody. The step up from writing parodies is writing
on the wall above the urinal.''
   All of the Ernie-wannabees in this collection are long on puns
and short on commas. Among the titles: ``The Snooze of
Kilimanjaro,'' ``In Another Contra,'' ``Hills Like White
Heffalumps,'' ``The Old Man and the Seal,'' ``A Clean Well-Sighted
Ace,'' ``A Lean Well-Tighted Space'' and ``A Clean Well-Lighted
Race.''
   When author <PERSON>George Plimpton</PERSON>, who wrote the introduction to the
book, was asked in a recent interview to select a favorite entry,
he mentioned <PERSON>Daniel Hardy</PERSON>'s ``The Last Good Martini,'' which
mangles more than a half-dozen <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> titles in its few short
paragraphs:
   ```Do you want to order dinner?' said <PERSON>Nick</PERSON>. `They still serve
the big two-parted liver.'''
   And later: ```Do you remember <PERSON>George Tell</PERSON>?'
   ```Yes,' said <PERSON>Francis</PERSON>. `He was a swell bowler. For whom does
Tell bowl now?'''
   Plimpton also mentioned the parody by <PERSON>Lee Ewing</PERSON>, ``The Question
Hung in the Air'':
   ``He knew what they must do on this day. It was a month with no
R.
   ```Come,' he said. `It is the day of the running of the
oysters.'''
   Plimpton explains in his introduction that the parody contest
was dreamed up in <DATE>1978</DATE> by an advertising man named <PERSON>Paul Keye</PERSON> for
<ORGANIZATION>Harry's Bar &amp; American Grill</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Century City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, near <LOCATION>Beverly
Hills</LOCATION>.
   The American <PERSON>Harry</PERSON>'s was a replica of <ORGANIZATION>Harry</ORGANIZATION>'s Bar in <LOCATION>Florence</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>. Keye knew <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> never went to the <LOCATION>Harry</LOCATION>'s in <LOCATION>Florence</LOCATION>
but was a devotee of the original <PERSON>Harry</PERSON>'s Bar in <LOCATION>Venice</LOCATION> and often
featured it in his stories.
   His copy promoting the competition warned contestants that they
would have to face ``The White Bull That Is Paper With No Words on
It.'' All entries had to be limited to one type-written page and
had to mention <PERSON>Harry</PERSON>'s Bar _ favorably. The winner was flown to
<LOCATION>Florence</LOCATION> for dinner at the other <LOCATION>Harry</LOCATION>'s (lodging was not included).
   The thousands of entries that poured in took the contest
organizers by surprise, and the contest grew bigger every year,
with celebrity judges such as <LOCATION>Plimpton</LOCATION>, novelist <PERSON>Joseph Wambaugh</PERSON>,
science fiction writer <PERSON>Ray Bradbury</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jack Hemingway</PERSON>, the
author's son. Television crews gathered for the reading of the
winning entry. Harry's decided to end the competition after a
decade because it was devoting more time to running it than its
restaurants.
   <PERSON>Plimpton</PERSON> was asked what he looked for when he judged the entries.
   ``It has to be funny; it has to echo the style of author. I
think the skill in copying the primary source would be utmust, then
the imagination in developing the idea,'' he said by telephone from
his office at the <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> Review, of which he is editor.
   In later years the entries were pre-screened and the judges read
only the best entries.
   ``The Best of Bad Hemingway'' is rounded out by spoofs of the
author by well-known writers, including <PERSON>F. Scott Fitzgerald</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Raymond Chandler</PERSON> and <PERSON>Plimpton</PERSON> himself, whose ``The Snows of
Studiofiftyfour'' is a skillful mutation of <ORGANIZATION>Hemingway</ORGANIZATION>'s writing
style and a Truman Capote-esque sensibility.
   <PERSON>Gary Piepenbrink</PERSON>, who edited the collection for <PERSON>Harcourt Brace
Jovanovich</PERSON>, said he thought the book was fairly evenly divided
between those who parodied <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> because they loved him and
those who did it because they reviled him.
   Hemingway, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature in
<DATE>1954</DATE>, put a shotgun in his mouth and committed suicide in <DATE>1961</DATE>.
   ``He's a literary force that everyone will have reckoned with
somehow,'' said <PERSON>Piepenbrink</PERSON> in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION>San
Diego</LOCATION> office. ``His stature is not to be challenged. His place is
secure in modern literature.
   ``I don't think the collection diminishes <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>,'' said
<PERSON>Piepenbrink</PERSON>, who reveres the author. ``Some of the parodies are
pretty cruel, but he can take it. A lesser writer couldn't endure
all these punches.''

PREP NOTES / ROB FERNAS: BISHOP MONTGOMERY LOSES 11 PLAYERS -- BUT NOT SPIRIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rob Fernas 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As athletic director of <ORGANIZATION>Bishop Montgomery High</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Steve Carroll</PERSON> does a good job 
of promoting the school's attractive features. He speaks of the rigorous 
academic environment, the emphasis on discipline and the well-rounded sports 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, though, he has fought an uphill battle on the athletic front. 
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the year, <PERSON>Bishop Montgomery</PERSON>'s weight room has been 
burglarized of at least <MONEY>$6,000</MONEY> in equipment, 11 projected football starters 
have transferred and the basketball coach has resigned. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had some problems, without a doubt," <PERSON>Carroll</PERSON> said. "But I think our 
reputation speaks for itself. If a kid wants to get the best education he can 
and the best things athletically, he'll consider our school." 
</P>
<P>
But how will the school's recent problems affect athletics? 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bishop Montgomery</PERSON>, struggling to stay afloat in the competitive waters of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Angelus League</ORGANIZATION>, suffered its latest setback <DATE>Monday</DATE> when basketball Coach <PERSON>Tony 
Carter</PERSON> resigned after one season. His replacement will become the sixth 
basketball coach at the school in five years. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll hopes to find a new coach within three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing the losses incurred by the football team may be more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Since <PERSON>Carroll</PERSON> was named football coach earlier this year, the Knights have lost 
11 projected starters to other schools. Included in that group are three who 
now attend Banning, most notably All-Angelus League wide receiver <PERSON>Sheldon 
Butler</PERSON> and quarterback <PERSON>Marty Garcia</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Banning Coach <PERSON>Joe Dominguez</PERSON> says <PERSON>Butler</PERSON>, a junior, has a good chance of 
starting for the Pilots next season and <PERSON>Garcia</PERSON>, a sophomore, will probably back 
up returning All-Pacific League quarterback <PERSON>John Ma'ae</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, those are major losses for <ORGANIZATION>Bishop Montgomery</ORGANIZATION>, which has never 
qualified for the CIF-Southern Section playoffs from the <ORGANIZATION>Angelus League</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of dwelling on the losses, however, <PERSON>Carroll</PERSON> is determined to win with 
the remaining players. 
</P>
<P>
"We've taken our lumps, but the kids we have now are fantastic," he said. "I 
don't know if we're going to win the league title, but we're going to have a 
successful year one way or another. The kids are hard workers." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Carroll</PERSON> says the players who transferred left for a variety of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost (some) kids to academics, four or five to discipline problems and 
three or four because they have moved on to what they think are greener 
pastures," said the native Texan. "I was brought up in another age, I never 
thought about transferring schools. Down around here, it's rampant. 
</P>
<P>
"If a kid doesn't like the school or the coach, he can decide he wants to go 
somewhere else. I'm not in favor of it at all." 
</P>
<P>
Sources said <PERSON>Carroll</PERSON>, who succeeded <PERSON>Andy Szabatura</PERSON> as football coach after last 
season, alienated some players by implementing mandatory weightlifting for all 
levels. <PERSON>Carroll</PERSON> said mandatory lifting was limited to varsity players in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I did catch a few people off guard," he said. "You might lose a few kids 
in the beginning, but everybody seems to know the rules from then on and you 
don't have any more problems." 
</P>
<P>
For <PERSON>Carroll</PERSON>, that would be a welcomed change. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Carter</PERSON>, who coached <PERSON>Bishop Montgomery</PERSON>'s basketball team to a 9-13 record last 
season, said he resigned because of financial reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing negative about the job except the pay," he said. "I liked 
the administration and the faculty. I thought the basketball program would get 
better every year. I liked all the kids in the program." 
</P>
<P>
But he couldn't make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Carter</PERSON>, who has coached basketball for 10 years, including stints as an 
assistant at <ORGANIZATION>Cal State Dominguez Hills</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Torrance High</PERSON>, said he is going into 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"It got to the point where I wanted a little more financial security," he said. 
"There's not much security in coaching. I just wanted something that was more 
lucrative and has more conventional-type hours." 
</P>
<P>
Under <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>, the Knights opened the season with a 9-4 record but went 0-8 in 
the tough <ORGANIZATION>Angelus League</ORGANIZATION>, losing six games by six points or less. The team 
returns several key players, including all-league junior guard <PERSON>Darryl Daniels</PERSON>, 
who led the Knights with an 18-point scoring average. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Carter</PERSON> said he has recommended a few coaching candidates that he hopes the 
<PERSON>Bishop Montgomery</PERSON> administration will consider. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope they hire somebody I recommended because they would keep my same 
(assistant) coaches and have the same coaching philosophy. All four levels ran 
the same offense and defense last year. It's important to have continuity if 
you want to establish a winning program." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Carroll</PERSON> said the school is accepting applications for a new coach. 
</P>
<P>
"(<PERSON>Carter</PERSON>'s recommendations) are something we are considering," he said. "But 
we're not going to sacrifice for consistency. We're going to hire the best guy 
we can get." 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez, the Banning football coach, lost perhaps the best player in his 
program last <DATE>February</DATE> when All-L.A. City fullback <PERSON>Derek Sparks</PERSON> transferred to 
<ORGANIZATION>Montclair Prep</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Van Nuys</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
However, <PERSON>Dominguez</PERSON> isn't worried about replacing the talented sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
He says <PERSON>Travis Davis</PERSON>, a 6-foot, 185-pound sophomore with excellent speed, could 
be the next great Banning running back. Davis played defensive back for the 
Pilots last season and is perhaps best remembered for running down <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> 
wingback <PERSON>Larry Billoups</PERSON>, the Colts' fastest player, in the <LOCATION>L.A. City</LOCATION> 4-A 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's really going to be something," <PERSON>Dominguez</PERSON> said of <PERSON>Davis</PERSON>. "I 
wouldn't be surprised if he runs for 1,100 or 1,200 yards next year." 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger pitcher <PERSON>Tyrone Scott</PERSON>, a fourth-round draft choice of the <ORGANIZATION>Houston 
Astros</ORGANIZATION>, signed <DATE>last week</DATE> and will report to the Astros' rookie league affiliate 
in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> on <DATE>June 23</DATE>, the day after his graduation. Terms of <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>'s contract 
were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>

<HEAD>Pride II Departs On Maiden Voyage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VALERIE MEEHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The clipper schooner Pride of <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> II
departed on its maiden voyage <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, more than two years after the
original Pride sank in a sudden storm, killing four crew members.
   Like its predecessor, the vessel is modeled after those that
sailed the <LOCATION>Chesapeake Bay</LOCATION> in the <DATE>19th century</DATE> and will visit other
cities and foreign countries as <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>'s and <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>'s goodwill
ambassador.
   In order to meet <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> safety requirements for
carrying passengers, Pride II is almost one-third larger than the
original Pride and 64 tons heavier. Unlike the first Pride, it is
equipped with a second diesel motor, separate compartments for its
12 crew members, and a modern kitchen.
   At Capt. Jan Miles' order, the crew hoisted a replica of the
15-star, 15-stripe <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> flag that is believed to have flown over
nearby <LOCATION>Fort McHenry</LOCATION> during the War of <DATE>1812</DATE>; the flag that tradition
holds was still flying and inspired <PERSON>Francis Scott Key</PERSON> to pen the
national anthem.
   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> flag was quickly joined by the flags of <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> and a Pride of <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> II pennant.
   A shot was fired from a replica of a <DATE>19th century</DATE> cannon on the
starboard side, and the clipper schooner pulled away. It sailed
around the harbor with all five sails unfurled as thousands of
people watched from the shore. A small armada of about 50 private
boats followed the vessel for about an hour until it sailed past
<ORGANIZATION>Fort McHenry</ORGANIZATION> and under the <PERSON>Francis Scott</PERSON> Key Bridge.
   Before it returns to <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> <DATE>April 21</DATE>, the clipper schooner is
scheduled to travel to <LOCATION>Bermuda</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Galveston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>New
Orleans</LOCATION>; Mobile, <LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Jacksonville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Savannah</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>; North and <LOCATION>South
Carolina</LOCATION>; and <LOCATION>Norfolk</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va</LOCATION>.
   It was built with <MONEY>$4 million</MONEY> in donations and government money.
   The vessel was christened <DATE>April 30</DATE>, in memory of the captain and
three crew members who died when the Pride sank <DATE>May 14, 1986</DATE>, when
a sudden squall blew up 90 miles off the coast of <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>. The
eight survivors clung to a life raft for five days, rationed to a
bite of biscuit and a half cup of water daily.
   None of the original crew sailed with the Pride II on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.

LAKERS ARE NO LONGER HOME FREE; 
</P>
<P>
FORUM STREAK ENDS AT 17 AS NEW YORK WINS, 122-117 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pretensions of perfection at the Forum, which seemed a reasonable enough goal 
for the Lakers until now, went down in a hail of turnovers, failed shot 
attempts and defensive lapses in the final frenzied minutes <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. 
</P>
<P>
Moments after <ORGANIZATION>Magic Johnson</ORGANIZATION>'s final, futile 3-point attempt clanged off the 
back of the rim, the <LOCATION>New York Knicks</LOCATION>, those long-distance specialists from the 
<LOCATION>East</LOCATION>, ended the <ORGANIZATION>Lakers</ORGANIZATION>' 17-game home winning streak with a 122-117 victory 
before a sellout crowd of 17,505. 
</P>
<P>
There was a certain symmetry, it seemed, to this one. In <DATE>November</DATE>, the Lakers 
handed the Knicks what has turned out to be their only home loss. Now, the 
<ORGANIZATION>Lakers</ORGANIZATION> also are no longer invincible at home. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, their only loss at home is to us, and our only loss at home is to them," 
said <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>, who recorded his ninth triple-double of the season with 26 
points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Knick players talked of revenge after the Lakers beat them at <ORGANIZATION>Madison Square 
Garden</ORGANIZATION>. And after becoming the first team to beat the Lakers at home this 
season, the <LOCATION>Atlantic Division</LOCATION> leaders said it might prove important in the 
<DATE>spring</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"We proved we could stay with them on their home court," said Knick forward 
<PERSON>Gerald Wilkins</PERSON>, who scored 10 of his 14 points in the <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE> and had an 
important steal in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
"That could mean a lot should we face them somewhere down the line in the 
playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
To that, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> shrugged and said the Knicks are capable of being in such a 
playoff position. But <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> also has heard such motivational talk from many 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's after you," <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said. "It goes with the territory." 
</P>
<P>
It took a little more than 44 minutes, but the Knicks finally invaded the 
<ORGANIZATION>Lakers</ORGANIZATION>' inner sanctum and took a 114-113 lead on <PERSON>Patrick Ewing</PERSON>'s 2 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
The teams exchanged baskets for the next few possessions before Laker turnovers 
and missed shots were converted by the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
With the Knicks holding a 116-115 lead and the Lakers in possession, guard 
<PERSON>Byron Scott</PERSON> passed where no Laker was near the ball, <PERSON>Mychal Thompson</PERSON> leaving 
the area for a backdoor cut to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks took full advantage. <PERSON>Mark Jackson</PERSON> made 2 free throws, giving <LOCATION>New 
York</LOCATION> a 118-115 lead. But after <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>'s inside basket brought the Lakers 
within 1 again, <PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> continued his fourth-quarter assault. 
</P>
<P>
With the ball at the top of the key, <PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> faked <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> to the left, then 
drove right for an easy layup. The basket put the Knicks ahead, 120-117, with 
2:07 to play. The score remained that way until there were 4 seconds left, when 
<PERSON>Charles Oakley</PERSON> made 2 free throws. In the more than 2 minutes between, the 
Lakers looked like the inexperienced team and the Knicks the reliable veterans. 
After handling <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s trapping defense most of the game, getting easy 
layups after breaking the press, the Lakers broke down when it mattered most. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers had the ball with 54 seconds left, when Coach <PERSON>Pat Riley</PERSON> called a 
timeout. When play resumed, the Lakers isolated <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>, with the ball, and 
<PERSON>James Worthy</PERSON> was posting low with <PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> draped all over him. Johnson passed 
once to Worthy, who quickly returned it. But when <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> tried to repeat the 
sequence, <PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> had slipped around Worthy and intercepted the ball. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out that the Lakers would get another chance to tie, after the 
Knicks' <PERSON>Trent Tucker</PERSON> missed an outside shot with 28 seconds remaining. But 
<PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> missed a 3-point shot, the rebound deflecting off 2 Knick players and 
out of bounds. It was Laker ball with 17 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of trying for a 3-pointer, the Lakers this time went inside to 
<PERSON>Thompson</PERSON>, who missed an uncontested shot. The ball was batted out to <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>, 
standing alone just beyond the 3-point line. 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>'s shot was long, and Worthy fouled <PERSON>Oakley</PERSON> while going for the 
rebound. Oakley made both free throws to close out the Knicks' win. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers lost despite shooting <PERCENT>54.5%</PERCENT> (to the Knicks' <PERCENT>53.3%</PERCENT>), outrebounding 
the Knicks, 39-35, and outplaying them for most of the game. 
</P>
<P>
But the <ORGANIZATION>Lakers</ORGANIZATION>' downfall came at the end, when they simply could not handle the 
Knicks' pressure. <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>Rick Pitino</PERSON> said the Knicks wore out the 
Lakers, but <PERSON>Riley</PERSON> said fatigue was not a factor. 
</P>
<P>
"We made too many mental mistakes down the stretch," said <PERSON>Riley</PERSON>, whose team 
also got 26 points from Worthy and 21 from <ORGANIZATION>A.C. Green</ORGANIZATION>. "We made 2 or 3 
turnovers in the last 2 minutes, and you can't expect to win when you do that. 
</P>
<P>
"We were ahead <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> of the time, but we made some defensive mistakes, and <PERSON>Gerald 
Wilkins</PERSON> got off on us. Byron threw one away, and <PERSON>James</PERSON> and Buck (<PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>) 
couldn't get together on that pass in the post. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it was fatigue. I think we played well enough to win most of the 
time. But unless you do it all the time, you can't beat a team like the 
Knicks." 
</P>
<P>
Said <PERSON>Pitino</PERSON>: "The Lakers played as well or better against our press than any 
team has all season. I told our players at the half that fatigue would be the 
key factor in the <DATE>second half</DATE>, and the team that had the best legs would win. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew they gave everything in the first half, and we knew our best was yet 
to come." 
</P>
<P>
Ewing scored 25 points, and <PERSON>Oakley</PERSON> got 23 points and 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks weren't too bad in the first half, either. They never led, but that 
did not mean they played poorly. 
</P>
<P>
Every time the Knicks threatened, the Lakers responded with surges that enabled 
them to take a 69-63 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Lakers</ORGANIZATION>' biggest first-half lead was 10 points late in the <DATE>first quarter</DATE>, 
when <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> completed a fast break with a dunk. Thompson hung onto the rim 
for a moment before crashing to the floor. His feet out in front of him, 
<PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> landed squarely on his back and remained there until play could be 
stopped. 
</P>
<P>
He stayed in the lineup, and the Lakers held the lead, although the Knicks cut 
it to 4 by the end of the quarter, mainly on long-range shooting. <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> 
outscored the <LOCATION>Lakers</LOCATION>, 10-4, in the final 2 minutes of the period, led by 
<PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> with 2 3-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks pulled within a point of the Lakers five times midway through the 
<DATE>second quarter</DATE>. But each time the Knicks threatened, the Lakers responded, 
<ORGANIZATION>Green</ORGANIZATION> and Worthy leading the offense. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the Knicks' best chance gone awry came after <ORGANIZATION>Green</ORGANIZATION> made only 1 free 
throw to give the Lakers a 57-55 lead with 3:40 to play in the first half. But 
<PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> missed an open jumper, and then the Knicks were called for their second 
illegal defense violation in the half, resulting in a technical foul. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson made the technical, then <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> rebounded a missed shot and scored 
inside for a 60-55 Laker lead. Oakley, arguing that a foul should have been 
called, was given a technical foul. Johnson then made another technical for a 
6-point Laker lead. 
</P>
<P>
After a Knick turnover, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> scored on a fast-break layup to increase the 
lead to 8. 
</P>
<P>
But with a team saturated with 3-point shooters and strong inside players such 
as <PERSON>Ewing</PERSON> and <PERSON>Oakley</PERSON>, the Knicks could not be counted out, even after the Lakers 
extended the lead to 99-91 entering the <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have played better down the stretch," <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said. "It was mental 
mistakes. They did a great job. They have the best trap in the league. And in 
the <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE>, we just didn't attack it." 
</P>
<P>
So, the <ORGANIZATION>Lakers</ORGANIZATION>' quest for a 41-0 record at the Forum ended in home game number 
18. Perhaps it had just been wishful thinking all along, because they didn't 
seem crushed to see it end. 
</P>
<P>
"This one's history," <PERSON>Riley</PERSON> said. "I don't want to dismiss it, but it's over."

JACK SMITH: THOMAS JEFFERSON DECLARED UNDER THE INFLUENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have received a complimentary copy of a magazine called Heads Up, a 
publication of the <ORGANIZATION>Beer Drinkers of America</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
If all the beer drinkers in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> are members of that organization, it must 
be very large indeed, and very powerful politically. It is more likely, I 
suspect, that its members are in the brewing industry. 
</P>
<P>
I do not qualify, by habit, for membership (I generally drink wine), but I am 
amused by the industry's pretensions to patriotism. The cover shows three men 
in Colonial costume examining a document written on parchment. They are in a 
tavern before a great fireplace. Their table holds two full beer mugs and one 
lighted candle. In the table of contents it is noted that this scene was 
"re-created" in <LOCATION>Gulliver</LOCATION>'s restaurant in <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
I am always glad to learn some previously unknown tidbit of American history, 
so I was surprised but not displeased to learn in an article called "Ye Old 
Public Taverns Were a <ORGANIZATION>Source of Inspiration</ORGANIZATION>, Warmth . . . and American Liberty" 
that <PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON> actually wrote one of his drafts of the Declaration of 
Independence in a tavern. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was he in a tavern, he was drinking ale. I quote: 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON> sat at the <ORGANIZATION>Indian Queen Tavern</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> facing a blank 
sheet of parchment. Taking a long drink of his freshly poured ale, he touched 
his pen to paper and scratched, 'When in the course of human events . . . . ' " 
</P>
<P>
It is fascinating to think that <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> may have been a little tipsy when he 
wrote that most cherished of American documents. Perhaps the ale accounts for 
his misspelling of "inalienable" as "unalienable," an error that has been 
perpetuated in copies of the declaration to the present day. It is said that 
<PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> in his other writings spelled the word "inalienable." 
</P>
<P>
We may also wonder whether it was the ale, and the tavern setting, that caused 
<PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> to omit women from his phrase, "We hold these truths to be 
self-evident; that all men are created equal. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
In his biography, "Jefferson the Virginian," <PERSON>Dumas Malone</PERSON> notes that in his 
original draft <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> had written "We hold these truths to be sacred and 
undeniable," but this rhetorical flare-up was toned down later, either by 
<PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> himself or by <PERSON>Benjamin Franklin</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, though <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> may have been under the influence of ale when he 
composed it, his declaration has stood the test of time. As <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> says, "No 
other American document has been read so often or listened to by so many weary 
and perspiring audiences. Yet, despite interminable repetition, those well-worn 
phrases have never lost their potency and charm." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly a close second to the declaration would be Lincoln's "Gettysburg 
Address," which he wrote on one sheet of paper before leaving the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> 
for the cemetery. He made some revisions the night before the talk. Oddly, the 
phrase "under God," in "this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of 
freedom," did not appear in his original copies. He ad libbed them. But they 
appear in all subsequent copies. One thing I doubt seriously, is that Lincoln 
had drunk any beer or spiritous liquor while he was composing it. 
</P>
<P>
Heads Up also notes that the flag that inspired <PERSON>Francis Scott Key</PERSON> to write "The 
Star-Spangled Banner" in <DATE>1814</DATE> was sewn by <PERSON>Mary Young Pickersgill</PERSON> on the floor 
of a <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> brewery. 
</P>
<P>
In an article on "<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s No. 1 Song" (<LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>, <DATE>July, 1986</DATE>) <PERSON>Daniel Mark 
Epstein</PERSON> explains that <PERSON>Mary</PERSON>'s sewing room was too small for the flag, which was 
30 feet high and 42 feet wide, so she and her little daughter worked on their 
hands and knees on the malt-house floor of <ORGANIZATION>Claggett's Brewery</ORGANIZATION>. They finished 
just as the British fleet was approaching <LOCATION>Baltimore Harbor</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Key was a prisoner of the British during that night of rockets red glare and 
bombs bursting in air, and at dawn, when he saw the flag still flying, he wrote 
his poem on an envelope. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was the flag sewn on a brewery floor, but the poem was set to the tune 
of an English drinking song, "To Anacreon in Heaven," a hymn to the ancient 
Greek poet Anacreon, who loved wine and lovemaking above all else. <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> 
gentlemen spent nights of alcoholic singing and revelry in his memory. 
</P>
<P>
According to Heads Up, Key's words were published on a handbill the next day 
and were soon "being sung in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> taverns." 
</P>
<P>
So "The Star-Spangled Banner" is a dubious national anthem, not only because of 
its libertine origin, but also because of its notoriously out-of-reach high 
notes and low notes, on which the best voices -- pop, operatic and rock -- 
routinely founder; also, it can not be marched to. 
</P>
<P>
I don't drink beer when I write. If I did, I'd probably write phrases like "We 
hold these truths to be sacred and undeniable."

DOMINGUEZ HILLS SLUGGER HAS POP IN HIS BAT, SPEED TO BOOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The name is the same, and so is the game. But that is where the similarities 
end. <PERSON>George Scott III</PERSON>, who plays outfield for <ORGANIZATION>Cal State Dominguez Hills</ORGANIZATION>, is 
indeed the son of <PERSON>George Scott</PERSON>, the one-time <ORGANIZATION>American League</ORGANIZATION> home run champion 
who hit 271 homers during a 14-year major league career. 
</P>
<P>
When his dad played he was known as the Boomer because he weighed 225 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The younger <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>, a trimmed-down version of his dad, was a track standout in 
high school who didn't begin playing baseball until his senior year. He has a 
sprinter's speed and is vying for the Toros' lead in stolen bases. "We list him 
at 180 pounds but he's probably closer to 165," said a school official. He's 
known to teammates as the Baby Boomer. 
</P>
<P>
Scott grew up in <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> while his father gained fame with the <ORGANIZATION>Boston Red 
Sox</ORGANIZATION>. After playing at <ORGANIZATION>New Bedford High</ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> area, he attended 
Miami-Dade's community college, where he stole 53 bases in two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
His parents divorced and his mother, <PERSON>Malvine</PERSON>, became engaged to an employee at 
<ORGANIZATION>Dominguez Hills</ORGANIZATION>. Scott followed last <DATE>summer</DATE> and showed up as a walk-on for 
baseball, a pleasant surprise for <ORGANIZATION>Coach George Wing</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Wing described <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> as "electrifying . . . <PERSON>George</PERSON>'s speed is an intimidating 
factor." 
</P>
<P>
Scott agrees that speed is his game. "My dad is a power hitter," he said. "He's 
a home-run hitter and an RBI man. I'm a leadoff batter and known more for my 
speed." 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> had a power-hitter's swing when he arrived at <LOCATION>Dominguez Hills</LOCATION>, a 
problem Wing has tried to correct. The work to shorten his swing is paying 
dividends, as <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> is hitting .349, has a team-high 52 hits and has stolen 14 
bases, one behind team leader <PERSON>Robert Campbell</PERSON>. Thirteen of <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>'s 22 RBIs have 
come with two outs. The Toros are 13-19 going into tonight's game at <LOCATION>Cal State 
Los Angeles</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Wing has also worked with <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>, a right-hand batter, on switch-hitting. He 
hasn't tried it in a game. 
</P>
<P>
Scott is making a name for himself in the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Collegiate Athletic Assn</ORGANIZATION>. 
and, he hopes, beyond. If he follows his father's footsteps, it will be done 
with speed, not strength. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Marymount basketball standout <PERSON>Bo Kimble</PERSON> made a strong showing at the 
<ORGANIZATION>Orlando Classic</ORGANIZATION>, an all-star series in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> <DATE>last week</DATE> showcasing college 
seniors for pro scouts. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kimble</PERSON> was named to the all-tournament team after leading in steals. He also 
got a chance to play point guard in a practice to show he is comfortable in a 
set-up game, which <ORGANIZATION>Loyola</ORGANIZATION> has rarely played. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal was to show scouts a universal game, everything but offense," <PERSON>Kimble</PERSON> 
said. "I didn't concentrate on scoring at all. I think I surprised some scouts, 
that I can play good halfcourt man-to-man defense. They never had a chance to 
see me play that way." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kimble</PERSON> managed to rank among the top scorers, leading the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> team in two of 
three games. He played with a sprained left thumb suffered in the semifinal.

<PERSON>Kimble</PERSON>, who led the nation in scoring with a 35.7-point average and had an 
outstanding <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> tournament, didn't need to play in the all-star series. But 
<PERSON>Kimble</PERSON> and his agent, <PERSON>David Spencer</PERSON>, thought it would enhance his standing for 
the <DATE>June</DATE> draft. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I guaranteed myself a lottery pick," <PERSON>Kimble</PERSON> said. "I moved up in the 
draft. It worked out to my best interest." 
</P>
<P>
Spencer, who recruited <PERSON>Kimble</PERSON> out of high school for <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, said: "I don't think 
there's any question he helped himself. It was a chance for people to see him 
in a more normal-type game than a <LOCATION>Loyola</LOCATION> game. One (NBA) general manager told 
me, 'You've got the best guy here.' "

<ORGANIZATION>American Pro Soccer League</ORGANIZATION>, which includes the South Bay-based <LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION> Heat. 
Militello, who was the <ORGANIZATION>South Coast Conference</ORGANIZATION> player of the year and a

MATER DEI'S NO. 1 AGAIN; ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THE SPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago, the <ORGANIZATION>Mater Dei High School</ORGANIZATION> baseball team won 21 games with a 
talented outfield of <PERSON>Mike Basse</PERSON>, <PERSON>Larry Sutton</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jim Austin</PERSON>, all of whom 
signed with Division I colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, <ORGANIZATION>Mater Dei</ORGANIZATION> won 22 games with an equally talented pitching staff that 
featured <PERSON>Tony Pena</PERSON> (12-1) and <PERSON>Scott Corliss</PERSON> (7-2). 
</P>
<P>
This season, <ORGANIZATION>Mater Dei</ORGANIZATION> should continue its winning ways with a stellar infield 
that Coach <PERSON>Bob Ickes</PERSON> thinks could be comparable to his previous outfield and 
pitching stars. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei, which finished second in the county poll the past two seasons, is 
the top-ranked team in The Times' preseason baseball poll. 
</P>
<P>
1. MATER DEI 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop <PERSON>Lionel Hastings</PERSON>, a gifted hitter with a strong arm, is the catalyst 
of the infield. <PERSON>Hastings</PERSON> has made an oral commitment to <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Ickes</PERSON> thinks he 
will start for the Trojans as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
First baseman <PERSON>Jim McCarthy</PERSON>, sidelined with injuries the past two years, finally 
gets his chance to play. <PERSON>Doug DeJardin</PERSON> starts at second base and <PERSON>Ryan Andersen</PERSON> 
is at third. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all Division I prospects," <PERSON>Ickes</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei, 6-2 with losses to <LOCATION>Capistrano Valley</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION>, is batting .350 as 
a team. In the recent Newport-Tustin tournament, Mater Dei scored 23 runs in 
the championship game against Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
"Year in and year out, we're going to score runs," <PERSON>Ickes</PERSON> said. "But we've never 
been questionable on the mound. We don't have a No. 1 on the mound, they're all 
equal. We're just hoping for consistency." 
</P>
<P>
Pena, the county's player of the year in <DATE>1989</DATE>, is now at <ORGANIZATION>Arizona State</ORGANIZATION>. Three 
starters -- <PERSON>Jason Deitrick</PERSON>, <PERSON>Colin Gawlonski</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sean Sutton</PERSON> -- are vying for 
the top spot in the Mater Dei rotation. <PERSON>Mike Ferletic</PERSON> is the team's top relief 
pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"I've used eight pitchers," <PERSON>Ickes</PERSON> said. "We knew going into the season we were 
undermanned, but our depth could confuse some teams if we use the right pitcher 
in the right situation." 
</P>
<P>
Despite an inexperienced pitching staff, <PERSON>Ickes</PERSON> likes his team's chances 
</P>
<P>
"We had the same question marks in <DATE>1980</DATE> with our pitching staff, and we went 
all the way (won the 4-A title) that year," he said. "You just never know." 
</P>
<P>
2. OCEAN VIEW 
</P>
<P>
A trio of talented left-handed pitchers -- <PERSON>Randy Karliner</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jim Gwaltney</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Eric Schaff</PERSON> -- gives <ORGANIZATION>Ocean View</ORGANIZATION> one of the best starting rotations in the 
county. <PERSON>Karliner</PERSON> won eight of 11 games as a sophomore and was a first-team 
all-league selection last year. <PERSON>Schaff</PERSON> was injured most of last season but is 
one of the most improved players on the team. 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop <PERSON>Daniel Hernandez</PERSON> batted .378 and was a Times' all-county selection as 
a junior last year. Few can match <PERSON>Hernandez</PERSON>'s defensive skills in the infield 
and he is expected to attract a lot of attention from major league scouts. 
</P>
<P>
Coach <PERSON>Steve Barrett</PERSON> thinks <PERSON>Scott Caringella</PERSON> is the best outfielder in the 
<ORGANIZATION>Sunset League</ORGANIZATION>. "Pitching, pitching and more pitching will be our strength," 
<PERSON>Barrett</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View was the runner-up in the 32-team Loara tournament last week, losing 
to nationally ranked <LOCATION>Lakewood</LOCATION>, 9-3, in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
3. KATELLA 
</P>
<P>
Returning all-league third baseman <PERSON>Dennis Briggs</PERSON> and shortstop <PERSON>Jamie Vitzelio</PERSON> 
give Katella a solid infield. Katella scored seven runs on three home runs to 
beat <ORGANIZATION>Servite</ORGANIZATION> in the third-place game of the Loara tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody from our No. 1 to No. 9 batter is hitting the ball," said <PERSON>Tim 
McMenamin</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Katella</LOCATION>'s coach. Katella has a .375 team batting average in 
preseason play. 
</P>
<P>
Briggs is batting .647 with 11 hits in 17 at-bats in five games and newcomer 
<PERSON>Eric Boyd</PERSON> has been a pleasant surprise in the outfield, batting .562. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Danny Allen</PERSON>, formerly <PERSON>Danny Kirker</PERSON>, is the team's top pitcher. Allen allowed 
only two earned runs in <LOCATION>Katella</LOCATION>'s only loss to Ocean View. Catcher <PERSON>Jess Evans</PERSON> 
has made a successful transition from the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
4. SERVITE 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen returning varsity players, including seven starters, should help 
<ORGANIZATION>Servite</ORGANIZATION> turn around a mediocre <DATE>1989</DATE> season in which the Friars finished 
11-12-1. <PERSON>Cliff Mierendorf</PERSON> anchors a solid pitching staff. Shortstop <PERSON>Ed Crippin</PERSON> 
and first baseman <PERSON>Rob Walker</PERSON> are among the team's top hitters. 
</P>
<P>
Crippin batted .362 and had 11 stolen bases last season and <PERSON>Walker</PERSON>, the team's 
best power hitter, batted .464 with eight doubles. Catcher <PERSON>Ryan Boucher</PERSON> is one 
of the top defensive players in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We will produce runs with power and a good bench," said <PERSON>Mike McNary</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Servite</ORGANIZATION>'s 
coach. "We have high hopes for a turnaround season with every starter having at 
least one year of varsity experience. We could battle Mater Dei for the Angelus 
League championship." 
</P>
<P>
Servite will play at <ORGANIZATION>Mater Dei</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Saturday</DATE> in the league opener. 
</P>
<P>
5. TUSTIN 
</P>
<P>
The Tillers shared the <ORGANIZATION>Sea View League</ORGANIZATION> title with Estancia last year and 
advanced to the Southern Section 3-A semifinals. This should be another banner 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Two-year starter <PERSON>Dan Baker</PERSON>, who struck out 100 batters in 74 innings last year, 
has opened with victories over <LOCATION>Esperanza</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mission Viejo</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1990</DATE>. Two juniors 
-- outfielder <PERSON>Shawn Green</PERSON> and shortstop <PERSON>Ben Munoz</PERSON> -- are the Tillers' top 
hitters. Green is batting over .500 in six games. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin scored 54 runs in four games in the <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION> tournament and was held to 
less than 10 runs in only two games all <DATE>summer</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"We're swinging the bat pretty well," said <PERSON>Vince Brown</PERSON>, who has been head coach 
at <LOCATION>Tustin</LOCATION> for the past five seasons. "The team is batting over .350 and I have 
three players hitting over .450. I think we have the makings of the best team 
since I've been here." 
</P>
<P>
6. EDISON 
</P>
<P>
Consistently one of the county's top programs, <ORGANIZATION>Edison</ORGANIZATION> slumped to a 9-13-2 
record in <DATE>1989</DATE> after injuries to its top two pitchers. <PERSON>Jim Futami</PERSON> tore an arm 
muscle in <LOCATION>Edison</LOCATION>'s fifth league game but returns healthy. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher <PERSON>Steve Thobe</PERSON>, a 6-foot-5, 225-pound senior, has hit three home runs in 
six games and has a fine arm. Shortstop <PERSON>James Eidam</PERSON> and second baseman <PERSON>Rocky 
Balch</PERSON> return. 
</P>
<P>
Three stars on <ORGANIZATION>Edison</ORGANIZATION>'s football team -- <PERSON>Donnie Smith</PERSON>, <PERSON>Brian Higgins</PERSON> and <PERSON>Chad 
Ponegalek</PERSON> -- also will play key roles. Ponegalek is the team's leadoff hitter 
and has good speed. 
</P>
<P>
"We have good pitching, speed and contact hitters," said <PERSON>Paul Harrell</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Edison</ORGANIZATION> 
coach. "After last year, the key will be trying to keep our pitchers healthy." 
</P>
<P>
7. LOARA 
</P>
<P>
After losing eight of their first 11, <PERSON>Loara</PERSON> was the surprise winner of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Empire League</ORGANIZATION> last year. <PERSON>Joey Gaudio</PERSON> is the ace of a solid pitching staff and 
also plays the outfield. He won four games and batted .367 last year. Catcher 
<PERSON>Chris Hoffman</PERSON> is the team's best player, coming off a junior year in which he 
batted .333 and struck out only four times. 
</P>
<P>
"We have eight returners with valuable experience and four quality pitchers," 
said <PERSON>Rob Megill</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Loara</ORGANIZATION>'s coach. "As our pitching goes, we will go." 
</P>
<P>
8. LOS ALAMITOS 
</P>
<P>
All-county quarterback <PERSON>Todd Gragnano</PERSON> is equally impressive throwing a baseball, 
and along with outfielder <PERSON>Tony Napolitano</PERSON>, gives <LOCATION>Los Alamitos</LOCATION> a strong team. 
</P>
<P>
Gragnano won four games as a junior and batted .318. Another football standout, 
<PERSON>Brian Havens</PERSON>, returns after batting .370 with 19 RBIs as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Napolitano</PERSON> is one of the premier players in the county. Last season, he batted 
.427 with six home runs and 26 RBIs. "Hitting will be our strength," <LOCATION>Los 
Alamitos</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>Mike Gibson</PERSON> said. "We don't have much team speed and our 
pitching is a big question mark after Gragnano." 
</P>
<P>
9. EL TORO 
</P>
<P>
Four starters who combined to win 15 games give <ORGANIZATION>El Toro</ORGANIZATION> one of the best 
pitching staffs in the county. <PERSON>Rob Johnson</PERSON> won eight games; <PERSON>Brad Hulse</PERSON> won 
three games, and <PERSON>Greg Pearce</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ryan Filbeck</PERSON> each won two games last season. 
</P>
<P>
"Pitching should keep us in all games . . . hopefully the experience will pay 
off," <ORGANIZATION>El Toro</ORGANIZATION> Coach <PERSON>Dan DeLeon</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder <PERSON>Bo Haley</PERSON>, a three-year starter, is a Division I prospect and among 
the county's best players. Shortstop <PERSON>Chris Sauritch</PERSON> and third baseman <PERSON>Scott 
Sebbo</PERSON> both have good power. 
</P>
<P>
10. EL DORADO 
</P>
<P>
It is supposed to be a rebuilding for <ORGANIZATION>El Dorado</ORGANIZATION>, which won the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Section 
5-A</ORGANIZATION> division title last year. Every starter graduated from last year's team 
that finished 23-8, but Coach <PERSON>Steve Gullotti</PERSON> has a good group of sophomores and 
juniors who were the nucleus of the junior varsity team that finished 19-6 last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher <PERSON>Andy Brazeel</PERSON> has won four games going into <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s league opener with 
Esperanza. El Dorado had no problems scoring runs in the <LOCATION>Loara</LOCATION> tournament last 
week, getting 11 runs in the first inning in a 16-2 victory over <LOCATION>Savanna</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"We should be strong defensively and have more-than-adequate offense," <PERSON>Gullotti</PERSON> 
said. "We will need two or three pitchers to emerge if we expect to win." 
</P>
<P>
Others teams to watch: <LOCATION>Anaheim</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Capistrano Valley</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Esperanza</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Estancia</LOCATION>, 
<ORGANIZATION>Fountain Valley</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Mission Viejo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pacifica</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Sunny Hills</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Trabuco 
Hills</LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archaeologists searching <ORGANIZATION>Fort McHenry</ORGANIZATION> for
underground drainage conduits have stumbled upon a long trench
presumably used by infantrymen the <TIME>night</TIME> the British attacked
<LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> in <DATE>1814</DATE>.
   The bombardment of <LOCATION>Fort McHenry</LOCATION> inspired <PERSON>Francis Scott Key</PERSON> to
write the poem ``The Star-Spangled Banner,'' later adopted as the
national anthem.
   The trench, originally about three feet deep, is about seven feet
below today's surface level and is more than 100 feet long. It
contained a pewter infantryman's button the size of a nickel and a
10-pound fragment of a British cannon ball.
   ``At first, the trench was very puzzling. ... But it was the
(infantryman's) button and bomb fragment which linked it with the
War of <DATE>1812</DATE>. The button was of the type worn then, during the late
18th and early 19th centuries,'' said <PERSON>Charles D. Cheek</PERSON>, the
archaeologist in charge of the dig.
   The trench was dug around the fort's western flank, the side
farthest from the harbor and the British fleet. Historians believe
the 600 infantrymen stationed at <LOCATION>Fort McHenry</LOCATION> could have been
ordered into the trench as a safety measure.
   If the British had landed successfully in the attack on the <TIME>night</TIME>
of <DATE>Sept. 13, 1814</DATE>, the infantrymen would have been called upon to
defend the city.
   However, the British bombardment of the fort killed only four and
wounded about two dozen. The British were unable to get ashore and
retreated.
   The existence of some sort of old trench was known as early as
<DATE>1984</DATE>, when a section was discovered during an earlier dig. The
archaeologists doing the work then were unsure what the depression
was, <ORGANIZATION>Cheek</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Cheek and six other archaeologists arrived at the fort five weeks
ago under a <MONEY>$105,000</MONEY> contract from the <ORGANIZATION>National Park Service</ORGANIZATION> to find
the fort's original drainage conduits. They failed to find all the
drains.
   Park Ranger <PERSON>Paul E. Plamann</PERSON> said the archaeologists were called
in to see if there was an existing drainage system that could be
repaired and reopened because the fort has been troubled with
deterioration of its brickwork for many years.

FT  31 MAY 94 / European Elections: Experts likely to eclipse incoming
'stars' - It will not always be names best known to voters who hold real
levers of power in new assembly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
On <DATE>July 19</DATE>, when the new European Parliament elected on <DATE>June 9</DATE> and 12 holds
its inaugural session, <PERSON>Mr Franco Iacono</PERSON>, an Italian Socialist MEP not
standing for re-election, will have more than usual regrets. A tireless
campaigner in the outgoing legislature for mandatory bidets in European
hotels, he may face charges in <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION> on corruption allegations once his
parliamentary immunity expires.
The <ORGANIZATION>European Parliament</ORGANIZATION> hopes the elections will flush away its lesser
talents. It needs a new intake of calibre to project its influence and
exploit the new powers invested in it by the Maastricht treaty.
The new assembly will not lack grandees, but it will not always be the names
best known to voters who hold the real levers of power. And although voters
nationally have entrusted their governments to Socialists in only three of
the 12 <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> member states (<LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION>), everything indicates
that the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION>'s only directly elected body will be more Socialist-dominated
than ever before.
The leadership of the Socialist group, the largest at <LOCATION>Strasbourg</LOCATION>, is the
parliament's most influential position. It is expected to go to <PERSON>Mrs Pauline
Green</PERSON>, a tough-minded former policewoman who has commanded effectively the
British Labour contingent.
That <ORGANIZATION>UK Labour MEPs</ORGANIZATION>, already the largest single national unit and expected
to increase heavily at Tory expense, should aim single-mindedly at the group
leadership rather than the presidency accurately measures how power flows in
the <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>.
It is the leaders of the political groups - in which <ORGANIZATION>Mrs Green</ORGANIZATION> would be
prima inter pares - which set the agenda. Her counterpart in what looks set
to be a diminished Christian Democrat bloc is likely to remain <PERSON>Mr Leo
Tindemans</PERSON>, the former Belgian prime minister, set to be re-elected alongside
another former Belgian premier, <PERSON>Mr Wilfried Martens</PERSON>.
But the presidency of the parliament, hitherto a politically ill-defined
role trapped somewhere between parliamentary speaker and lacklustre
figurehead, could yet grow in stature. 'The potential for the presidency
becoming the job is growing,' believes <PERSON>Mr David Harley</PERSON> of the assembly's
secretariat-general.
Ms <PERSON>Elisabeth Guigou</PERSON>, former French minister for <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> standing in the
Socialist list, is a figure many insiders reckon has enough clout to give
the parliament an image of respect.
The Socialists also control environment - possibly the single most
influential committee in shaping law - under Labour MEP <PERSON>Mr Ken Collins</PERSON>, who
could face challenge from former <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> environment commissioner <ORGANIZATION>Carlo Ripa di
Meana</ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s Greens. They chair too the foreign affairs committee,
under <PERSON>Mr Enrique Baron</PERSON>, a lightweight former president of the parliament
whom some would like to see replaced by <PERSON>Mr Fernando Moran</PERSON>, a former Spanish
socialist foreign minister.
Formal structures aside, it is the preparation for the <DATE>1996</DATE> review of the
Maastricht treaty, in which parliament will have an important say, that will
define which MEPs rise. A key figure here will be the <ORGANIZATION>Scots Labour MEP</ORGANIZATION> and
parliament vice-president <PERSON>Mr David Martin</PERSON>, the Socialists' main
constitutional expert.
<PERSON>Mr Martin</PERSON> made a highly regarded submission to the Maastricht treaty
negotiations, and also chairs the 'conciliation' committee which operates
the parliament's new legislative powers in negotiation with the <ORGANIZATION>Council of
Ministers</ORGANIZATION>.
With these sorts of priorities, many incoming national 'stars' could well be
eclipsed. <PERSON>Mr Bernard Kouchner</PERSON>, flamboyant founder of Medecins sans
Frontieres and former minister for humanitarian affairs in the last French
socialist government, or <PERSON>Mr Jose-Maria Mendiluce</PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION>UNHCR</ORGANIZATION>
representative in <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION>, could fade in a body now concentrating more on
issues it can influence than on the human rights gestures it was famous for.
Nor is it clear what role other national figures, like former French
Socialist premier <PERSON>Michel Rocard</PERSON>, or <PERSON>Mr Achille Occhetto</PERSON>, leader of the
former Italian Communists, intend to play.
<PERSON>Mr Occhetto</PERSON>, already an MEP, appeared so seldom at <LOCATION>Strasbourg</LOCATION> that when he
turned up for <DATE>May</DATE>'s historic enlargement vote to admit four new countries
into the Union, he missed the first two votes on <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION> because
he did not know how to work his voting card.

days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:

   How's this for revisionist history? The
pilgrims sailed to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>Pinto</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Paul Revere</PERSON> wrote ``The
Star-Spangled Banner.'' <PERSON>Sandra Day O'Connor</PERSON> is chief justice of the
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>.
   And Gen. <PERSON>Douglas MacArthur</PERSON> said, ``Give me liberty or give me
death.'' Or was it <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr.</ORGANIZATION>?
   These are samplings of responses from community-college students
to questions that might be asked of immigrants seeking <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
citizenship.
   Just five of 119 students at <ORGANIZATION>Bellevue Community College</ORGANIZATION> managed
a passing grade of <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> or better.
   ``This is pretty bad,'' said <PERSON>Aslam Khan</PERSON>, head of the college's
political science department, who administered the test.
   ``Why should we give these questions to foreigners when our own
citizens don't know what is going on?'' asked the <PERSON>Pakistan-born
Khan</PERSON>, who took such a test when he became a naturalized citizen.
   Less than half the students knew that the supreme law of the
land is the Constitution.
   When asked what kind of government the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has, many
answered ``capitalist,'' rather than a democracy.
   Some said the pilgrims left <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> because they were searching
for something to colonize, apparently forgetting the religious
persecution that prompted them to flee to the <LOCATION>New World</LOCATION>.
   A decade ago, Khan gave a similar test of 10 questions to 118
students. Six passed.
   ``It's not getting any better,'' he said.
   It may be good for a few snickers when a student identifies
<PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON> as the principal author of the Declaration of
Independence, but when only one student answers 29 of the 30
questions correctly and just 18 get <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> right, everybody
should be concerned, <PERSON>Khan</PERSON> said.
   ``I think people should know what is going on in this country,''
he said. ``We really do need a course in remedial <ORGANIZATION>American
Government</ORGANIZATION>.''
   For the record:
   _ The Pinta, not the <PERSON>Pinto</PERSON>, was one of three ships used by
<PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON>, along with the <PERSON>Nina</PERSON> and the <LOCATION>Santa Maria</LOCATION>. The

   _ <PERSON>Francis Scott Key</PERSON> wrote the national anthem, while <PERSON>Paul Revere</PERSON>

   _ <PERSON>Ms. O'Connor</PERSON> is the first woman to serve on the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>,
which has yet to have a woman chief justice.
   _ <PERSON>Patrick Henry</PERSON> preferred death over tyranny in his famous to

FT  20 MAR 93 / Sport: Pride of Lions with an English accent - John Hopkins
saves the British and Irish selectors the trouble of picking a party to tour
New Zealand / Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMORROW morning, those selecting the British Lions' rugby squad to tour <LOCATION>New
Zealand</LOCATION> this <DATE>summer</DATE> will announce their choices. Gentlemen, you need not
bother. I have picked the party for you. Take the day off.
Although it is never easy to pick Lions' teams, I believe the <DATE>1993</DATE> party is
easier to select than, say, those of <DATE>1983</DATE> and <DATE>1989</DATE>. Players from <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> -
which is vying with <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> to be the second-best rugby nation in the
world - obviously should form the core of the party.
Some ground rules. First, I am selecting solely on ability. Lions' teams
have been dogged by regional parochialism. Imagine the scene: selectors
representing each of the four home unions gather round the table. As the
composition of the party takes shape, one selector realises that there will
only be a couple of players from his country. This will reflect badly on him
and colours his comments.
Since it is impossible for me to predict these outbursts of chauvinism, I
have ignored them altogether. How nice it would be to think there will be
none and that the best party is chosen.
The new laws have encouraged the up-and-under as an attacking tactic.
Full-backs who are safe under a high ball are essential. <PERSON>Gavin Hastings</PERSON> is
one and so, generally, is <PERSON>Jonathan Webb</PERSON>. And while neither is entirely
reliable with the boot (look at <ORGANIZATION>Webb</ORGANIZATION> against <LOCATION>Wasps</LOCATION> <DATE>last Saturday</DATE>), there
will be other goal-kickers in the party.
Wings? The <PERSON>Underwood</PERSON> brothers are scorching attackers and deadly finishers.
<PERSON>Ieuan Evans</PERSON>, provided his shoulder is all right, would be a good
vice-captain. He has led Wales well since he was appointed captain 18 months
ago. The fourth wing is a toss-up between <PERSON>Ian Hunter</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Northampton</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Simon Geoghegan</PERSON>. Geoghegan is the better wing, <PERSON>Hunter</PERSON> the more
rounded player who can play full-back as well. Since versatility is an asset
on tour, I prefer <PERSON>Hunter</PERSON>.
Will Carling and <PERSON>Jeremy Guscott</PERSON> are unchallenged as the first-choice
partnership in the centre. <PERSON>Scott Gibbs</PERSON>, the sturdy young Welshman, should
go. He is a rock-solid tackler, as is <PERSON>Scott Hastings</PERSON>. I give my nod to
<PERSON>Hastings</PERSON>, though not by much over the Bath club's promising <PERSON>Phil de
Glanville</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Stuart Barnes</PERSON> and <PERSON>Rob Andrew</PERSON> are as clear a choice as stand-off halves as
<ORGANIZATION>Carling</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Guscott</PERSON> outside them. They complement one another. <PERSON>Barnes</PERSON> has an
edge on a firm pitch because of the way he can get his line moving. He
demonstrated this brilliantly at <LOCATION>Twickenham</LOCATION> against <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>. Andrew is a
doughty competitor and a good goal-kicker. The competition between them will
be keen.
<PERSON>Gary Armstrong</PERSON> is the obvious first choice at scrum-half. Will the other be
<PERSON>Dewi Morris</PERSON>, whose tendency to play as a ninth forward can be so useful, or
<PERSON>Robert Jones</PERSON>, the quick-passing technician? Jones could have lost his chance
by operating behind a beaten pack for most of the season. Morris is my
choice.
No. 8? A man like <PERSON>Dean Richards</PERSON> is an essential component of a team in <LOCATION>New
Zealand</LOCATION> where at least some of the games will be played in mud. His
upper-body strength and ability to tie-up the ball will be invaluable. With
training every day, he should get a bit fitter, too.
If, however, the ground is dry and the game is expected to be fast and
loose, then <PERSON>Ben Clarke</PERSON> would be an acceptable choice at No. 8. He could even
play blindside flanker with <PERSON>Richards</PERSON> at the back.
Is <PERSON>Wade Dooley</PERSON> a spent force? I think not. If there are four better line-out
forwards in the home countries, then I am a Dutchman. He will benefit from
regular competition, which he does not get with <PERSON>Preston Grasshoppers</PERSON>.
<ORGANIZATION>Martin Bayfield</ORGANIZATION> should go along with <PERSON>Martin Johnson</PERSON>, who is known and
respected in <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>. Candidates for the fourth place as a lock include
<PERSON>Gareth Llewellyn</PERSON>, who has blossomed this season as captain of <LOCATION>Neath</LOCATION>; <PERSON>Neil
Francis</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>; and the <LOCATION>Scots</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Doddie Weir</PERSON> and <PERSON>Damian Cronin</PERSON>. Francis is
my man.
<PERSON>Kenny Milne</PERSON> and <PERSON>Brian Moore</PERSON> are certainties as the hookers, <PERSON>Jeff Probyn</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Jason Leonard</PERSON> as two of the props. I think that <PERSON>Nick Popplewell</PERSON>, the fiery
Irishman, and <PERSON>Paul Burnell</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>, should join them.
Flankers? <PERSON>Peter Winterbottom</PERSON> picks himself because he is one of the best in
the world. I think <PERSON>Neil Back</PERSON> deserves a chance to demonstrate his phenomenal
workrate on the open-side. <PERSON>Mike Teague</PERSON> is another <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> style forward,
a man who blossomed on tour in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> four years ago and could do so
again this <DATE>summer</DATE>. <PERSON>Emyr Lewis</PERSON> was a leading candidate four months ago but
has not played at his best this season. <PERSON>Tim Rodber</PERSON> has come on at
<LOCATION>Northampton</LOCATION> under the aegis of <PERSON>Wayne Shelford</PERSON> and, like <PERSON>Clarke</PERSON>, could play
either at No 8 or flanker. He deserves a chance.
Now, having picked the team one must address the ticklish question of the
captaincy. It is true that <PERSON>Carling</PERSON> is the most successful captain in world
rugby. But that does not take in to account that he does not seem entirely
at ease with it and, more to the point, what goes with it  - the media and
all that. Hastings manages to do both with less apparent discomfort.
It might be a horrible mistake or it might be a moment of inspired thinking
to make <PERSON>Hastings</PERSON> the captain and give Carling a break from captaincy to
concentrate entirely on his own game. I plump for <PERSON>Hastings</PERSON>.
So there you are Lions' selectors, I have done the job for you in half the
time and at no cost. The party comprises 21 Englishmen, five Scots, two
Welshmen and two Irishmen. I must now duck my Irish and Welsh friends and
colleagues for having picked only two men from their country but I did say I
would select strictly on merit.
Thus the composition of my party is (English unless otherwise stated): G
<PERSON>Hastings</PERSON>, (<LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>) capt, J <PERSON>Webb</PERSON>, R <PERSON>Underwood</PERSON>, T <PERSON>Underwood</PERSON>, I <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>,
(<LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION>), I <PERSON>Hunter</PERSON>, W <LOCATION>Carling</LOCATION>, J <PERSON>Guscott</PERSON>, S <PERSON>Gibbs</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION>), S <PERSON>Hastings</PERSON>,
(<LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>) S <PERSON>Barnes</PERSON>, R <PERSON>Andrew</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>G Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>), D <PERSON>Morris</PERSON>, J <PERSON>Probyn</PERSON>, J
Leonard, N <PERSON>Popplewell</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>), P <PERSON>Burnell</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>), B <PERSON>Moore</PERSON>, K <PERSON>Milne</PERSON>
(<LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>), W <PERSON>Dooley</PERSON>, M <ORGANIZATION>Bayfield</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>M Johnson</PERSON>, N <PERSON>Francis</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>), P
<PERSON>Winterbottom</PERSON>, N Back, M <PERSON>Teague</PERSON>, T <PERSON>Rodber</PERSON>, B <PERSON>Clarke</PERSON>, D <PERSON>Richards</PERSON>.

<LEADPARA>  American League starting pitcher Jack Morris of the Minnesota Twins was hit on
the outside of his right foot by a Bobby Bonilla liner, and left after two
innings. Morris was examined by a Blue Jays doctor and taken to nearby Mount
Sinai Hospital, where X-rays of his bruised foot were reported to be
negative.;    After Morris returned to the park he was asked why he kept
playing after the injury. "You only get to play in an All-Star Game a few
times," he said. "And it was my foot that hurt and not my arm."  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  All-Star Game
Notebook  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The loss of <PERSON>Morris</PERSON> (11-6) to injury would have left <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> at least
temporarily without its top two pitchers. <PERSON>Scott Erickson</PERSON> (12-3) was placed on
the 15-day disabled list <DATE>July 2.</DATE>;  <PERSON>CLARK</PERSON> SWINGS TOWARD CAUTION, PASSES UP THE
HOME-RUN DERBY; <PERSON>Will Clark</PERSON> homered on the last two days before the All-Star
break and stood among the <ORGANIZATION>National League</ORGANIZATION> leaders with 15. So why wasn't the
<ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>' first baseman in <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s home-run derby?;    "They asked me to be in
it, and I said no," <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> said. "It was the first time in the four years I've
been here that they asked <LOCATION>me.</LOCATION>;    "My swing is finally coming around right
now, and I wanted to stay in a groove.";    Twice this season, <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> has been
injured in rundown plays and forced to take time off. It runs in the family.
<PERSON>Clark</PERSON> said this was his first opportunity to visit his brother, <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>, since
the boy broke an arm playing in a baseball game last month in <LOCATION>Louisiana.</LOCATION>;   
"Scotty had a rundown, he had a trip and a fall, and then everybody and their
grandma fell on top of him," <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> said.;    "I broke my left wrist when I was
13. I missed a whole year of <LOCATION>Babe Ruth</LOCATION> because of it.";  <ORGANIZATION>Franco</ORGANIZATION> says he was
misquoted; The All-Star Game's raging controversy turned into a lovefest
Tuesday.;    As it turns out, <PERSON>Julio Franco</PERSON> did not insist he was better
qualified to start at second base than <PERSON>Roberto Alomar</PERSON>, a remark that had
stirred a hornets' nest in <LOCATION>Toronto.</LOCATION>;    <LOCATION>Franco</LOCATION>, in a private meeting before
they dressed for the game, claimed he was misquoted. And <PERSON>Alomar</PERSON> believed him.;
   "Somebody asked me a question," <PERSON>Franco</PERSON> said. "He twisted my words. I said,
'If you can prove I shouldn't start, I'll kiss my own (backside). I didn't say
anything about <PERSON>Roberto Alomar</PERSON>.";    Said <PERSON>Alomar</PERSON>: "We're both Latin. We're too
good of friends to let this stand between us. I wasn't mad at Julio. I just
had to see him in person and talk about it first. We Latins have to stick
together.";    <ORGANIZATION>Franco</ORGANIZATION> is from the <LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Alomar</PERSON> from <LOCATION>Puerto
Rico.</LOCATION>;  Edge to pitchers,; <PERSON>Sandberg</PERSON> says; There had been only 31 runs scored
in the last seven All-Star Games before <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, dating to the <DATE>1984</DATE> game at
<LOCATION>Candlestick Park</LOCATION>. N.L. second baseman <PERSON>Ryne Sandberg</PERSON> played in all of them, and
he gave this theory:;    "In all the games I've been involved in, the pitchers
have dominated. They're giving it all they've got, because they're only going
an inning or two. I'd say the average fastball is about 5 mph faster than
usual.";  <PERSON>Rickey</PERSON> plays coy;  There were about 700 reporters at the game, and
there seemed to be nearly that many who were stiffed by A's outfielder <PERSON>Rickey
Henderson</PERSON>. The All-Star regular usually talks at these things, but he
continues to be taciturn this season.;  Big difference;  The weather was not
the only difference between this game and the last one -- at rainy <LOCATION>Wrigley
Field</LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>N.L.</ORGANIZATION> had three hits in the first inning, one more than they had in
the entire <DATE>1990</DATE> game.;  La Russa knows; fame is fleeting; The A's <PERSON>Tony La
Russa</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>A.L.</ORGANIZATION> manager, said he has kept track of the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>' woes and said
he has sympathy for Bay Area counterpart <PERSON>Roger Craig.</PERSON>;    "He's a dedicated
winner," <ORGANIZATION>La Russa</ORGANIZATION> said. "When he's not doing as good as he'd like to do, he
suffers. I know he's suffered more than any fan has.;    "That's why you
appreciate it any time you have success. It can go away quickly. It also can
appear quickly, maybe even in the second half for him and the Giants."; 
Astros stand out; Why was the <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> contingent wearing white uniforms as
visitors? Don't blame pitcher <PERSON>Pete Harnisch</PERSON>, catcher <PERSON>Craig Biggio</PERSON> or Manager
<PERSON>Art Howe</PERSON>, who was an <ORGANIZATION>N.L.</ORGANIZATION> coach. It seems the Astros' road uniforms are
off-white, and they stood out during introductions.;  DRY SPELL ENDS; <PERSON>Andre
Dawson</PERSON>'s fourth-inning homer off <PERSON>Roger Clemens</PERSON> was the first by an <ORGANIZATION>N.L.</ORGANIZATION> player
since <PERSON>Dale Murphy</PERSON> hit one in the <DATE>1984</DATE> game at <LOCATION>Candlestick Park</LOCATION>. That had been
61 innings and 223 All-Star at-bats ago.;  AN AGING RECORD; With his bloop
single to center in the sixth inning, <LOCATION>A.L.</LOCATION> catcher <PERSON>Carlton Fisk</PERSON> became the
oldest player to hit safely in an All-Star Game. <PERSON>Ted Williams</PERSON> had been the
oldest, at 41, in <DATE>1960</DATE>. Fisk is 43.;  MISCELLANY; Strangest sight of the
night: A sellout <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> crowd cheering when <PERSON>Dennis Eckersley</PERSON> struck out
<PERSON>George Bell</PERSON> in the ninth. Bell left the <LOCATION>SkyDome</LOCATION> an unpopular man <DATE>last winter</DATE>.
Despite the <ORGANIZATION>Blue Jays</ORGANIZATION>' rivalry with the A's, <PERSON>Eckersley</PERSON> was carrying the <ORGANIZATION>A.L.</ORGANIZATION>'s
hopes. . . . Happy 37th birthday to Cubs outfielder <PERSON>Andre Dawson</PERSON>. . . .
Upcoming All-Star sites: <PERSON>Jack Murphy</PERSON> Stadium in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> (<DATE>1992</DATE>), Camden Yards
in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> (<DATE>1993</DATE>) and <ORGANIZATION>Three Rivers Stadium</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> (<DATE>1994</DATE>). This was
the first All-Star Game in <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> and the second in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. Montreal was the
site in <DATE>1982</DATE>. . . . <ORGANIZATION>N.L.</ORGANIZATION> Manager <PERSON>Lou Piniella</PERSON> became the 20th person to play
and then manage in an All-Star Game. The last to do so was <PERSON>Davey Johnson</PERSON>, who
managed the <ORGANIZATION>N.L.</ORGANIZATION> in the <DATE>1987</DATE> game. . . . <PERSON>Tom Glavine</PERSON> was the first left-handed
pitcher to start the game for the <ORGANIZATION>N.L.</ORGANIZATION> since <PERSON>Fernando Valenzuela</PERSON> in <DATE>1981</DATE>, and
the first Braves pitcher to start since <PERSON>Warren Spahn</PERSON> (<DATE>1949</DATE>, <DATE>1958</DATE> and the first
game in <DATE>1961</DATE>).  </TEXT>

   Q: Where are you if you see a bowl of M&amp;Ms and
find that someone has removed all the brown ones?
   A: Chances are, you're backstage at a concert by <PERSON>Van Halen</PERSON>;
members of the rock band specifically demand that all brown M&amp;Ms be
deleted.
   That's according to <PERSON>Leonard</PERSON> ``Cy'' <PERSON>Kocis</PERSON>, 41, the <LOCATION>Mahwah</LOCATION>,
N.J.-based caterer who services rockers and other entertainers on
the road. Sometimes, he said recently, his clients make peculiar
demands.
   For example:
   The rock group Rush wants <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola</ORGANIZATION>, but only in the
old-fashioned glass bottles. U2 wants shepherd's pie and Dom
Perignon champagne. Tiffany has a hankering for Evian water and ``a
variety of kosher meats.'' <LOCATION>Bon Jovi</LOCATION> requires Jolt cola, the
caffeine-laden drink. <PERSON>Frank Sinatra</PERSON>, by contrast, wanted only
<ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION>'s chicken and rice soup _ in a can.

PREP NOTES / ROB FERNAS: INJURED LEUZINGER ACE WILL TRY TO PITCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rob Fernas 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leuzinger pitcher <PERSON>Tyrone Scott</PERSON>, considered one of the <LOCATION>South Bay</LOCATION>'s top major 
league baseball prospects and the key to the Olympians' hopes for a <ORGANIZATION>Bay League</ORGANIZATION> 
title, has a sore arm. 
</P>
<P>
Coach <PERSON>Derrel Thomas</PERSON> said <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>'s injury, which he described as "tenderness of 
the elbow," may prevent the left-hander from pitching indefinitely. Scott has 
not pitched since <DATE>April 11</DATE> when he first complained of soreness in a poor 
outing against <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Scott missed his scheduled start <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> in <DATE>Leuzinger</DATE>'s 6-3 <LOCATION>Bay League</LOCATION> loss to 
<PERSON>Palos Verdes</PERSON> but will try to pitch in today's rematch with the <ORGANIZATION>Sea Kings</ORGANIZATION> at 
<ORGANIZATION>Palos Verdes</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to warm up," <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said. "If his elbow is still tender, I won't 
let him pitch. Then we'll take it from there. If it's that bad, he has to go to 
the doctor and get it checked out. 
</P>
<P>
"Tyrone wants to play major league baseball someday, and I feel he has a chance 
to do that. I don't want anything to happen that could endanger his future." 
</P>
<P>
The erratic <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>, who has continued to play center field and bat third, is 4-2 
with a 1.59 ERA and leads the <LOCATION>South Bay</LOCATION> with 72 strikeouts and 54 walks in 44 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger was regarded as a contender for the <ORGANIZATION>Bay League</ORGANIZATION> title before the 
season but is struggling in a fifth-place tie at 3-4. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside forward <PERSON>Eddie Scott</PERSON>, whose cousin <PERSON>Byron</PERSON> played basketball at 
<ORGANIZATION>Arizona State</ORGANIZATION> before finding fame and fortune with the <ORGANIZATION>Lakers</ORGANIZATION>, also will play 
collegiately in the Grand Canyon state. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-7 <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> signed a letter of intent with <ORGANIZATION>Northern Arizona</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, the 
<DATE>day before his 19th birthday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people want to go to a big-name college with big-time players, but they 
don't get any playing time," <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> said. "<LOCATION>Northern Arizona</LOCATION> is giving me a 
chance to come in and start." 
</P>
<P>
Although it is considered a small college in basketball circles, <LOCATION>Northern 
Arizona</LOCATION> competes on the Division I level. The school's recruiting efforts in 
the <LOCATION>South Bay</LOCATION> also netted <ORGANIZATION>Harbor College</ORGANIZATION> guard <PERSON>Keith Billingslea</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Scott needs to score 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test to be eligible as a 
freshman, but he said <ORGANIZATION>Northern Arizona</ORGANIZATION> will accept him even if he has to sit 
out next year. He has two more chances to take the SAT. 
</P>
<P>
Scott averaged a team-high 14.7 points a game and led Morningside (25-6) to the 
<ORGANIZATION>Ocean League</ORGANIZATION> championship, the semifinals of Southern Section 3-A playoffs and 
the finals of the <ORGANIZATION>Southern California Division III</ORGANIZATION> regionals. He was named 
<ORGANIZATION>Ocean League MVP</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Cal State Dominguez Hills</ORGANIZATION> made it two-for-two in recruiting <PERSON>Carson High</PERSON>'s top 
basketball players by signing 6-5 forward <PERSON>Vincent Washington</PERSON> to a letter of 
intent. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the Toros landed <ORGANIZATION>Carson</ORGANIZATION> guard <PERSON>Ray Bennett</PERSON>. <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Bennett</PERSON> 
were members of <ORGANIZATION>The Times South Bay All-Star Team</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very excited about each of our signees," said <PERSON>Dominguez Hills Coach 
Dave Yanai</PERSON>, who also signed 6-7 center <PERSON>Cesar Uballe</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Bell</ORGANIZATION> and 6-5 forward 
<PERSON>Norm Francis</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION>. "They are well-rounded players who will contribute 
immediately while making an impact in our program over the next four years." 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> averaged 17 points and 8.3 rebounds to help <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> win the <LOCATION>Pacific 
League</LOCATION> title and reach the semifinals of the <LOCATION>L.A. City</LOCATION> 4-A playoffs. He was 
named the <ORGANIZATION>Pacific League MVP</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Mira Costa</PERSON> took a commanding two-game lead in the <ORGANIZATION>Ocean League</ORGANIZATION> volleyball race 
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> with a 15-5, 15-8, 15-4 victory over visiting <LOCATION>North Torrance</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs, ranked No. 1 in the Southern Section 4-A Division, improved to 
11-0 overall and 9-0 in league behind the play of middle blocker <PERSON>Pat Ivie</PERSON>. 
Second-place North fell to 7-2 in the league. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Mira Costa</PERSON> will venture north for a pair of non-league matches against 
10th-ranked <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Dos Pueblos</LOCATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> and <DATE>Saturday</DATE> nights. 
</P>
<P>
Coach <PERSON>Mike Cook</PERSON>'s Mustangs are gearing up for the competitive <ORGANIZATION>Redondo 
Tournament</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>April 29</DATE>. The 25-team field includes Corona del Mar, ranked 
fourth in 4-A; University of <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION>, ranked sixth; <LOCATION>Palisades</LOCATION>, defending <LOCATION>L.A. 
City</LOCATION> 4-A champion, and three of the top-ranked teams in the Southern Section 
3-A Division: <ORGANIZATION>Harvard of North Hollywood</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Arcadia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Long Beach Wilson</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
North <PERSON>Torrance</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>West Torrance</ORGANIZATION> will play an alumni football game, the 
schools' third in the last five years, at <TIME>7 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>May 20</DATE> at <LOCATION>North</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
North alumni interested in playing are asked to meet <DATE>April 27</DATE> at the school 
football stadium or call the school at 533-4416. The team will be coached by 
<PERSON>Kelsey Baughfman</PERSON>, a former North player and an assistant coach for the Saxons.

<HEAD>Gordon Jackson, Star of `Upstairs, Downstairs,' Dead at 66</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto NY24</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor <PERSON>Gordon Jackson</PERSON>, who played the butler in
``Upstairs, Downstairs'' and brought his mellifluous Scots accent
to dozens of films, stage and television roles, has died, his agent
said <DATE>today</DATE>. He was 66.
   Jackson died <DATE>Sunday</DATE> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Cromwell Hospital</ORGANIZATION> with his wife,
<PERSON>Rona</PERSON>, at his side, <PERSON>Michael Anderson</PERSON> said. The cause of death was
not disclosed, but <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> said <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> had been ill for a short
time.
   The tall, ginger-haired <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> started acting as a teen-ager
soon after the outbreak of World War II. His rueful expression
first typecast him as a coward and a weakling, although maturity
brought him a greater variety of roles.
   His acting career spanned nearly half a century and included
more than 60 film credits, but he was best known for his role as
the stiff-upper-lipped butler Hudson in the internationally
successful television series ``Upstairs, Downstairs'' from <DATE>1970</DATE> to
<DATE>1975</DATE>.
   He won a British Actor of the Year award in <DATE>1974</DATE> for the series,
reruns of which are still being shown in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   Jackson, described as gentle and self-effacing by friends, once
said: ``My trouble is that I'm underconfident and I'm too
tentative. I'm not a go-getter and I never have been.
   ``It's only when the curtain goes up and the cameras start to
roll that I don't enjoy this business.''
   <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> was born in <LOCATION>Glasgow</LOCATION> in <DATE>1923</DATE>. He started an
apprenticeship with <ORGANIZATION>Rolls Royce</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Edinburgh</LOCATION>, but got his first
professional acting job as in <DATE>1941</DATE>, playing a Scottish soldier in
the film ``The Foreman Went to <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>,'' a story of Britons trapped
in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in <DATE>1940</DATE> by the German invasion.
   His film credits included ``Whisky Galore'' in <DATE>1948</DATE>, ``Mutiny on
the Bounty'' in <DATE>1961</DATE>, `The Great Escape'' in <DATE>1962</DATE>, ``The Prime of
Miss Jean Brodie'' in <DATE>1968</DATE> and ``The Whistle Blower'' in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   He also played the tough undercover police chief <PERSON>Cowley</PERSON> in the
British TV thriller series ``The Professionals'' from <DATE>1977</DATE> to <DATE>1981</DATE>,
and was in the <DATE>1988</DATE> TV movie ``Noble House.''
   On stage, he was <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION>'s Banquo in ``Macbeth,'' Horatio in
``Hamlet,'' Mavolio in ``Twelfth Night'' and a host of other
characters in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>West End</LOCATION>.
   ``Upstairs, Downstairs'' co-star <PERSON>John Alderton</PERSON> recalled <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>
as ``the sweetest, gentlest man I have ever met. To have worked
with him was a privilege, to be counted as a friend was an honor.
His unparalleled contribution to film and television for over 50
years will remain a testament to his very special talent.''
   Jackson is survived by his wife, <PERSON>Rona</PERSON>, also an actress, and two
sons. Funeral plans have not been made.

CITY BASKETBALL PREVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
L.A. POWERS CRENSHAW, MANUAL ARTS AGAIN HAVE STATE INTENTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since <DATE>March</DATE>, when Manual Arts, the <LOCATION>City</LOCATION>'s top-ranked and last surviving 
postseason basketball team, was ousted from the state playoffs, anticipation 
started to build for this season. 
</P>
<P>
With several City programs on the rise, at least four teams are considered 
among the state's best. City teams have won five of the nine modern <ORGANIZATION>State 
Division</ORGANIZATION> I titles: <PERSON>Crenshaw</PERSON> four of them and Manual Arts one. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, <ORGANIZATION>Manual Arts</ORGANIZATION> won its first City 4-A title since <DATE>1981</DATE> by defeating 
<PERSON>Crenshaw</PERSON>, 84-72. But in the state playoffs, <LOCATION>City</LOCATION> teams were slighted. Manual 
Arts was seeded only third and <PERSON>Crenshaw</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION>, which was runner-up in the 
3-A Division with a 29-3 record, were passed over. 
</P>
<P>
This season, quality teams and players can be found throughout the City 
Section. 
</P>
<P>
A look at The Times' preseason top 10 City Section basketball teams: 
</P>
<P>
1. MANUAL ARTS 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Western League</ORGANIZATION> (4-A Division) 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 27-4 
</P>
<P>
Third-year Coach <PERSON>Randolph Simpson</PERSON> has a solid team that is expected to repeat 
as City 4-A champion. <PERSON>Marcell Capers</PERSON> and All-City center <PERSON>William Celestine</PERSON> are 
gone, but the Toilers are still loaded with high-flying <PERSON>Kevin Beal</PERSON>, a 6-foot-5 
forward, and <PERSON>Dwain Bradberry</PERSON>, a returning starter at guard. 
</P>
<P>
Manual Arts will start three forwards and two guards because it does not have a 
true center. The Toilers' strength will be balance: every Manual Arts starter 
is taller than 6-3. <PERSON>Roland Merriwether</PERSON> (6-3), <PERSON>Bryan Smith</PERSON> (6-4) and <PERSON>Wilbert 
Knight</PERSON> (6-3) are the other starters. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the real big man," <PERSON>Simpson</PERSON> said. "But, we have guys who all can 
handle the ball well, shoot well, and everyone plays above the rim." 
</P>
<P>
2. CRENSHAW 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Southern League</ORGANIZATION> (4-A Division) 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 22-5 
</P>
<P>
Last season was supposed to be an off year for the Cougars, but Coach <PERSON>Willie 
West</PERSON> simply led <PERSON>Crenshaw</PERSON> to the 4-A final and finished with a 22-5 record. The 
Cougars have the two players who led them last season -- guards <PERSON>Kevin Ollie</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Alexious Scruggs</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Ollie, a 6-2 senior, led <ORGANIZATION>Crenshaw</ORGANIZATION> in scoring last season and is joined in the 
backcourt by <PERSON>Scruggs</PERSON>, a 6-2 junior, who loves to shoot. Last season, <PERSON>Crenshaw</PERSON> 
did not have its usual depth but look for it this season as West goes for his 
12th City title. 
</P>
<P>
3. FREMONT 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Central League</ORGANIZATION> (3-A Division) 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 28-3 
</P>
<P>
There are many who think that Coach <PERSON>Sam Sullivan</PERSON> has the best team in the <LOCATION>City</LOCATION>, 
despite being in the 3-A Division, and they may be right. Last season, the 
Pathfinders blasted into the 3-A final with a chance to win 30 games but were 
upset by <LOCATION>North Hollywood</LOCATION>. This season, <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION> may be even better. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Chris Ford</PERSON>, a 6-2 scoring swingman, and <PERSON>Michael Tate</PERSON>, a 6-7 inside force, lead 
the way for the Pathfinders, who won the 3-A title two seasons ago. Point guard 
<PERSON>Robert Moore</PERSON> controls <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION>'s offense but a full-court pressure defense will 
again be the key for the Pathfinders. 
</P>
<P>
4. FAIRFAX 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Western League</ORGANIZATION> (4-A Division) 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 22-6 
</P>
<P>
Coach <PERSON>Harvey Kitani</PERSON> may have the sleeper team of the season, led by 6-5 <PERSON>Ryan 
Hickman</PERSON> and scoring guard <PERSON>Burt Harris</PERSON>. Last season <PERSON>Hickman</PERSON> averaged 18.5 points 
and 12.5 rebounds a game, and <PERSON>Harris</PERSON> has been the leading scorer for the Lions 
so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
5. CARSON 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Pacific League</ORGANIZATION> (4-A Division) 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 19-9 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Carson</PERSON> is best known as a football power, but this season, Coach <PERSON>Richard Masson</PERSON> 
has a basketball team that could duplicate its counterpart's success. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the way for the <ORGANIZATION>Colts</ORGANIZATION> is Rudy <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, a 6-4 junior forward. The key 
for the Colts, though, could be the return of <PERSON>Khary Stanley</PERSON>, a 6-9 junior 
center, who has been out with a back injury. Look for <ORGANIZATION>Carson</ORGANIZATION> to be a force late 
in the season when it can feature a deep lineup with <ORGANIZATION>Stanley</ORGANIZATION> and several 
football players , who will return to action. 
</P>
<P>
6. WESTCHESTER 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Western League</ORGANIZATION> (4-A Division) 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 16-11 
</P>
<P>
The Comets have only one starting senior, but he is <PERSON>LeRoi O'Brien</PERSON>, a 6-8 
center. O'Brien averaged double figures in both scoring and rebounding last 
season. Coach <PERSON>Ed Azzam</PERSON> will look for leadership from <PERSON>O'Brien</PERSON>, but juniors <PERSON>James 
Gray</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Lorenzo Ball</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Marty Cotwright</PERSON> will have to contribute as well. 
</P>
<P>
7. RESEDA <ORGANIZATION>CLEVELAND 
</P>
<P>
North Valley League</ORGANIZATION> (4-A Division) 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 21-5 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Cavaliers</ORGANIZATION> had <PERSON>Crenshaw</PERSON> on the ropes in the 4-A semifinals last season 
before losing in overtime, 91-90. <PERSON>Kevin Crider</PERSON>, who previously coached at <ORGANIZATION>Los 
Angeles High</ORGANIZATION>, is now the coach at <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> and has an experienced starting 
five. <PERSON>Kayheed Murray</PERSON>, a 6-5 senior, and <PERSON>Brandon Martin</PERSON>, a 6-4 junior, give the 
Cavaliers a solid forward combination. Cleveland will need time to adjust to 
<PERSON>Cryder</PERSON>, who is the team's fourth coach in a little more than a year, but should 
be a contender for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
8. <LOCATION>WASHINGTON</LOCATION>

LAKERS PROVE THEY HAVE PLENTY IN RESERVES; 
</P>
<P>
BENCH REPELS SUNS, 127-119, IN GAME ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During training camp in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> <DATE>last fall</DATE>, Laker Coach <PERSON>Pat Riley</PERSON> boldly 
predicted that his promising corps of reserves would prove to be the deepest, 
most productive in his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
Little that happened during the regular season supported <PERSON>Riley</PERSON>'s prediction. 
But in Game 1 of the <ORGANIZATION>NBA Western Conference</ORGANIZATION> finals <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, when it was needed 
the most, his bench helped lift the Lakers to a 127-119 victory over the 
<ORGANIZATION>Phoenix Suns</ORGANIZATION> before a Forum crowd of 17,505. 
</P>
<P>
Thrust into lead roles by necessity, the supporting players had to perform if 
the Lakers were to overcome the <ORGANIZATION>Suns</ORGANIZATION>, who overcame a 16-point first-half 
deficit in the opening game of this seven-game series. 
</P>
<P>
Magic <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> was on the bench with five fouls, eventually fouling out late in 
the game. <PERSON>Byron Scott</PERSON>, also in foul trouble, spent much of the second half 
sitting next to <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
And <PERSON>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</PERSON> sat out the final five minutes because of an injured 
hip. 
</P>
<P>
In came <PERSON>Orlando Woolridge</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mychal Thompson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michael Cooper</PERSON> to rescue their 
more famous teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"When your key guys are out," <PERSON>Woolridge</PERSON> said, "everybody out on the court has 
got to do something extra. You have to." 
</P>
<P>
So, even though <PERSON>James Worthy</PERSON> scored 32 points and stifled counterpart <PERSON>Tom 
Chambers</PERSON>, nearly everyone concerned credited the Laker bench for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the difference today," <PERSON>Riley</PERSON> said of his reserves. 
</P>
<P>
"(<PERSON>Woolridge</PERSON>) was outstanding. He paid his rent today. Coop ran the offense very 
well. We know it's going to take eight men to beat these guys." 
</P>
<P>
Not eight at once, of course. But against a team with so many offensive 
resources, led by multi-talented point guard <PERSON>Kevin Johnson</PERSON>, Laker depth was 
essential merely to keep pace. <PERSON>Woolridge</PERSON> scored 11 of his 13 points in the 
second half and added seven rebounds, three assists, two blocked shots and a 
key steal late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper ably ran the Laker offense in <ORGANIZATION>Magic Johnson</ORGANIZATION>'s absence and took over 
<LOCATION>Scott</LOCATION>'s unenviable task of guarding <PERSON>Kevin Johnson</PERSON>, who had 27 points and 18 
assists in 46 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
And <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON>, who had eight points and six rebounds in relief of Abdul-Jabbar, 
combined with <PERSON>Woolridge</PERSON> for what might have been the game-clinching play. 
</P>
<P>
With two minutes left and <PERSON>Magic Johnson</PERSON> having fouled out, the <ORGANIZATION>Lakers</ORGANIZATION> held a 
116-111 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Suns</ORGANIZATION> threw a half-court trap at the <LOCATION>Lakers</LOCATION>, and the best shot they could 
get was a baseline jump shot by <PERSON>Woolridge</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
He missed, but <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> grabbed the rebound. He then fed <PERSON>Woolridge</PERSON> charging 
through the lane for a dunk shot while being fouled by <PERSON>Tyrone Corbin</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Woolridge's free throw gave the Lakers an eight-point lead with 1:35 left, and 
they were not threatened thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Woolridge</PERSON> made the big plays," <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> forward <PERSON>Eddie Johnson</PERSON> said. "<PERSON>Mychal</PERSON> got 
that offensive rebound that killed us, and then <PERSON>Woolridge</PERSON> got that big 
three-point play. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't take advantage (of the Laker reserves). If we had someone come up 
and say to us before the game, 'What would you like (to happen), we definitely 
would've took (having Magic and Scott in foul trouble). But we just didn't do 
what we had to do to win in the <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE>." 
</P>
<P>
And the Lakers did. 
</P>
<P>
Despite <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> fouling out for the first time in the playoffs since <DATE>1981</DATE>, and 
despite having <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> on the bench for an 11-minute stretch in the <DATE>second half</DATE>, 
the Lakers persevered and remained unbeaten in eight playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
Dating to last season, the Lakers have won 10 straight playoff games, an <ORGANIZATION>NBA</ORGANIZATION> 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy continued his prolific playoff scoring, making 13 of 22 shots. He also 
held <ORGANIZATION>Chambers</ORGANIZATION>, averaging 26.1 points coming in, to 15 points. Chambers made 
only five of 19 shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I've played and been around Tom a long time," said Worthy. "I respect him, and 
you have to give him all your energy." 
</P>
<P>
All but four of <ORGANIZATION>A.C. Green</ORGANIZATION>'s 18 points came in the first half, when the Lakers 
made <PERCENT>61.4%</PERCENT> of their shots. All told, he made eight of nine shots and led the 
Lakers with 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Production from the forwards was needed because of the <ORGANIZATION>Lakers</ORGANIZATION>' foul trouble. 
Johnson made only six of 13 shots for 18 points and <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> scored 24. After the 
<ORGANIZATION>Suns</ORGANIZATION> took a 100-99 lead on <PERSON>Eddie Johnson</PERSON>'s basket with 7:40 left, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> 
returned to the lineup, having been preceded by <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> one possession earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson scored five more points before fouling out with 2:23 remaining. Scott 
sank three straight jump shots, then made a driving layup with 1:16 left that 
gave the Lakers a 10-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson received his fifth foul, for charging, with about four minutes to play 
in the <DATE>third quarter</DATE>. It came one possession after he incurred his fourth foul 
on a similar call. 
</P>
<P>
"I think <PERSON>Earvin</PERSON> saw that he was coming out and wanted to give it one last 
drive," <PERSON>Riley</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was replaced by <PERSON>Woolridge</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"I think 'O' was the key," Worthy said. "He made the big plays. He had some 
rebounds when we really needed them. And he can be an intimidator with his 
blocked shots." 
</P>
<P>
During his stay on the bench, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> was <PERSON>Woolridge</PERSON>'s biggest supporter. He 
waved his fist during timeouts and rushed over to offer congratulations and 
advice to <PERSON>Woolridge</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"<LOCATION>Orlando</LOCATION> gave us a spark we haven't had," <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said. "What I liked today was 
that he wasn't just making the offensive plays. He blocked some shots, got a 
big steal (late in the game) and some rebounds, too. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what we need. Early and midway through (the regular season), our bench 
wasn't (producing enough). But in the <DATE>last week</DATE> of the season and now the 
playoffs, we've got confidence in them." 
</P>
<P>
Said <PERSON>Woolridge</PERSON>, who also made five of six free throws: "In the past, I've been 
characterized as only an offensive player. But I'm working more on intangibles. 
I got a couple of rebounds and then (during a timeout), Magic came around and 
really pumped me up. Coming from a guy you respect, that gives you confidence 
and helps you to get to the next level." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Riley</PERSON> said that, by the end of the playoffs, this could be remembered as the 
deepest Laker bench of the <DATE>1980s</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's just say it should be the best," <PERSON>Riley</PERSON> said. "It should be productive. 
They are capable of doing that. Mychal and Coop always have known their roles. 
<LOCATION>Orlando</LOCATION> is starting to get into it. He's starting to lend some support." 
</P>
<P>

<DATELINE>IN EASTERN SAUDI ARABIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Scots dined on haggis, the
French had foie gras and the Americans enjoyed steak and a radio
special by comedian <PERSON>Robin Williams</PERSON>. But New Year's celebrations for
the gulf troops were generally low-key.
   The important date for the troops is <DATE>Jan. 15</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> deadline
for <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> to get out of <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> or face a possible military strike to
drive it from the emirate.
   Although soldiers yearned for a cup of kindness, New Year's was
non-alcoholic because of <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>'s strict Muslim ban on
liquor.
   ``There's no booze. What are you going to do? Have another
<ORGANIZATION>Coke</ORGANIZATION>?'' said Marine Col. <PERSON>M.L. Haiman</PERSON>, 49, of the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
``People have their eye on the 15th of <DATE>January</DATE>.''
   The troops in the multinational force have been on heightened
alert throughout the holidays in case Iraqi President <PERSON>Saddam
Hussein</PERSON> launches a pre-emptive strike.
   ``It's a prime time for the other side to come after us, on our
holidays when they think our guard might slip. If they think that,
they're wrong,'' said <PERSON>Haiman</PERSON>.
   The only official celebrations were by the approximately 3,000
men of the Scottish regiments in the <ORGANIZATION>British 1st Armored Division</ORGANIZATION>,
made up of the <ORGANIZATION>4th Armored Brigade</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>7th Armored Brigade</ORGANIZATION>, the
famed Desert Rats.
   ``All the Scots will want to celebrate Hogmanay,'' said division
spokesman Capt. <PERSON>James Myles</PERSON>, using the Scottish term for the
holiday.
   The Scots ate a traditional meal of haggis and mashed turnips,
ushered into the camps by bagpipes. Haggis is made of the heart,
liver and lungs of a sheep or calf, and minced with onions, oatmeal
and boiled in the stomach of an animal.
   The 6,000 French troops toasted with ``Saudi champagne'' - a
mixture of apple juice and <ORGANIZATION>Perrier</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Our own costs a lot more, but for that we'll have to wait for
our return,'' said <PERSON>Adjutant Robert Simon</PERSON>, spokesman for the French
forces.
   Special food like chocolate and foie gras - duck liver pate -
had been flown in from <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, he said.
   Many <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops said they had not even thought about the
holiday due to their fierce training schedules, but there were some
small celebrations.
   Many units barbecued steaks left over from <LOCATION>Christmas</LOCATION>.
   ``I'm going to get myself a six-pack of near-beer and have a
near-party and sit around and play some cards,'' said Staff Sgt.
<PERSON>David Hebert</PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION>Brickton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, in the 3rd Platoon of the
<ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>'s 595th Medical Company.
   Many troops planned to tune in to a <PERSON>Robin William</PERSON>'s special,
pre-recorded for the <ORGANIZATION>Armed Forces Radio Network</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Williams</PERSON>, re-enacting his radio role of <PERSON>Adrian Kronauer</PERSON> in the
film ``Good Morning, <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>,'' yelled, ``Good Maaawwwrning,
Saaauuudi'' and then told jokes like, ``Is it just me, or does
<PERSON>Yasser Arafat</PERSON> look like <PERSON>Ringo Starr</PERSON>?''
   While Saudis educated in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> tend to celebrate New Year's
with private parties at home, as do foreigners living here, it's
not an official Moslem holiday
   The Muslims follow a lunar calendar and their new year marks the
date when the prophet <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON>, founder of the faith, emigrated in
the 7th century from <LOCATION>Mecca</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Medina</LOCATION>, both now holy shrines in
<LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>. Their new year falls on <DATE>July 12, 1991</DATE>, on the
Christian calendar.
   There was one almost universal New Year's resolution among the
troops.
   ``They're all the same. I know what they all are: To leave and
go home,'' said Staff Sgt. <PERSON>Johnnie Montgomery</PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION>Annaston</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>, of the <ORGANIZATION>96th Civil Affairs Battalion</ORGANIZATION>.

PIERCE, 15, FACES A DIFFERENT KIND OF PRESSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Born in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, reared in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and living in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, 15-year-old <PERSON>Mary Pierce</PERSON> 
holds three passports, a No. 136 ranking and a great deal of promise. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't easy for someone so young to become part of the news, except for those 
who make a big splash in tournaments, as did 14-year-old <PERSON>Jennifer Capriati</PERSON> and 
16-year-old <PERSON>Monica Seles</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
So far, <PERSON>Pierce</PERSON> is best known for what she has left: the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Tennis Assn.</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Nick 
Bollettieri</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Tennis Academy</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Harry Hopman</PERSON>'s camp, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> and the 
lasting impression that her father, who is also her coach, might be the most 
overbearing tennis parent of all. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jim Pierce</PERSON>, 54, picked up and moved his family to his wife's native <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> 
after a row with the <ORGANIZATION>USTA</ORGANIZATION> over financial and coaching support for his daughter. 
In a recent Sports Illustrated article, the elder <PERSON>Pierce</PERSON> acknowledged, among 
other things, to once yelling during a match, "<PERSON>Mary</PERSON>, kill the bitch." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Mary Pierce</PERSON>, who said she has not read the story, is loyal to her father. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't do anything to hurt me or anything like that," <PERSON>Pierce</PERSON> said. "He's 
on the court trying to get the best out of me. I don't see anything wrong with 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what her father does, <PERSON>Pierce</PERSON> said: "Nothing, he watches me." 
</P>
<P>
The elder <PERSON>Pierce</PERSON> travels with his daughter as she struggles to break in on the 
pro tour. Coming into next week's <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Slims of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Manhattan 
Country Club</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Pierce</PERSON> has won <MONEY>$23,920</MONEY> this year and <MONEY>$31,958</MONEY> overall. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike <PERSON>Capriati</PERSON>, who signed endorsements worth <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY>, <PERSON>Pierce</PERSON> has no 
endorsement deals. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce is still highly regarded as a potential star. At 5-feet-10 and 120 
pounds, she plays an aggressive baseline game designed to put pressure on her 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, it was difficult to know for sure who <ORGANIZATION>Pierce</ORGANIZATION>'s opponent might 
be. Before the French Open, <PERSON>Pierce</PERSON> announced that she wanted to represent 
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, rejecting the <ORGANIZATION>USTA</ORGANIZATION>. She played in the Federation Cup for <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> two 
weeks ago in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Pierce</ORGANIZATION>'s task will be to try to be equal to her buildup while riding out a 
semi-controversial start. She said she can do it. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, I don't feel any pressure," <PERSON>Pierce</PERSON> said. "When I go on the court, I'm 
having fun. So I don't worry about it."

BREWER COACH TONY MUSER TENDS TO PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL SCARS AT BURN CENTER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
During his playing career, they used to call him Talking <PERSON>Tony Muser</PERSON>. He was 
non-stop fun, the butt of clubhouse jokes, the guy who always had a smile on 
his face. 
</P>
<P>
He's now the hitting coach for the <ORGANIZATION>Milwaukee Brewers</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Muser</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Los 
Alamitos</LOCATION>, recently took three hours away from a pennant race to do something 
that always came naturally -- make people smile. But this was different. It 
wasn't a laughing matter, and nobody understood that better than <PERSON>Muser</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
He was a visitor to the <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> Regional Burn Center at <ORGANIZATION>Francis Scott Key 
Hospital</ORGANIZATION>. He was there to give, and receive, therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Muser knows firsthand of the agony and depression of a burn unit. He knows 
about skin grafts, hydrotherapy treatment, body scrubs and the seemingly 
endless hours spent waiting for even a slight sign of improvement. He has been 
there -- and he is a walking, talking example of the miracles that take place 
in burn units every day. 
</P>
<P>
On <DATE>Feb. 27, 1986</DATE>, <PERSON>Muser</PERSON> was severely injured in a natural gas explosion at the 
<ORGANIZATION>Brewers</ORGANIZATION>' <DATE>spring</DATE> training complex in <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>. He suffered second- and 
third-degree burns over <PERCENT>55%</PERCENT> of his body. He was delirious for more than a week, 
incapacitated for four months and left with memories indelibly inscribed in his 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
That he is a major league coach made <PERSON>Muser</PERSON> a more recognizable visitor to the 
hospital, but being able to identify with patients made him special. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to hang in there," <PERSON>Muser</PERSON> repeated again and again. "It takes a lot of 
hard work by a lot of good people, but you'll get better." 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, the visit was paying dividends. Muser spoke with <PERSON>Mike Lorenzo</PERSON>, 
who is recovering from burns over <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> of his body. "We haven't seen him smile 
like that since he's been here," physical therapist <PERSON>Linda French</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Larry Lewis</PERSON> wasn't sure how long he had been at the burn center, only that he 
knew his accident happened on a <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. "My memory fades in and out on me," he 
said. But when he was introduced to <PERSON>Muser</PERSON>, <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON>' face lit up -- and he 
remembered. 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Tony Muser</PERSON>, yeah," <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> said. "You used to play first base for the Orioles." 
It has been 12 years since <PERSON>Muser</PERSON> finished his three-year stint in a <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
In the pediatric unit, 14-year-old Kenwan Watts eagerly talked to <PERSON>Muser</PERSON> and 
wanted to see his affected areas. Muser rolled up his sleeves to show where 
skin grafts had been performed and discussed the procedures. 
</P>
<P>
The patient visits provided a noticeable uplift, but it may have been during a 
one-hour session with the weekly support group that <PERSON>Muser</PERSON> had the most impact. 
</P>
<P>
He shared experiences with <PERSON>Bill Marshall</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mike Rose</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dennis Driscoll</PERSON>, <PERSON>Tom 
Sparks</PERSON> and <PERSON>Andy Kraft</PERSON>, all of whom had to deal with personal burn-related 
crises. Physical therapists <PERSON>Pat Prescott</PERSON> and French, occupational therapist 
<PERSON>Diane Doyle</PERSON> and social worker <PERSON>Gerrie Stancik</PERSON> sat in on the discussion, along 
with <PERSON>Nadine Weinstein</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Baltimore Regional Burn Center 
Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, who arranged <PERSON>Muser</PERSON>'s visit. 
</P>
<P>
"What you have to understand," <PERSON>Muser</PERSON> said, "is that we're dealing with people 
who really don't understand. You come to the conclusion that they're not going 
to understand. People who have been burned are a special union." 
</P>
<P>
Adjusting to the slow pace of recovery, <PERSON>Muser</PERSON> said, was the turning point of 
his mental turnaround. "When you're hurt or sick, you're used to improvement 
every day, where one day is better than the one before," he said. "I thought I 
was a tough guy who could handle anything, but you don't know how tough you can 
be until you go through something like this." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Muser</PERSON> recalled his impatience during the first weeks of his recovery, when he 
actually thought he had plotted an escape from the hospital. "I had a plan for 
my wife (<ORGANIZATION>Nancy</ORGANIZATION>) to bring a bike to the hospital and leave it outside," <PERSON>Muser</PERSON> 
said. "Then when she'd come to visit, I'd have her wheel me up and down the 
hall until nobody was watching, then we'd zip into the elevator, go downstairs, 
get on the bike and leave. 
</P>
<P>
"When she came the next day I asked her if she brought the bike. She didn't 
know what I was talking about and I got mad. Here I had this great master plan, 
which I had actually dreamed up, and she didn't bring the bike." 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, <PERSON>Muser</PERSON>'s desire to return to baseball began to dominate his mental 
approach to rehabilitation. "Baseball had been such a big part of my life that 
when it was taken away from me, and I didn't know if I could get it back, I was 
in deep depression," he said. "I had to have a goal of getting back to what I 
wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
Muser credits his recovery to the therapists who treated him, and the unique 
relationship he developed with other patients. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I could have made it without those people and support groups," 
<PERSON>Muser</PERSON> said. "When we got together like this, we'd all start talking at the same 
time -- and everybody knew what everybody else was saying. 
</P>
<P>
"Another thing . . . I didn't realize how many friends I really had. I was a 
macho baseball guy, <PERSON>Tony Muser</PERSON>, I thought I could do it all myself. Then you 
find out how many friends you have. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened is that a bad experience turned into a great love affair with a 
lot of people. I like talking about it, because I have to talk about it. It's a 
reminder (of the accident), but it's also a pick-me-up." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Muser</PERSON> was asked if he was bothered by recurring thoughts of his accident. "I 
don't think about getting burned, but if I'm in a car and somebody else is 
driving -- if that person is shaky, then I'm shaky, too," he said. "The same 
thing about flying, especially at night. It seems like I dream about a plane 
crash at least once a month. Those are situations over which I have no control. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't see my physical scars unless I take my clothes off, but the mental 
scars are still there." 
</P>
<P>
Which is why a three-hour break from a pennant race was routine for <PERSON>Muser</PERSON>. He 
met people he had never seen before, but with whom he shared a common bond. 
</P>
<P>
When he was thanked for taking the time to visit, <PERSON>Muser</PERSON> replied, "You people 
did more for me today than I did for you. What is time?" 
</P>
<P>
At the <ORGANIZATION>Baltimore Regional Burn Center</ORGANIZATION> at <PERSON>Francis Scott</PERSON> Key Hospital that day, 
time was worth a few smiles, something <PERSON>Tony Muser</PERSON> used to take for granted. 
Now, he knows better.

SCOTT, GEORGIA TECH STEAL WIN FROM NORTH CAROLINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The main thing <PERSON>Dennis Scott</PERSON> didn't want to do was rush his shot after coming up 
with a steal with five seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Scott stole an inbounds pass, calmly turned and, with two seconds left, hit his 
seventh three-point basket of the game to give <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Tech</ORGANIZATION> a 76-74 <ORGANIZATION>Atlantic 
Coast Conference</ORGANIZATION> victory over No. 5 <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> at <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"It was absolutely, totally incredible," <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Tech</ORGANIZATION> Coach <PERSON>Bobby Cremins</PERSON> said 
after the Yellow Jackets snapped a string of seven straight losses to the Tar 
Heels. "It's just unbelievable. What a steal." 
</P>
<P>
Said Scott: "This might have been the biggest shot of my whole life. The DePaul 
shot (a game-winner last season) was big, but this was UNC, the conference and 
the seniors' last home game. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I had enough time left and I didn't want to rush it. It would have 
killed me if I had missed an easy shot for the seniors." 
</P>
<P>
Scott, who scored 28 points, made the steal in the left corner, turned and hit 
the game-winning shot that gave the Yellow Jackets only their sixth victory in 
38 meetings with the Tar Heels. 
</P>
<P>
Coach <PERSON>Dean Smith</PERSON> said he was disappointed his Tar Heels couldn't wrap up their 
11th regular-season ACC crown in 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Georgia Tech</ORGANIZATION> is 20-9 overall and 8-5 in the conference. <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, which 
had a six-game winning streak snapped, is 24-6 and 9-4. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Tom Hammonds</PERSON>, the third-leading scorer in Yellow Jacket history, had his jersey 
No. 20 retired before the game. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas State 76, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> 75 -- <PERSON>Tony Massop</PERSON>'s tip-in at the buzzer gave <ORGANIZATION>Kansas 
State</ORGANIZATION> the <ORGANIZATION>Big Eight Conference</ORGANIZATION> win over seventh-ranked <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> at <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Kan.</LOCATION>, which enabled <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> to clinch the conference title. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Greg Church</ORGANIZATION>, in the best game of his career, made two free throws 
with 11 seconds remaining to give <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> a 75-74 lead. Church, a 6-8 senior 
whose previous career high was 18 points, had 31. <PERSON>Steve Henson</PERSON>, who had 23 
points for <ORGANIZATION>Kansas State</ORGANIZATION>, missed a shot as the clock wound down, but Massop 
tipped in the miss. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Kansas State</ORGANIZATION> is 18-8 and 8-5. <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, coming off a victory over <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> that 
knocked the Sooners from the No. 1 national ranking, is 23-7 and 9-4. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers missed only two of 24 free throws but still fell to 3-4 under 
interim <ORGANIZATION>Coach Rich Daly</ORGANIZATION>. The Tigers have not won on the road since <PERSON>Daly</PERSON> 
replaced <PERSON>Norm Stewart</PERSON>, who underwent cancer surgery last month and was released 
from a hospital earlier <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma 111, <ORGANIZATION>Oklahoma State</ORGANIZATION> 108 -- <PERSON>Stacey King</PERSON> scored 27 points, including a 
basket with 12 seconds left, as the fourth-ranked Sooners wrapped up the Big 
Eight title with the win at <LOCATION>Norman</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Okla</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
By winning its 29th straight at home, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> improved to 25-4 overall and 
11-2 in conference. <ORGANIZATION>Oklahoma State</ORGANIZATION>, which knocked the Sooners from the No. 1 
spot in the national with a victory earlier this season, is 16-10 and 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Oklahoma State</ORGANIZATION> pulled within a point on <PERSON>Darwyn Alexander</PERSON>'s free throw with 52 
seconds left. But when he missed his second try, <PERSON>King</PERSON> rebounded and the Sooners 
worked the clock until <PERSON>Mookie Blaylock</PERSON> drove into the lane and dished off to 
King under the basket. 
</P>
<P>
Blaylock's final assist gave him 11 in the game, making him the first player in 
<ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> history to record 200 assists and 100 steals in consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
A three-point shot by <ORGANIZATION>Oklahoma State</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Royce Jeffries</PERSON>' with four seconds left 
bounced off the rim. 
</P>
<P>
The 108 points is the most <LOCATION>Oklahoma State</LOCATION> has ever scored in a loss. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 77, <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION> 71 -- <LOCATION>Louis Banks</LOCATION> scored 24 points and <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> 
made 10 straight free throws in the final minute to cap the Metro Conference 
comeback victory over the 14th-ranked Cardinals at <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION> (19-8, 8-4), led, 55-45, with 11 minutes left when <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> took 
over. Two free throws by <PERSON>Levertis Robinson</PERSON> with 4:26 left capped an 18-7 spurt 
that gave the Bearcats the lead for good, 63-62. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati (15-11, 5-6) led, 67-65, when <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>LaBradford Smith</PERSON> missed a 
free throw three minutes later. The Bearcats then began their string of free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson 79, Duke 74 -- <PERSON>Elden Campbell</PERSON> scored six straight points to key a late 
scoring surge that carried the Tigers to the <ORGANIZATION>ACC</ORGANIZATION> upset win at <LOCATION>Clemson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION> 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 69-69, the <ORGANIZATION>Tigers</ORGANIZATION> scored seven straight points and held 
the Blue Devils scoreless for 3 1/2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson nearly lost the game at the foul line, missing four free throws in the 
final 2:22. Duke cut the lead to 76-74 on a three-point shot by <PERSON>Greg Koubek</PERSON> 
with 53 seconds left, but <PERSON>Tim Kincaid</PERSON> hit one foul shot and <PERSON>Marion Cash</PERSON> made 
two more with 24 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson is 17-9 and 6-7. Duke, which hit a season-low <PERCENT>39.2%</PERCENT> from the field, is 
21-6 and 8-5. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Devils played without junior center <PERSON>Alaa Abdelnaby</PERSON>, who was suspended 
before the game by Coach <PERSON>Mike Krzyzewski</PERSON> for academic reasons. The 6-10 
Abdelnaby is the team's fourth-leading scorer at 9.7 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 73, <ORGANIZATION>Ohio State</ORGANIZATION> 66 -- <PERSON>Jay Edwards</PERSON> scored 27 of his 34 points in the 
first half at <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, as the third-ranked Hoosiers clinched a tie for 
the <ORGANIZATION>Big Ten</ORGANIZATION> title. 
</P>
<P>
The victory moved <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> to 24-5 and 14-1. <ORGANIZATION>Ohio State</ORGANIZATION>, which lost its fifth 
straight, fell to 17-11 and 6-9. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Edwards</PERSON> hit 10 of 12 shots, including five of six three-pointers, in the first 
half as <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> built a 39-30 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Hoosiers have won the last eight games between the schools and lead the 
series, 79-57. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Ohio State</ORGANIZATION> hit 24 of 61 shots for <PERCENT>39%</PERCENT>, marking the third straight game it has

<P>
<LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> finished the regular season 24-3, its best record since a 24-2

<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Melody <PERSON>Thomas Scott</PERSON> says that in nine years
on <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>' ``The Young and the Restless'' her character has grown up
and undergone changes.
   ``When I began, <PERSON>Nikki</PERSON> was very poor, lower-class and troubled,''
she said. ``She's still troubled, but now she's rich.''
   Scott also grew up on the show. Three years ago she married the
executive producer, <PERSON>Edward Scott</PERSON>, and they are expecting their
first child at Thanksgiving.
   Although she was a teen-ager when she began the daytime serial,
she was already a veteran performer. She had worked with <PERSON>Clint
Eastwood</PERSON> twice as well as <PERSON>Kirk Douglas</PERSON>, <PERSON>John Wayne</PERSON> and <PERSON>Geraldine
Page</PERSON>.
   Her character, <PERSON>Nikki Reed Newman</PERSON>, has also packed a lot of
living into her years on ``The Young and the Restless.''
   ``She's gone through many marriages, many phases,'' said <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>.
``She's been a stripper, a model, a member of a cult and chased by
a psychotic killer. In my first story on the show my father tried
to rape me. I don't think that went over well with the audience. I
hit him over the head, he died and that was the end of that.
   ``Now I'm married to the <PERSON>Howard Hughes</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Genoa City</LOCATION>. It's not a
happy marriage. We had a storybook romance and wedding. My wedding
gown cost <MONEY>$25,000</MONEY>. It was wonderful for a while. We still live
together, but we live separate lives. Now that I'm pregnant I'm
hoping he will change his mind.''
   Her husband on the show is <PERSON>Victor Newman</PERSON>, played by <PERSON>Eric Braeden</PERSON>.
   ``I'm very happy with the show,'' said <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>. ``In my opinion
it's the best medium for an actress who wants to have a family. The
hours for a prime-time show are horrendous. I wouldn't want to be
running around the world on location. I usually don't go in until
noon. I'm usually through by 6 o'clock. It works out very good for
me.''
   Although the soap has about 25 regular characters, the main
storyline follows <PERSON>Nikki</PERSON> and her husband. The story began about 2{
years ago when ``The Young and the Restless'' began to challenge
<ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s ``General Hospital'' for the ratings leadership among the
daytime serials. In the current season, it is ranking first in the
<LOCATION>Nielsen</LOCATION> daytime ratings.
   Scott was born in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> and started her career at age 3 as
one of ``The Meglin Kiddies.'' <PERSON>Ethel Meglin</PERSON>, who recently died, had
started such other performers as <ORGANIZATION>Shirley Temple</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Judy Garland</PERSON>.
The <PERSON>Meglin</PERSON> group put on musical performances around <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.
   ``I was raised by my grandmother, who always talked about <PERSON>Jane
Withers</PERSON>,'' she said. ``She was one of my idols.'' Withers, probably
best known to current generations for her ``Josephine the Plumber''
commercials <DATE>several years ago</DATE>, was a major child star.
   Scott also appeared in commercials and did guest spots on such
shows as ``My Three Sons'' and ``Ironside.'' At 8, she played <ORGANIZATION>Tippi
Hedren</ORGANIZATION>'s daughter in ``Marnie.'' She was a regular on ``The <PERSON>Tammy
Grimes</PERSON> Show.''
   ``I never thought much about doing the shows,'' she said. ``When
you're that young you don't think about it. I thought all kids did
it.''
   When she was in junior high school she read in a trade paper
that director <PERSON>Don Siegel</PERSON> was looking for ``a chubby little girl''
to appear with <PERSON>Clint Eastwood</PERSON> and <PERSON>Geraldine Page</PERSON> in ``The
Beguiled.'' She stuffed herself to gain weight, then rented a Civil
War costume and auditioned for <PERSON>Siegel</PERSON>. She got the role, and later
when <PERSON>Siegel</PERSON> directed <PERSON>Eastwood</PERSON> in ``Dirty Harry'' he remembered her
and put her in the movie.
   She was also in ``Posse'' with <PERSON>Kirk Douglas</PERSON> and such TV movies
and miniseries as ``Studs Lonigan,'' ``Moviola'' and ``Secrets.''
She had a recurring role on ``The Waltons.''
   Scott appeared with <PERSON>John Wayne</PERSON> in his last movie, ``The
Shootist.''
   ``I played the sweet little girl in that,'' she said. ``I had a
scene with <PERSON>John Wayne</PERSON> on a streetcar. It was a thrill to do that.''
   She met her husband while doing ``The Young and the Restless.''
   ``He's been producer about 12 or 13 years,'' she said. ``For
many years we had just a working relationship. Then we became
friends and we got married three years ago.''
   She has a 5-year-old daughter, <PERSON>Alexandra</PERSON>, from an earlier
marriage, and her husband has a 15-year-old daughter, <PERSON>Jennifer</PERSON>.

TITLE FOE WARNS MORNINGSIDE; 
</P>
<P>
PREP BASKETBALL: BERKELEY HIGH COACH SAYS THE LADY MONARCHS WILL BE IN FOR A 
TOUGH FIGHT IN SATURDAY'S STATE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID RAATZ, SPECIAL TO HE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Berkeley High School</ORGANIZATION> girls basketball Coach <PERSON>Gene Nakamura</PERSON> doesn't think it 
would be prudent for Morningside to print up those "Back-to-Back State 
Champions" T-shirts just yet. 
</P>
<P>
Nakamura's comparatively unsung Yellowjackets (31-1) play the well-publicized 
Lady Monarchs (31-3) on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> at <TIME>4:45 p.m.</TIME> in the <ORGANIZATION>Oakland-Alameda County 
Coliseum Arena</ORGANIZATION> for the state Division I championship. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not awed by them at all," <PERSON>Nakamura</PERSON> said <DATE>earlier this week</DATE>. "We're 
confident, OK? They are going to have to come and play a game against us 
because we're ready to play. And when we're on our game, we play like guys, not 
girls." 
</P>
<P>
Most opponents have double- and triple-teamed 6-foot-5 Morningside center <PERSON>Lisa 
Leslie</PERSON>, who has nonetheless scored 27 points per game. But <PERSON>Nakamura</PERSON> said his 
team will often play the senior All-American with straight man-to-man defense 
<DATE>Saturday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Nakamura</PERSON> said that approach is justified because he has the better post player 
in 6-0 senior <PERSON>Jualeah Woods</PERSON>, who is averaging 18 points per game. The Lady 
Monarchs beat the Yellowjackets early last season, but <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> led for much of 
the game and eschewed gimmick defenses against <PERSON>Leslie</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, Woods played (<PERSON>Leslie</PERSON>) head up and outplayed her," <PERSON>Nakamura</PERSON> said. 
"We know what we can do, and we know what they can do. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been anxious to play them again, and the approach will be the same." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Morningside Coach <PERSON>Frank Scott</PERSON> said he is eager for his team to 
face a non-doubling defense. But he said he doubts that it will last. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope they do it that way," <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> said. "She's kind of tough to play 
one-on-one. If <PERSON>Lisa</PERSON> is effective, I think they'll have to go to the double 
team. Woods is a good player, but I don't think she can handle Lisa 
one-on-one." 
</P>
<P>
The game will be played just a few minutes down the freeway from the <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> 
campus, but <ORGANIZATION>Nakamura</ORGANIZATION> isn't counting on a big home-court advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"This season, we have not received a lot of (fan) support," said <PERSON>Nakamura</PERSON>, 
whose team trails only Morningside in the Cal-Hi Sports Weekly Division I 
ratings and won the <ORGANIZATION>Northern California Regional</ORGANIZATION> championship in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> <DATE>last 
Saturday</DATE>. "But the fact that we are playing <LOCATION>Morningside</LOCATION> is going to draw a lot 
of people because they want to see <PERSON>Lisa Leslie</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, when they come to see <PERSON>Lisa Leslie</PERSON>, they're going to see a hell of a 
<LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> team." 
</P>
<P>
Scott, who took the Monarchs to a tournament in <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> earlier this season, 
said playing in the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION> "will help (<LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>) a little, but it won't hurt 
us much. We're used to playing on the road and have played in some pretty 
foreign places." 
</P>
<P>
The Yellowjackets have outscored their opponents by an average of 36 points per 
game and feature up to six future <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> Division I players, <PERSON>Nakamura</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Starting along with <PERSON>Woods</PERSON> will be junior forward <PERSON>Alexandra Kay</PERSON>, who is 
averaging 16 points per game. Junior <PERSON>Tanda Rucker</PERSON> (18 points per game) is the 
point guard, while sophomore <PERSON>Lynda Robinson</PERSON> (13 points) and senior <PERSON>Vikki Horne</PERSON> 
(eight points) are also in <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>'s three-guard lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore <PERSON>Janet Davis</PERSON> (10 points per game) and junior <PERSON>Akiba Flanagan</PERSON> (five 
points) start at forward for the <ORGANIZATION>Lady Monarchs</ORGANIZATION>. Morningside juniors Princess 
<PERSON>Murray</PERSON> (six points) and <PERSON>Bridgete Williams</PERSON> (nine points) are the usual starting 
guards, but junior <PERSON>Tyesha Whiting</PERSON> will start in place of <ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION>, who injured 
ligaments in her leg last week. (Although it was originally thought that 
<PERSON>Williams</PERSON> was out for the season, she has a chance to play <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> 
said.)

Scott saw <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> play at this season's <ORGANIZATION>Tournament of Champions</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Santa 
Barbara</LOCATION>. The Yellowjackets suffered their only loss of the year there to <LOCATION>Los 
Angeles Washington</LOCATION>, the team Morningside beat, 61-45, for the right to 
represent <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a fine team," <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> acknowledged. "They have some good athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"(<LOCATION>Woods</LOCATION>) is a legitimate 6-footer and very quick. And they have a good guard in 
<PERSON>Tanda Rucker</PERSON>." 
</P>
<P>
Scott may be underestimating the Yellowjackets if he thinks they have just one 
good guard, according to <PERSON>Nakamura</PERSON>, who said: "I figure I've got three of the 
best guards in the state -- two of the best defensive guards and probably the 
best point in the state." 
</P>
<P>
And with <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> not starting for <ORGANIZATION>Morningside</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Nakamura</PERSON> added, his team has "a 
back-court advantage" which it will try to exploit at both ends of the court. 
</P>
<P>
"We push the ball up and play pressure defense," he said. "They will have to 
make some adjustments to play against our speed, our press and our 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
"We make very few fundamental-skill turnovers. We just don't make mistakes, and 
we do not beat ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION> hasn't played in the last two Morningside games, and <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> admitted 
that the Lady Monarchs have been susceptible to turnover problems recently. But 
he said he has confidence in his guards. 
</P>
<P>
"We've handled (<ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION>' absence) pretty well so far," he said. "I think we'll 
be OK there." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happens on the perimeter, the focus of the game for most observers 
will remain in the lane -- because that's where <PERSON>Lisa Leslie</PERSON> is. But <PERSON>Nakamura</PERSON> 
maintains that they're going to find themselves watching a lot of <PERSON>Jualeah 
Woods</PERSON>, too. 
</P>
<P>
"(<PERSON>Leslie</PERSON>) gets a lot of P.R. and so does <PERSON>Janet</PERSON> (<PERSON>Davis</PERSON>)," he said. "Woods is 
probably not getting her due. If you ask any of the college coaches on the 
coast, they'll tell you that she's an All-American. 
</P>
<P>
"Matter of fact, this <DATE>summer</DATE> at an all-star camp in <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Woods</LOCATION> got <ORGANIZATION>MVP</ORGANIZATION> 
over <LOCATION>Lisa</LOCATION>. The same schools that are after <PERSON>Lisa</PERSON> are after Jualeah."

   Bulls on the Rampage
   ----
   By Frederick C. Klein

WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A12

<LP>
   Inglewood, Calif. -- It was do or almost die for the Los
Angeles Lakers here Sunday, and they didn't. They won the
first quarter of their National Basketball Association
playoff game with the Chicago Bulls, but thoroughly lost the
last three and the game, 97-82. That put them down three
games to one in the best-of-seven championship series, a
position that's unenviable, to say the least.
   "We're in a ditch, not just a hole," said Laker coach Mike
Dunleavy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I never dreamed this would happen. I never even thought
about it," marveled <PERSON>Earvin</PERSON> "Magic" <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>, the Laker star.
   Theoretically, anything is possible, and maybe the Lakers
can win here tomorrow night and in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> <DATE>Friday</DATE> and <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
But basketball is practical stuff, and in practice the young,
dashing Bulls are stuffing <LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION> and show no signs of
stopping.
   Indeed, this series would be over already if <PERSON>Sam Perkins</PERSON>,
a 6-foot-9 Laker forward who sinks 23-foot, three-point shots
about as often as 23-foot putts, hadn't sunk one in the
closing seconds of game one in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> to boost his team to a
93-91 victory. The Bulls outscored the Lakers by a total of
44 points in winning at home <DATE>last Wednesday</DATE> and in <LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION>'s
mustard-colored Forum on <DATE>Friday</DATE> and <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, a sum that's all
the more remarkable because <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s contest went to
overtime.
   And while it is against jock-union rules to anticipate
future triumphs, <PERSON>Michael Jordan</PERSON>, the Bulls' <PERSON>Mr. Wonderful</PERSON>,
couldn't resist a peek. When the Bulls came to <LOCATION>The City</LOCATION>
Where/You Can See the <ORGANIZATION>Air</ORGANIZATION>, he'd said their goal was to win
enough games to bring the series back to <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> for game six
and, if need be, seven. But asked <DATE>Sunday</DATE> if he still wanted
to return, he grinned broadly. "Yeah," said he. "That's where
I live."
   All this is, rightly, causing joy in the <LOCATION>Windy City</LOCATION>, one
burg that has never called itself Titletown, <LOCATION>U.S.A.</LOCATION>, but
there's consternation elsewhere. As newsfolks of all stripes
have been telling us, the Bulls vs. the Lakers -- <PERSON>Michael</PERSON>
versus Magic; the first-time finalists vs. the perennial
champs -- was the <ORGANIZATION>NBA</ORGANIZATION> showdown we wanted to see. Yet it's
just about over as quick as you can say "alley-oop."
   So bad luck for the rest of us. Also for <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>, which, it is
reported, needed a long and hotly contested final to justify
the bushels of bucks it put up to broadcast the thing.
   But it's the intent of the Bulls to win as efficiently as
they can, and that's what they've done after their first-game
setback. The gang that used to be known as the <PERSON>Michael Jordan</PERSON>
Five has performed of late like a team, with a capital "T,"
and not a bit too soon. They've won 14 of their 16 playoff
games, in earlier rounds having swept <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and
defending-champ <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>, and disposed of <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, four
games to one.
   "We couldn't have picked a better time to put it all
together," noted <PERSON>John Paxson</PERSON>, their veteran guard, after
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s go.
   The Bulls' emergence as pro hoops' putative numero uno has
coincided with their dedication to defense, an
often-overlooked part of the slam-bang <ORGANIZATION>NBA</ORGANIZATION> game, and their
decision, often voiced but only recently realized, to spread
the wealth, pointswise. In the present series, they have
upset <LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION>'s patient, set-up-the-big-men style of attack by
keeping the ball out of the hands of playmaker <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> as
much as possible, and not allowing his mates to do the things
they prefer. The key to the success of those tactics has been
the kind of speed afoot that causes foes' eyes to pop.
   "It seems like they double-team everybody who gets the
ball. They even double-teamed me]" exclaimed the ponderous
<PERSON>Perkins</PERSON> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, acting as though the honor of such
attention took some of the sting from a 1-for-15 shooting
disaster that limited him to three points.
   The business of playing the game with all the fellas on
the floor instead of letting <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> do it alone might have
been more difficult, if only because <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> can do so much.
The league's leading scorer these past five campaigns, the
6-foot-5 guard possesses that rare combination of craft and
spontaneity that adds up to athletic genius.
   Interestingly, among those he's capable of surprising is
himself. On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, in a 107-86 Bulls win, he soared
basketward with the ball in his right hand, high above his
head, but on his way down changed it to his left and deftly
flipped in it through a forest of Laker arms. Watching the TV
replay later, His Highness soberly commented that the move
was "incredible," and one can only conclude he was as
entertained by it as anyone.
   But Bulls coach <PERSON>Phil Jackson</PERSON>, who's so low-key that he's
one of the few in his profession who refers to his team as
"they" rather than "we," says that sacrificing some of
<PERSON>Jordan</PERSON>'s individual brilliance was the price of success. "For
us to become a team that could win rather than be just a good
team, <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> had to give up some of the ball and some of the
spotlight," <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> says quietly. "It came down to a matter
of trust, and it didn't come quickly. But I think we have it
now."
   <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON> has led the Bulls in scoring in every game of the
playoffs, but his supporting cast also has had its share of
bouquets. <PERSON>Scottie Pippen</PERSON>, a blade-thin forward and <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s
all-around second banana, has averaged 18 points a game
against the Lakers and leads the team in playoff rebounds.
<PERSON>Horace Grant</PERSON>, a "power forward" who's quicker than he is
powerful, scored 20 points in each of games two and three on
19-for-23 shooting. <ORGANIZATION>Paxson</ORGANIZATION>, who when left to himself shoots
as well from long range as anyone, took advantage of Laker
pressure on his mates to hit on all eight of his field goal
attempts <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, and on seven of 11 <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   And <PERSON>Bill Cartwright</PERSON>, a center best known for his sharp
elbows and suffering-poet face, has been able to put his
contorted shooting style to effective use. Said <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>:
"They got the one man nobody else got {<PERSON>Jordan</PERSON>, of course},
but their other guys have really stepped up. Even Bill got
into it today."
   <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s contest wasn't the Bulls most decisive win of the
final, but it showed their advantages most clearly. After a
first quarter that ended with them trailing <DATE>2827</DATE>, they
pierced <LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION>'s defenses from outside and in while denying the
Lakers similarly. Jordan led the scoring with 28 points, but
the four other <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> starters tallied between 12 and 15
each. The Bulls shot <PERCENT>52%</PERCENT>, blocked eight shots to three for
the taller Lakers, and set a playoff-finals record by
committing just five turnovers.
   The Lakers, meantime, were hounded into shooting a poor
<PERCENT>36%</PERCENT> from the field, and their 82-point total was a 10-year
finals low. Two players -- <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> and center <PERSON>Vlade Divac</PERSON> --
accounted for 49 of their points, with most of <PERSON>Divac</PERSON>'s coming
on <ORGANIZATION>Magic</ORGANIZATION>'s radar feeds.
   In fact, it was the Lakers, not the Bulls, who looked like
the one-man team, with the twinkly eyed <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> being that
man. In game one, his team was outscored 10-0 in the five
minutes he was rested, and on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> they managed but two
free throws while he took a three-minute <DATE>second-quarter</DATE>
break.
   The Lakers seemed worn as well as weary. <PERSON>James Worthy</PERSON>,
their regular-season scoring leader who has been dogged by a
sprained ankle, played little in the <DATE>second half</DATE>, and
shooting guard <PERSON>Byron Scott</PERSON> withdrew with a shoulder injury.
   Johnson, who will turn 32 before the <DATE>summer</DATE> is done, has
poo-pooed the notion that age has caught up with his veteran
club, but he conceded that something has.
   "We anticipated a great series, not being dominated like
this," said he.

<TEXT>     Unfortunately for <ORGANIZATION>McGee</ORGANIZATION>, he wasn't even selected as a reserve to the team

All-Star picks are to be commended. In fact, your choices at several positions
are obviously better than those resulting from the fans' ballots.;    For
instance, can you believe the fans elected . . .;    (check) A's first baseman
<PERSON>Mark McGwire</PERSON> (.201 batting average) over <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Cecil Fielder</PERSON> (21 home
runs, 65 RBIs)?;    (check) <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> catcher <PERSON>Sandy Alomar</PERSON> (.219) over the A's

(.284) over <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>' <PERSON>Julio Franco</PERSON> (.318)?;    (check) <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> outfielder <PERSON>Ken
Griffey Jr.</PERSON> (.273) instead of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>' <PERSON>Ruben Sierra</PERSON> (.326)?;    Look, we know
you have nothing against the Alomars; you just knew that <PERSON>Steinbach</PERSON> and <PERSON>Franco</PERSON>
were having better seasons than they were. And if the fans were going to
overlook <ORGANIZATION>Sierra</ORGANIZATION>, they may as well have voted in <LOCATION>Ken Griffey Sr.</LOCATION>;    We also
liked your choice of <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Bobby Bonilla</PERSON> over <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Chris Sabo</PERSON>
as the <ORGANIZATION>National League</ORGANIZATION> third baseman. And the fans clearly blew it when they
voted in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> outfielder <PERSON>Darryl Strawberry.</PERSON>;    But we do have a
question for you, the readers:;    How the heck could you leave <PERSON>Andre Dawson</PERSON>
out of your lineup?;    And just when you thought it was safe to put all this

LAST SEASON: 10-12-1; 4th in league at 6-9 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The Bulldogs need a pair of pitchers' arms to heal in a 
hurry. Senior right-hander <PERSON>Jeremy Sparks</PERSON>, a returning starter who batted .500 
last season, is raring to go. But senior left-hander <PERSON>Brian Gordon</PERSON> (6-2, 190) 
and junior right-hander <PERSON>Joon Kwon</PERSON> are nursing injuries. Gordon suffered a 
shoulder injury during football season and will be the designated-hitter until 
he is able to throw. Kwon, a potentially overpowering submariner, is recovering 
from a sprained back. Left-hander <PERSON>Jason Chandler</PERSON> and right-hander <PERSON>Shawn 
Williams</PERSON> throw hard, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said, but are rough around the edges. "At this 
point, I don't want to say we're going to be strong in pitching," <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said. 
He might be wise to reserve judgment on his fielders too. Players are battling 
for positions throughout: Chandler and junior <PERSON>Jeff Kadis</PERSON> at first base; juniors 
Teddy <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> and <PERSON>Steve Rutkoske</PERSON>, both up from the junior varsity, at second; 
<LOCATION>Sparks</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> and junior <PERSON>Andy Salazar</PERSON>, at third. Senior catcher <PERSON>Steve Kelley</PERSON> 
(6-0, 200), who batted .330 last season, is a returning starter. Senior center 
fielder <PERSON>Brian Miclette</PERSON> is a first-year starter, and juniors <PERSON>Ozzie Areu</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ryan 
Woodburn</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jason Miller</PERSON> are vying for outfield positions. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> inherited a program that he claims was in disarray. 
Consequently, he is aiming for long-range goals. "We're looking to turn things 
around, but the emphasis is going to be on doing things right," he said. "We'll 
field the ground ball, hit the cut-off man and pick off people. . . . It's a 
big mistake to set goals that are unrealistic, but we're going to be 
competitive." 
</P>
<P>
Burroughs 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Coach <PERSON>Terry Scott</PERSON>, 1st year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 15-12; 3rd in league at 9-6. 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The team's top six batters graduated, and most of the current 
Indians spent last season on the junior varsity. Only three varsity players 
return and all were sophomores last season. Second baseman <PERSON>Mike Medina</PERSON> and 
shortstop <PERSON>Eddie Gavilan</PERSON>, both 5-foot-8, form a tiny but tight double-play 
tandem. "People will be amazed at what they do," <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> said. "They're good and 
they're very tough at the plate." Catcher <PERSON>Bobby Sherwood</PERSON> (5-10, 185) was a 
backup last year. Lanky right-handers <PERSON>Mike Rossiter</PERSON> (6-5, 185), a junior, and 
<PERSON>Mike Ewalt</PERSON> (6-4, 160), a side-arm senior, were the junior varsity's top 
pitchers last season. Junior third baseman <PERSON>Alex Megas</PERSON> (5-7, 145) pitched and 
played shortstop for the junior varsity. Junior first baseman <PERSON>Mike Campbell</PERSON> 
(6-1, 160), a potential power threat, moves up from the sophomore team. Junior 
<PERSON>Andy Young</PERSON> (5-10, 160), a right-handed reliever, batted .400 on the junior 
varsity last season. Senior outfielder <PERSON>Steve Bowler</PERSON> (5-10, 165) led the junior 
varsity with four home runs. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "I've got a certain amount of optimism this year, but we could be real 
tough next year," <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> said. The Indians are inexperienced, but their pitching 
might surprise. "I'm being a little prejudiced," <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> said, "but I think <PERSON>Mike 
Rossiter</PERSON> will be one of the best juniors in the <LOCATION>Valley</LOCATION>." Defense will make or 
break <LOCATION>Burroughs</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Hart 
</P>
<P>
COACH: <PERSON>Bud Murray</PERSON>, 4th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 23-7; tied for 1st in league at 10-5. 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The Indians arguably have the <ORGANIZATION>Valley</ORGANIZATION>'s best starting rotation 
in senior left-hander <PERSON>Andrew Lorraine</PERSON> and junior right-hander <PERSON>Keith Halcovich</PERSON>, 
both returning starters. Murray called <PERSON>Lorraine</PERSON> (9-5, 2.18 ERA), who combines 
an 80-plus m.p.h. fastball and a good curve, the best left-hander he has 
coached. Halcovich (9-2, 1.28) might be even better. Senior right-hander <PERSON>Kevin 
Foderaro</PERSON>, who registered a late-season shutout and a save after moving up from 
the junior varsity, is the relief ace. Six starters graduated, but the Indians 
have talent where they need it. Line-drive hitting <PERSON>Lance Migita</PERSON> (.447, 13 
doubles, three triples, 31 RBIs) moves from outfield to second base. Shortstop 
<PERSON>Rob Davis</PERSON> (.426, 30 RBIs), like <PERSON>Migita</PERSON>, enters his fourth varsity season. 
Senior third baseman <PERSON>Chad Miyata</PERSON> and junior first baseman <PERSON>R. J. Simone</PERSON>, who 
missed last season because of a broken leg, round out the infield. Junior 
catcher <PERSON>Tom Wolff</PERSON>, who started on the junior varsity last season, replaces the 
departed <PERSON>Casey Burrill</PERSON>. The outfield is new and untested, featuring seniors 
<PERSON>Garrett Emeterio</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sean Buck</PERSON>, both up from the junior varsity, and senior <PERSON>Les 
Holmes</PERSON>, a varsity reserve last season. Sophomore <PERSON>Doug Distaso</PERSON>, the quickest of 
the crew, is the likely starter in center field. Juniors <PERSON>Damon Mori</PERSON> and <PERSON>Joey 
Freitas</PERSON>, as well as Halcovich, also will play the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: <PERSON>Murray</PERSON> is amazed at prognostications favoring <PERSON>Hart</PERSON>. Despite the loss 
of several key players, however, the Indians look a heap better than their 
league foes. "I don't know how they figure that," <PERSON>Murray</PERSON> said. "But I think the 
longer we play, the better we're going to get."

'70S ROCK GROUP PROVES NOT READY FOR '90S COMEBACK

"Are you ready, <PERSON>Steve</PERSON>?" No, Sweet's original bassist <PERSON>Steve Priest</PERSON> wasn't there 
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> at the <LOCATION>Strand</LOCATION> when the group played its first <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> 
show since <DATE>1982</DATE>. He and original singer <PERSON>Brian Connolly</PERSON> had the good sense to 
leave the group years ago after its heyday. 
</P>
<P>
But don't put it past the remaining original members, guitarist <PERSON>Andy Scott</PERSON> and 
drummer <PERSON>Mick Tucker</PERSON>, to have hired a keyboardist named <PERSON>Steve</PERSON> just so they could 
re-create that classic "Are you ready?" intro to Sweet's best-known song, 
<DATE>1975</DATE>'s "Ballroom Blitz." The pair (who come to the <ORGANIZATION>Coach House</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Juan 
Capistrano</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>) certainly showed no other evidence of class <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Scott and <PERSON>Tucker</PERSON> sported poofy hair and leather duds that would look silly on 
Sunset Strip kids 20 years their junior. And with singer <PERSON>Paul Day</PERSON>, bassist <PERSON>Mal 
McNulty</PERSON> and keyboardist <PERSON>Steve Mann</PERSON> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, they played songs that sounded 
silly 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, 15 years ago, that was part of the group's charm. Looking back, 
Sweet's hard-rock-bubble-gum style (one critic termed it "Bazooka-rock") was 
the missing link between the <DATE>1910</DATE> Fruitgum Company and Twisted Sister, a 
prototype for the '80s pop-metal of <ORGANIZATION>Motley Crue</ORGANIZATION>, Quiet Riot and Poison. 
</P>
<P>
And truth be told, the group's best songs -- "Ballroom Blitz," "Action" and the 
teasingly bisexual (though sexist) "A.C.D.C." -- have weathered better than the 
band. Any one of them would make a nice hard-rock diversion on <ORGANIZATION>Rhino Records</ORGANIZATION>' 
"Have a Nice Day" '70s pop anthologies. But that's hardly enough to justify 
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s hapless display. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweet plays <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> at 8 at the <ORGANIZATION>Coach House</ORGANIZATION>, 33157 <PERSON>Camino Capistrano</PERSON>, <PERSON>San 
Juan Capistrano</PERSON>. Opening act is Stikkity. Tickets are <MONEY>$16.50</MONEY>. Call (714) 
496-8930. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweet also plays tonight at Spice in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>, <DATE>Saturday</DATE> at the Bacchanal in 
<LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> and <DATE>Monday</DATE> at the Hop in <LOCATION>Riverside</LOCATION>.

'TALKING TONY' MUSER SPEAKS FROM EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HENNEMAN, The Baltimore Evening Sun

<TEXT>
<P>
During his playing career, they used to call him "Talking Tony" <PERSON>Muser</PERSON>. He was 
non-stop fun, the butt of clubhouse jokes, the guy who always had a smile on 
his face. 
</P>
<P>
He's now the hitting coach for the <ORGANIZATION>Milwaukee Brewers</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Muser</PERSON> recently took 
three hours away from a pennant race to do something that always came naturally 
-- make people smile. But this was different. It wasn't a laughing matter, and 
nobody understood that better than <PERSON>Muser</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
He was a visitor to the <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> Regional Burn Center at <ORGANIZATION>Francis Scott Key 
Hospital</ORGANIZATION>. He was there to give, and receive, therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Muser knows firsthand of the agony and depression of a burn unit. He knows 
about skin grafts, hydrotherapy treatment, body scrubs and the seemingly 
endless hours spent waiting for even a slight sign of improvement. He has been 
there -- and he is a walking, talking example of the miracles that take place 
in burn units every day. 
</P>
<P>
On <DATE>Feb. 27, 1986</DATE>, <PERSON>Muser</PERSON> was severely injured in a natural gas explosion at the 
<ORGANIZATION>Brewers</ORGANIZATION>' <DATE>spring</DATE> training complex in <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>. He suffered second- and 
third-degree burns over <PERCENT>55 percent</PERCENT> of his body. He was delirious for more than 
a week, incapacitated for four months and left with memories indelibly 
inscribed in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
That he is a major-league coach made <PERSON>Muser</PERSON> a more recognizable visitor to the 
hospital, but being able to identify with patients made him special. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to hang in there," <PERSON>Muser</PERSON> repeated over and over again. "It takes a 
lot of hard work by a lot of good people, but you'll get better." 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, the visit was paying dividends. "We haven't seen him smile like 
that since he's been here," said physical therapist <PERSON>Linda French</PERSON> as <PERSON>Muser</PERSON> spoke 
with <PERSON>Mike Lorenzo</PERSON>, who is recovering from burns over <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of his body. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Larry Lewis</PERSON> wasn't sure how long he had been at the burn center, only that he 
knew his accident happened on a <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. "My memory fades in and out on me," he 
said. But, when he was introduced to <PERSON>Muser</PERSON>, <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON>' face lit up -- and he 
remembered. 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Tony Muser</PERSON>, yeah," said <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON>. "You used to play first base for the Orioles." 
It has been 12 years since <PERSON>Muser</PERSON> finished his three-year stint in an Orioles 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
In the pediatric unit, 14-year-old Kenwan Watts eagerly talked to <PERSON>Muser</PERSON> and was 
anxious to see his affected areas. Muser rolled up his sleeves to show where 
skin grafts had been performed and discussed the procedures. 
</P>
<P>
The patient visits provided a noticeable uplift, but it may have been during a 
one-hour session with the weekly support group that <PERSON>Muser</PERSON> had the most impact. 
</P>
<P>
He shared experiences with <PERSON>Bill Marshall</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mike Rose</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dennis Driscoll</PERSON>, <PERSON>Tom 
Sparks</PERSON> and <PERSON>Andy Kraft</PERSON>, all of whom had to deal with personal burn-related 
crises. Physical therapists <PERSON>Pat Prescott</PERSON> and French, occupational therapist 
<PERSON>Diane Doyle</PERSON> and social worker <PERSON>Gerrie Stancik</PERSON> sat in on the discussion, along 
with <PERSON>Nadine Weinstein</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Baltimore Regional Burn Center 
Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, who arranged <PERSON>Muser</PERSON>'s visit. 
</P>
<P>
"What you have to understand," said <PERSON>Muser</PERSON>, "is that we're dealing with people 
who really don't understand. You come to the conclusion that they're not going 
to understand. People who have been burned are a special union." 
</P>
<P>
Adjusting to the slow pace of recovery, <PERSON>Muser</PERSON> said, "was the turning point of 
my mental turnaround. When you're hurt or sick, you're used to improvement 
every day, where one day is better than the one before. I thought I was a tough 
guy who could handle anything, but you don't know how tough you can be until 
you go through something like this." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Muser</PERSON> recalled his impatience in the first weeks of his recovery, when he 
actually thought he had plotted an escape from the hospital. "I had a plan for 
my wife (<ORGANIZATION>Nancy</ORGANIZATION>) to bring a bike to the hospital and leave it outside," said 
<PERSON>Muser</PERSON>. "Then when she'd come to visit, I'd have her wheel me up and down the 
hall until nobody was watching, then we'd zip into the elevator, go downstairs, 
get on the bike and leave. 
</P>
<P>
"When she came the next day I asked her if she brought the bike. She didn't 
know what I was talking about and I got mad. Here I had this great master plan, 
which I had actually dreamed up, and she didn't bring the bike." 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, <PERSON>Muser</PERSON>'s desire to return to baseball began dominating his mental 
approach to rehabilitation. "Baseball had been such a big part of my life that 
when it was taken away from me, and I didn't know if I could get it back, I was 
in deep depression," <PERSON>Muser</PERSON> said. "I had to have a goal of getting back to what 
I wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
Muser hit a chord when he left little doubt that he credits his recovery to the 
therapists who treated him, and the unique relationship he developed with other 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember we had a nurse named <PERSON>Judy</PERSON>, we called her 'Iron Brush' and I don't 
even know her last name," said <PERSON>Muser</PERSON>. "I don't have to know her last name -- 
but she saved my life. When we left we got a piece of plywood and nailed an 
iron brush and a washcloth to it and gave it to her as a trophy." 
</P>
<P>
"We have one here, too," said <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON>. "Her name is Theresa, and she knows how 
much we appreciate her." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I could have made it without those people and support groups," 
said <PERSON>Muser</PERSON>. "When we got together like this, we'd all start talking at the same 
time -- and everybody knew what everybody else was saying. 
</P>
<P>
"Another thing ... I didn't realize how many friends I really had. I was a 
macho baseball guy, <PERSON>Tony Muser</PERSON>, I thought I could do it all myself. Then you 
find out how many friends you have. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened is that a bad experience turned into a great love affair with a 
lot of people. I like talking about it, because I have to talk about it. It's a 
reminder (of the accident), but it's also a pick-me-up." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Muser</PERSON> was asked if he was bothered by recurring thoughts of his accident. "I 
don't think about getting burned, but if I'm in a car and somebody else is 
driving -- if that person is shaky, then I'm shaky, too," said <PERSON>Muser</PERSON>. "The same 
thing about flying, especially at night. It seems like I dream about a plane 
crash at least once a month. Those are situations over which I have no control. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't see my physical scars unless I take my clothes off, but the mental 
scars are still there." 
</P>
<P>
Which is why a three-hour break from a pennant race was routine for <PERSON>Muser</PERSON>. He 
met people he had never seen before, but with whom he shared a common bond. 
</P>
<P>
When he was thanked for taking the time to visit, <PERSON>Muser</PERSON> replied, "You people 
did more for me today than I did for you. What is time?" 
</P>
<P>
At the <ORGANIZATION>Baltimore Regional Burn Center</ORGANIZATION> at <PERSON>Francis Scott</PERSON> Key Hospital that day, 
time was worth a few smiles, something <PERSON>Tony Muser</PERSON> used to take for granted. 
Now, he knows better.

LAKERS FINALLY LOOK AT HOME ON THE 'ROAD'; 
</P>
<P>
THEY END LOSING STREAK BY BEATING CLIPPERS, 116-95 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There might as well have been a giant magnifying glass over the Sports Arena 
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, for all the microscopic analysis that was going on during the 
<ORGANIZATION>Lakers</ORGANIZATION>' 116-95 victory over the <ORGANIZATION>Clippers</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the people-watching, matinee style, the focus of attention from the crowd 
of the 15,352 belonged to: 
</P>
<P>
 -- <PERSON>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</PERSON> and his 2-week evaluation period to remain the Laker 
starting center. 
</P>
<P>
 -- <PERSON>Gene Shue</PERSON> and his daily evaluation period to remain as Clipper coach. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Streaks, on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
As for the latter, the Lakers (24-12) won on the road for the first time after 
8 straight defeats, a skid that had dragged out since <DATE>Dec. 13</DATE>. Meanwhile, the 
Clippers (10-26) suffered their ninth consecutive loss and 20th in 24 games. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar was hardly the key, but his second-half play inside, when the 
Lakers turned a modest 65-57 halftime lead into an eventual 22-point cushion, 
was another bright spot for <ORGANIZATION>Laker Coach Pat Riley</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The much-scrutinized center, who came in averaging 9.4 points and 4.1 rebounds, 
finished at 12 and 5, respectively, while tying his season-high in minutes 
played, 31. He scored 10 of the points, on 5-of-10 shooting, and got all 5 
rebounds in his 18 second-half minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel a lot better now," <PERSON>Abdul-Jabbar</PERSON> said of his shooting touch. "I feel my 
shots will go in. Before, they just flew out of my hands. 
</P>
<P>
"I can play the minutes, physically. Mentally, I think I've come up a step or 
two and I think I've been improving. I just haven't been used to being part of 
the offense. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to come back exactly when I (get the minutes). But I think I'm 
approaching it. Another game or so and I'll be OK." 
</P>
<P>
Which is more than can be said for the <ORGANIZATION>Clippers</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
With <PERSON>Shue</PERSON>'s job possibly hanging in the balance -- even though team owner 
<PERSON>Donald T. Sterling</PERSON> was out of town and president <PERSON>Alan Rothenberg</PERSON> was at home 
ill -- the Clippers played well enough in the first half before the Lakers made 
it a rout. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the <ORGANIZATION>Clippers</ORGANIZATION> played well above their recent standards in the first 
half, shooting <PERCENT>60.5%</PERCENT> from the field, to trail by eight points. That they were 
falling behind, though playing good, said plenty about how the Lakers looked. 
</P>
<P>
"It means we were playing against the world champions," said Clipper guard 
<PERSON>Quintin Dailey</PERSON>, who scored 20 of his team-high 24 points in the first half. "We 
turned the ball over in key situations. And when you do that against the 
Lakers, they're off to the races." 
</P>
<P>
Said <PERSON>Shue</PERSON>, who may have coached his last game at the Sports Arena with the 
Clippers: "I thought the Lakers played great. In the <DATE>first half</DATE>, we played 
very, very well. As a matter of fact, I don't think we could play much better." 
</P>
<P>
The Laker lead increased steadily in the second half, to 20 points, then to 21 
and, finally, to 22, at 115-93, on <PERSON>Mark McNamara</PERSON>'s layin with 48 seconds to 
play. Along the way, the Clippers had only 35 rebounds, a season low and an 
abysmal number by any standard. The Lakers had 53. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Benoit Benjamin</PERSON> had 13 rebounds and 21 points on 9-of-12 shooting. It was his 
fourth straight game of double-figure rebounds, and he is also averaging 16.8 
points in the last 4 games. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm getting back to the way I'm capable of playing," said <PERSON>Benjamin</PERSON>, 
who, for a change, is not one of the subjects under the microscope. "I was 
getting shifted around (between being a starter and a reserve), but now I'm 
coming back to where I was before being benched." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers looked like the Lakers of old on the road. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was their second straight impressive performance. Last <DATE>Friday</DATE> in 
the Forum, they defeated <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>, the team with the <ORGANIZATION>National Basketball 
Assn.</ORGANIZATION>'s best record, 116-95. 
</P>
<P>
Five players scored in double figures against the Clippers, led by <PERSON>Byron 
Scott</PERSON>'s 28 points, <ORGANIZATION>Magic Johnson</ORGANIZATION>'s 22 (and 12 assists) and <PERSON>James Worthy</PERSON>'s 21. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Laker-Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Clipper guard <PERSON>Gary Grant</PERSON> missed his second straight game with a bruised right 
thigh. His status for <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s game at <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> is uncertain. . . . <PERSON>Tom 
Garrick</PERSON>, who has seen time at point guard with <ORGANIZATION>Grant</ORGANIZATION>'s injury and inconsistent 
play, sprained his left ankle in the <DATE>second quarter</DATE> and did not return. X-rays 
will be taken today as a precautionary move, but his availability for the game 
against the SuperSonics is also unknown. . . . After a career high in points 
(35) and rebounds (20) in <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s loss to <ORGANIZATION>Golden State</ORGANIZATION>, Clipper forward <PERSON>Ken 
Norman</PERSON> set another career best against the Lakers with 7 assists. . . . <PERSON>Laker 
Mychal Thompson</PERSON>, on this "road" game: "It was rough. There was adversity. I was 
hitting every light coming here. I couldn't believe it. A couple of police cars 
came flashing by, and I don't know what. . . . The scariest part is that I've 
got to drive back."

<PERSON>Mike O'Hara</PERSON>, the sports promoter who helped develop the <ORGANIZATION>American Basketball

<P>
 The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is meeting the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> in the championship match of the 
World (<ORGANIZATION>Volleyball</ORGANIZATION>) League and the Forum is sold out. A billion people, watching 
on a worldwide TV network, see <PERSON>Scott Fortune</PERSON> hit the winning point for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Hmm? Sounds as if <PERSON>O'Hara</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> volleyball star, got spiked in the 
head one too many times. But they laughed when <PERSON>O'Hara</PERSON> devised the three-point 
shot for the <ORGANIZATION>American Basketball Assn.</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>World Hockey Assn.</ORGANIZATION> began signing 
underaged players such as <PERSON>Wayne Gretzky</PERSON> and Pro-Track started paying runners. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>ABA</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>WHA</ORGANIZATION> and Pro-Track were each making money when <PERSON>O'Hara</PERSON> left, and he 
predicts that the World League, which begins play <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at the Forum, will 
succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all the things I've been involved in, I've never seen a league that has 
started with the credibility, experience and capital that this league has," 
<PERSON>O'Hara</PERSON> said. "Usually you sweat out the first year." 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>O'Hara</PERSON> isn't sweating. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>World League</ORGANIZATION> has a <MONEY>$4-million</MONEY> budget, of which <MONEY>$3 million</MONEY> will be 
underwritten by corporate sponsors and <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> by TV contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"The <ORGANIZATION>NBA</ORGANIZATION> didn't start out this well," <PERSON>O'Hara</PERSON> said. "The <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> didn't start out 
this well. All those leagues started out real shaky, but people forget about 
their humble beginnings." 
</P>
<P>
Is the world ready for the World League? 
</P>
<P>
It makes sense from a business and marketing standpoint. <ORGANIZATION>SportsChannel</ORGANIZATION>, which 
will televise the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> matches, is a cable network hungry for quality 
programming. And volleyball, which all but disappears in non-Olympic years, 
needs the exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Fortune, who hit the winning shot in the gold-medal match in the <DATE>1988</DATE> Olympics, 
predicts success for the <ORGANIZATION>World League</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be really big, especially in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>," Fortune said. "The 
world championships are big in a lot of countries, but Americans don't really 
follow volleyball until the Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
O'Hara has experience promoting volleyball, having run the Team Cup volleyball 
league at the Forum since <DATE>1984</DATE>. Team Cup matches average 2,000 fans with the 
finals drawing 5,000. O'Hara hopes to expand on the base of <ORGANIZATION>Southland</ORGANIZATION> 
volleyball fans. 
</P>
<P>
Although the league has already met its budget, it could be be a hard sell in 
<LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> because the six-week season, which runs from <DATE>April</DATE> to <DATE>June</DATE>, 
conflicts with the <ORGANIZATION>NBA</ORGANIZATION> playoffs. Although the <ORGANIZATION>World League</ORGANIZATION> will move to the 
<DATE>summer</DATE> next year, the initial season was set for this <DATE>spring</DATE> so it wouldn't 
conflict with the World Cup soccer tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if we struggle this year, I think we'll be successful next year because 
we won't be competing against the Lakers," said <PERSON>John Root</PERSON>, a member of the <DATE>1988</DATE> 
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. Olympic</ORGANIZATION> team. "All we have to do is go up against baseball." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>O'Hara</PERSON> said: "The break-even point from a league standpoint has already been 
assured. Each of the teams will look to gate receipts and local sponsorships. 
The jury is still out on how we're going to do this year. I'd be delighted if 
we broke even." 
</P>
<P>
The brainchild of <PERSON>O'Hara</PERSON> and Laker owner <PERSON>Jerry Buss</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>World League</ORGANIZATION> is 
composed of the national volleyball teams from eight countries: the <LOCATION>United 
States</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and the 
<LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Sanctioned by the <ORGANIZATION>International Volleyball Federation</ORGANIZATION>, the league hopes to add 
four teams next year: <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The eight teams are divided into two divisions, with the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> grouped 
with <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>. Each team will play 12 matches, six home and six 
away, during the season. The top two teams from each division will meet in a 
four-match championship final in <LOCATION>Osaka</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, <DATE>July 14-15</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The teams will receive a total of <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> in prize money. Teams receive 
<MONEY>$1,500</MONEY> for each match they win, <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> for each loss. The division champions 
will receive <MONEY>$80,000</MONEY>, with second place worth <MONEY>$60,000</MONEY>, third place <MONEY>$40,000</MONEY>, and 
fourth place <MONEY>$30,000</MONEY>. The playoff champion will win <MONEY>$140,000</MONEY>, with the 
second-place team getting <MONEY>$110,000</MONEY>, the third-place team <MONEY>$80,000</MONEY> and the 
fourth-place team <MONEY>$60,000</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
There are also individual prizes. The league's most valuable player will get 
<MONEY>$15,000</MONEY>, with <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> prizes to be awarded the best spiker, best blocker, best 
setter and best defensive player. The outstanding referee will receive <MONEY>$5,000</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> volleyball team, who earn an average stipend of <MONEY>$1,500</MONEY> per 
month, like the league's monetary rewards. 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> national team, which requires a full-time commitment, has been losing 
its best players to Italian club teams, which offer six-figure salaries. 
</P>
<P>
"The Italians have upped volleyball to a different level with the money they're 
paying now," said Fortune. "It's real difficult for (the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>) to deal 
with because we don't have the money or the sponsors to pay the players to stay 
around instead of going to <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> team is rebuilding after the retirement of <PERSON>Karch Kiraly</PERSON> and <PERSON>Steve 
Timmons</PERSON>, who led the team to gold medals in the last two Olympics. Three other 
players have left the national team to play in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>: <PERSON>Jeff Stork</PERSON>, the starting 
setter on the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> team since <DATE>1985</DATE>; <PERSON>Bob Ctvrtlik</PERSON>, who was voted best defensive 
player at the <DATE>1988</DATE> Olympics, and <PERSON>Adam Johnson</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> standout who was 
voted <DATE>1986</DATE> NCAA player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Fortune, the youngest player on the <DATE>1988</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Olympic</ORGANIZATION> team, and Root, a reserve 
on that team, rejected offers from Italian teams to remain with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> team. 
</P>
<P>
How could that be? 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us still have something to prove," Root said. "But in light of the 
fact that they're (the <ORGANIZATION>United States Volleyball Federation</ORGANIZATION>) giving us the 
option of going to <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> and coming back over (to join the <DATE>1992</DATE> Olympic team), 
a lot of the guys are going to take advantage of that option." 
</P>
<P>
Although <PERSON>Kiraly</PERSON> and <PERSON>Timmons</PERSON> were listed on the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> roster for the <ORGANIZATION>World 
League</ORGANIZATION>, they will not compete this season. 
</P>
<P>
"They were the heart and soul of the team," Fortune said. "I talked to <PERSON>Steve</PERSON> 
and he said that before the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> became a good team they went through a real 
difficult period, which is what we're going through now. We have a bunch of 
young kids who are trying to come together as a team." 
</P>
<P>
Said Root: "We have to find new players we can focus on and build a campaign 
around. Scott and I have been around the longest and hopefully we can provide 
the leadership that the coaches are looking for to bring the young guys 
around." 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the players are young. 
</P>
<P>
With the departure of <ORGANIZATION>Stork</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> team's biggest problem was finding an 
experienced setter. The problem was solved by coaxing <PERSON>Rod Wilde</PERSON> out of 
retirement. Wilde, 34, had coached at <LOCATION>Pepperdine</LOCATION> since suffering a leg injury 
that knocked him out of the <DATE>1984</DATE> Games. 
</P>
<P>
Wilde, who coached against many of the players on the team, is adjusting to 
being a player again. He is 12 years older than the average age of the players. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> also created a void at outside hitter, which will be filled 
by Root, who has been used primarily as a middle blocker. The other starting 
outside hitter is <PERSON>Troy Tanner</PERSON>, who led <ORGANIZATION>Pepperdine</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> titles in <DATE>1985</DATE> and 
<DATE>1986</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Fortune and <PERSON>Mark Arnold</PERSON> are expected to start at middle blocker, and <PERSON>Chris 
Braun</PERSON> will start at opposite hitter. 
</P>
<P>
The toughest competition in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>' division is expected to come 
from <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, which won the <DATE>1989</DATE> European Championship and finished second behind 
<LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> at the <DATE>1989</DATE> World Cup. The <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> is favored in the other division.

RILEY SAYS LAKERS NOT MAKING THE GRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You probably thought the Lakers were playing well this season. Their 21-6 
record indicates as much. Opponents have offered unsolicited praise. Most in 
the media have lauded their effort. 
</P>
<P>
But is Coach <PERSON>Pat Riley</PERSON> satisfied? Not according to a statistical evaluation he 
and his staff gave to Laker players before their final practice of <DATE>1989</DATE> on 
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Riley</PERSON> said that starters and reserves alike are not producing strong enough 
individual statistics in the usual areas -- field goal percentage, rebounding, 
turnovers, steals and assists -- compared to previous seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"They are all down," <PERSON>Riley</PERSON> said. "Overall, from a number standpoint, our top 
four guys (Magic <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>, <PERSON>James Worthy</PERSON>, <PERSON>Byron Scott</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>A.C. Green</ORGANIZATION>) are all 
down at least 12 to <PERCENT>18%</PERCENT> from last year in some areas and are down a hell of a 
lot more from their best years. 
</P>
<P>
"Every one of our players is down in certain areas we think are important. 
We've tried to establish some guidelines for them to shoot for, but it's up to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"Individuals have to want to keep striving. If they're just content with 
winning, then they may not have individual success. The team will carry them. 
But if they can get into increasing their performance, it'll help the team that 
much more." 
</P>
<P>
Added <PERSON>Riley</PERSON>: "The individual player has to be most responsible for his 
individual play across the board. Getting 22 points and 10 rebounds a game -- 
that means nothing to me. They've got to try to develop some consistency in 
their total game. They need to know these things. 
</P>
<P>
"If they can just improve <PERCENT>1%</PERCENT> (individually) in a number of these areas . . . 
That <PERCENT>1%</PERCENT> could be five-tenths of a rebound or one-tenth of a steal (per game). 
You multiply that <PERCENT>1%</PERCENT> by 12 (players), you'll get a significant improvement in 
team performance." 
</P>
<P>
Laker players have come to expect such scrutiny of their performances from 
<LOCATION>Riley</LOCATION>. His New Year's Day report card -- they reportedly used to include letter 
grades, but no longer -- has been a standard for the past three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
This time, they expected a poor report, since the team field goal percentage 
and points per game have dropped significantly. 
</P>
<P>
"We're used to it," <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said. "If we didn't have this report card, 
everybody would be looking at (<ORGANIZATION>Riley</ORGANIZATION>) funny. You're always looking for those 
notes he sends us in the <DATE>summer</DATE> and these marks. You always know where you 
stand." 
</P>
<P>
Before talking in generalities about his players' deficiencies, <PERSON>Riley</PERSON> outlined 
his statistical formula. 
</P>
<P>
"We took the (individual) stats from the <DATE>last three years</DATE> and their individual 
best year (if it is a different season), then we showed them the team's best 
year, which was (1984-85)," <PERSON>Riley</PERSON> said. "And that's what we've compared to this 
season." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' four "core" players -- <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>, Worthy, <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Green</ORGANIZATION> -- are down 
in several areas, according to <PERSON>Riley</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Scott's combined shooting percentage in the four seasons <PERSON>Riley</PERSON> mentioned was 
<PERCENT>51.1%</PERCENT> This season, <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> has made <PERCENT>45.2%</PERCENT> of his shots. Scott had averaged 18.5 
points in the four seasons; 16.1 this season. 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Byron</PERSON>'s shooting percentage is down, and he knows he needs to improve on 
that," said <PERSON>Riley</PERSON>, who added that <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>'s rebounding and assists totals are 
slightly down from his best season. 
</P>
<P>
Said <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>: "What it is is a friendly reminder of what you're doing out there. 
It doesn't put pressure on you, but it lets you know. Numbers don't lie. I 
mean, you can get 20 points, but not have a good game." 
</P>
<P>
Green, according to <PERSON>Riley</PERSON>, needs to work on his field goal percentage, assists 
and also reduce his fouls. Green's rebounding average has improved from 8.5 a 
game in the four seasons in question to 9.4 this season. But his fouls have 
risen from 2.3 a game to 2.7, and his blocked shots are down to 0.74 from a 
career high of 1.01 in <DATE>1986-87</DATE>. "Across the board, <LOCATION>A.C.</LOCATION> has to improve in each 
area except his rebounding, which is good," <PERSON>Riley</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Green: "I think it's a good evaluation tool. Coach <PERSON>Riley</PERSON> points out those 
things so that you're aware of it. If I can improve <PERCENT>1%</PERCENT> in each area, I'll be 
that much better." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and Worthy, the two most reliable Lakers, also saw a few statistical 
areas highlighted with a marking pen on their report cards. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy's steals are down from 1.2 over the four-season span to 0.88 this 
season. His shooting percentage has dropped <PERCENT>3%</PERCENT> and his turnovers have increased 
to 2.3 from a low of 1.9 in <DATE>1985-86</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said the faults <PERSON>Riley</PERSON> found in his game were his field goal percentage 
of 47.1 this season compared to 51.9 in the four seasons, and his 88.8 
free-throw percentage compared to his NBA-best <PERCENT>91.1%</PERCENT> last season. 
</P>
<P>
"There are things you still have to improve on as a player," Worthy said. 
"There's a lot of little things, like turnovers. Everybody on the team has a 
category, steals for me. I've got to get my turnovers down to like it was in 
(the 1985-86 season). I've also got to foul less." 
</P>
<P>
Added Johnson: "(<PERSON>Riley</PERSON>) wants my shooting percentage better. He says I'm good 
inside, but it's on the perimeter where I got to improve. The other thing is 
free throws, but I know I'll improve that." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the standard <ORGANIZATION>NBA</ORGANIZATION> statistics, the Laker staff charts such obscure 
categories as players' shooting accuracy from different spots on the court. 
Center <PERSON>Mychal Thompson</PERSON>, the fifth Laker starter, said every category on his 
report card was highlighted for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's embarrassing," <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> said. "No matter how long I stayed out of school, 
I still get failing grades. I never made the dean's list in college. But I 
don't care. Just once, I'd like to make <PERSON>Riley</PERSON>'s list." 
</P>
<P>
Riley, however, takes these motivational tools seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't going to make or break them, in terms of playing time," <PERSON>Riley</PERSON> said of 
the performance reviews. "But they know it's important. They were nodding at 
me, as if saying, 'You're right.' Well, let's see some results now."
