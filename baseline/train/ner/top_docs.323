the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Rangers</ORGANIZATION> and tramping through a <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> swamp with an
alligator hunter.
   He's not sure if it was all worth it.
   ``You could do all the research in the world _ sometimes it pays
off, sometimes it doesn't,'' <PERSON>Duvall</PERSON> says in the <DATE>March</DATE> issue of
Smart magazine. ``Sometimes you don't have time. You got to be a

   <PERSON>Duvall</PERSON>, who won an Oscar for ``Tender Mercies'' and starred in
``The Godfather'' and ``The Great Santini,'' says he's a stickler
for detail in his characters and in films in general.
   ``When actors start acting bigger than life, bigger than the
people they play, then they're in trouble,'' <PERSON>Duvall</PERSON> said. ``For
example, I can't even talk about `Gone With the Wind.' You don't
see people in the South like that. It's a joke.''

<LEADPARA>  Queen Elizabeth II, one of the world's richest women, pays no income tax. A
large majority of Britons think that's wrong, by one poll, and legislator

levied on all of her considerable assets, the exact value of which are kept

<TEXT>     The Liberal Democrat's bill apparently stands no chance of becoming law
because both the Conservative government and the leadership of the opposition
<ORGANIZATION>Labor Party</ORGANIZATION> oppose it. They don't want to upset the monarchy or its
supporters.;    But the bill was expected to test parliamentary opinion on an
issue that has attracted much media attention.;    Conservative legislator
<PERSON>Anthony Beaumont-Dark</PERSON>, Labor legislator <PERSON>Brian Wilson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hughes</PERSON> called in an
Independent Television program last week for the queen to pay taxes.;    The
rest of the royal family pays taxes.;    An opinion poll published by The
Independent on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> some weeks ago said <PERCENT>79 percent</PERCENT> of 1,090 Britons
questioned in <DATE>February</DATE> thought the queen should be taxed. The newspaper gave
no margin of error.;    Hughes estimates the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> could raise <MONEY>$11.2
million</MONEY> a year if the queen's income were taxed. He told the <ORGANIZATION>British
Broadcasting Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in a radio program <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>: "It is completely unfair that
the richest woman in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> should be exempt.";    <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION>
officials say the queen's fortune, which includes jewel and art collections,
race horses and real estate, is a private matter. Media estimates of its worth
vary widely.;    The British magazine Harpers and Queen in <DATE>February</DATE> named her
as the world's richest woman with assets of <MONEY>$10.5 billion</MONEY>. Fortune magazine
estimated the value of her investments alone at the end of the <DATE>1980s</DATE> at <MONEY>$3.5
billion.</MONEY>;    But the Independent said <DATE>today</DATE> it was a myth that she has
billions invested. It said palace officials were content with estimates
valuing her investments at <MONEY>$192 million.</MONEY>;    A survey by the Independent today
said that elsewhere in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, the Spanish, Swedish, Belgian and Dutch royal
families all pay tax on their private fortunes. It said only the Norwegian and
Danish monarchies do not pay taxes, but they are among the royal families on
the continent with the fewest holdings.;    The queen's defenders say she
already contributes to the Exchequer through her <PERSON>Crown Estates</PERSON>, which include
farmland and <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> real estate, officially valued at nearly <MONEY>$3.8 billion</MONEY> last

spot. The former poor farmer saw his <PERCENT>65 percent</PERCENT> stake in <ORGANIZATION>Cathay Life

securities laws, joined the list at No. 125, with an estimated
fortune of <MONEY>$1.2 billion</MONEY>.
   The Sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, who presides over the small oil-rich nation

an estimated fortune of <MONEY>$25 billion</MONEY>, the magazine stated.
   King Fahd of <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION> and his family are next with <MONEY>$18
billion</MONEY>, followed by <ORGANIZATION>Forrest E. Mars Sr.</ORGANIZATION> and the Mars candy-bar
clan, who are estimated to be worth <MONEY>$12.5 billion</MONEY>.
   Ranked fourth after the Mars family was the world's richest
woman, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth II</PERSON>, who is worth an estimated <MONEY>$10.9
billion</MONEY> compared with <MONEY>$8.7 billion</MONEY> last year, Fortune reported.
   Fifth on the list were New York-based publishing magnates <PERSON>Samuel
I. Newhouse Jr.</PERSON> and <PERSON>Donald E. Newhouse</PERSON>, worth an estimated <MONEY>$10
billion</MONEY>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart Stores</ORGANIZATION> mogul <PERSON>Sam Moore Walton</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Bentonville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ark.</LOCATION>, was
seventh with <MONEY>$8.9 billion</MONEY>; the <PERSON>Reichmann</PERSON> brothers _ <PERSON>Albert</PERSON>, <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Ralph</PERSON> _ whose Ontario-based <ORGANIZATION>Olympia &amp; York</ORGANIZATION> is the largest owner of
<LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> commercial real estate, are eighth with <MONEY>$8.4 billion</MONEY>;
British real estate tycoon <PERSON>Gerald Grosvenor</PERSON> is ninth with <MONEY>$6.9

   If you wondered why oil is worth fighting for,
take a look at Fortune magazine's latest ranking of the world's
billionaires.
   The two richest people on the face of the earth are oil barons,
the magazine reported <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   Sultan <PERSON>Haji Hassanal Bolkiah</PERSON>, oil-rich leader of the tiny
<LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> sultanate of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, retained Fortune's top title for the
fourth straight year with an estimated worth of <MONEY>$25 billion</MONEY>,
unchanged from <DATE>1989</DATE>.
   Saudi Arabia's <ORGANIZATION>King Fahd</ORGANIZATION> and clan, a focus of the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION>
crisis, ranked second with assets worth <MONEY>$18 billion</MONEY>, also unchanged
from last year.
   Fortune spokeswoman <PERSON>Emma Dockendorff</PERSON> said those estimates were
based partly on oil prices in mid-July, when one barrel of crude
fetched about <MONEY>$18</MONEY>.
   Prices have since surged to about <MONEY>$28</MONEY> a barrel following <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>'s
<DATE>Aug. 2</DATE> invasion of <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> move to protect neighboring
<LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>. That price jump would make the sultan and the king
potentially even wealthier.
   The ranks of Fortune's richest _ bankrolled by assets ranging
from oil to sneakers to ball bearings _ swelled by 25 names this
year to 182 individuals and families, controlling a combined empire
worth <MONEY>$471.3 billion</MONEY>.
   That's up about <PERCENT>7 percent</PERCENT> from last year and enough to erase the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> budget deficit, trade deficit and a good chunk of the savings
&amp; loan bailout tab.
   Fortune released the fourth annual ranking in its <DATE>Sept. 10</DATE>
issue. It said the average entrant's wealth was only slightly
higher compared with last year after adjusting for inflation.
   But the average fortune was still worth about <MONEY>$2.6 billion</MONEY>,
which if invested in <PERCENT>7.5 percent</PERCENT> <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bills would earn
<MONEY>$534,000</MONEY> a day.
   ``True, you shouldn't feel too sorry for folks who have their
own islands and castles, use Reniors for wallpaper and control, in
the aggregate, <MONEY>$471.3 billion</MONEY>,'' Fortune said.
   As competitor Forbes magazine did in its annual list released
last month, Fortune ditched the Sultan of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Donald J.
Trump</PERSON>, whose real estate and casino empire is bogged down in debt.
The magazine had estimated his holdings at <MONEY>$1.7 billion</MONEY> last year.
   Fortune placed <ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION> in a separate category of fallen tycoons,
who also included troubled takeover strategist <PERSON>James Goldsmith</PERSON> and
convicted financier <PERSON>Michael Milken</PERSON>.
   Ranked third on Fortune's list was the reclusive Mars family of
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, whose holdings include <ORGANIZATION>Mars Inc.</ORGANIZATION> candy bars,
<ORGANIZATION>Uncle Ben</ORGANIZATION>'s Rice and Kal-Kan pet food, worth <MONEY>$12.5 billion</MONEY>.
   Fourth was <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth II</PERSON>, the wealthiest woman,
with an untaxed personal fortune of <MONEY>$11.7 billion</MONEY> in riches ranging
from 267,000 acres of <ORGANIZATION>Royal</ORGANIZATION> real estate to racehorses, crown jewels
and a vast stock portfolio.
   Fifth was the <PERSON>Newhouse</PERSON> family of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, owners of a
large media empire, worth <MONEY>$11.5 billion</MONEY>; sixth was the <PERSON>Reichmann</PERSON>
family of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, with extensive real estate holdings valued at
<MONEY>$11.1 billion</MONEY>; tied for seventh were <PERSON>Yoshiaki Tsutsumi</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s
richest industrialist, and <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> retailing mogul <PERSON>Sam Walton</PERSON>,
both valued at <MONEY>$7.3 billion</MONEY>; eighth was <PERSON>John W. Kluge</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>, owner of media giant <ORGANIZATION>Metromedia Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, valued at <MONEY>$7.0
billion</MONEY>; ninth was <PERSON>Tsai Wan-lin</PERSON> and family of <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>, owners of a
construction and insurance empire worth <MONEY>$6.5 billion</MONEY>; 10th was the
<ORGANIZATION>Thomson</ORGANIZATION> family, owners of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s biggest newspaper chain, at <MONEY>$6.2
billion</MONEY>.
   American newcomers included the <PERSON>Stephens</PERSON> family of <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>,
owners of investment banking, energy and real estate holdings worth
<MONEY>$1.7 billion</MONEY>; the <PERSON>Parfet</PERSON> family of <LOCATION>Kalamazoo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, owners of a
large stake in the <ORGANIZATION>Upjohn Co.</ORGANIZATION> drugmaker, worth <MONEY>$1.5 billion</MONEY>; and
<PERSON>Philip Knight</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>Nike Inc.</ORGANIZATION> athletic footwear maker, <MONEY>$1.3
billion</MONEY>.
   Foreign newcomers included <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON> and <PERSON>Esther Koplovitz</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>,
owners of a <MONEY>$2.2 billion</MONEY> construction and banking fortune; <PERSON>Hiroshi
Termachi</PERSON>, owner of a <MONEY>$1.8 billion</MONEY> Japanese ball bearing business;
and <PERSON>John Spyros Latsis</PERSON>, European head of a Saudi Arabian shipping
and oil-refinery network worth <MONEY>$1.8 billion</MONEY>.
   The magazine based estimates of net worth on what it called
``published information or appraisals of asset values.'' To
qualify, each prospect needed a net worth of <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> or more
after subtracting debt.
   Fortune said the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> remained home to the greatest
number of billionaires at 58. Twenty were from the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION>, 15
from <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, nine from <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, and eight in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, down from
12 last year.

<HEAD>Queen Tops List of Britain's Wealthiest 200</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth II</PERSON>, whose personal fortune is a
closely guarded secret, is <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s richest person worth an
estimated <MONEY>$5.87 billion</MONEY>, according to a list of the nation's 200
richest people.
   The list was front-page news in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, with racy
tabloid headlines ranging from ``Filthy Rich'' in the Sun to
``Millionaires Galore'' in the Daily Mail.
   Money Magazine, which complied the list, said the
second-wealthiest Briton as 92-year-old Sir <PERSON>John Moores</PERSON>, founder of
the <ORGANIZATION>Littlewoods</ORGANIZATION> soccer pools empire, a weekly game for small-time
gamblers based on soccer results. It estimated his fortune at <MONEY>$2.99
billion</MONEY>.
   It listed the third-wealthiest Briton as supermarket chain owner
<PERSON>Garfield Weston</PERSON>, 60, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Associated British Foods</ORGANIZATION>, with an
estimated personal fortune at <MONEY>$2.64 billion</MONEY>.
   In fourth place is the 36-year-old <ORGANIZATION>Duke of Westminster</ORGANIZATION>. His
inherited holdings include large chunks of highly desireable real
estate in central <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, huge tracts of farmland and sweeping
acres of remote northern moorland. The magazine said his personal
fortune was about <MONEY>$2.46 billion</MONEY>.
   Money Magazine says <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> has seven billionaires, 18 families
and individuals worth more than <MONEY>$440 million</MONEY> each, and 20,000
millionaires as measured in pounds.
   The magazine's estimate of the 61-year-old queen's wealth makes
her the world's eighth-richest individual. It said the world's
richest person is the Sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, with an estimated fortune
equivalent to <MONEY>$24.64 billion</MONEY>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Guinness Book of Records</ORGANIZATION> lists the richest person in the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> as <PERSON>Sam Moore Walton</PERSON>, founder of <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> discount
stores in <LOCATION>Bentonville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ark.</LOCATION>, whose personal wealth was estimated in
mid-1987 at <MONEY>$4.5 billion</MONEY> ``and rising.''
   Money Magazine said financier Sir <PERSON>James Goldsmith</PERSON> _ fifth in its
list of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s wealthiest 200 with an estimated <MONEY>$1.76 billion</MONEY> _
was the only British billionaire to have made all his money since
the end of World War II in <DATE>1945</DATE>.
   The youngest person in the top 200 is 31-year-old <PERSON>Sophie Mirman</PERSON>,
with an estimated <MONEY>$52.8 million</MONEY>. She and her husband, <PERSON>Richard Ross</PERSON>,
created the popular Sock Shop chain.
   Among the 12 women in the top 200 list are ``Dynasty'' star <PERSON>Joan
Collins</PERSON> and her sister, <PERSON>Jackie Collins</PERSON>, the author of a string of
best-selling raunchy novels. It said they are worth an estimated
<MONEY>$26.4 million</MONEY> between them.
   Editor Sue <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said it took six months to compile the list,
``consulting public sources of information and talking extensively
to analysts in the <LOCATION>City</LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s financial district.
   ``The people we did not talk to were the 200 themselves because
we wanted to keep the list under wraps until the last possible
minute. Many of the super-rich are very secretive,'' she said.
   Asked how it estimated the queen's wealth in view of the secrecy
maintained by her <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> bankers, <ORGANIZATION>Coutts and Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mrs. Thomas</PERSON> said:
``We found out as much as we could about the different headings
under which her wealth falls _ her castles and other properties,
her land holdings, her vast share portfolio, her stamp collection,
her art collection, her jewelry collection and so forth and we
talked to a lot of people with information.
   ``We arrived at what we estimate to be a minimum net worth for
all the people on our list.''
   It said 53 of the 200 fortunes stemmed from property. Five
percent of those listed came from abroad and only <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> belong
to the British aristocracy. The self-made rich outnumbered those
who inherited their wealth by 2-1.

'ROYAL WATCHER' KEEPS TABS ON ALL THE WINDSOR RICHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARRY ABRAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Queen of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> is worth well over 2,000 times her weight in gold. 
</P>
<P>
Roughly. 
</P>
<P>
In mere money, the 126-pound monarch, almost certainly the world's richest 
woman at any weight, possesses somewhere between <MONEY>$1.72 billion</MONEY> and <MONEY>$2.04 
billion</MONEY>. And -- here's the good part -- it's all tax free. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a good chunk of the royal private fortune derives from gifts, some 
dating back to the days of <PERSON>Queen Victoria</PERSON>, of jewels, land and hefty sums of 
cash from maharajahs, sheiks, sultans and subjects who show no signs of turning 
off the tap to the sovereign -- or her family. 
</P>
<P>
These estimates are made by <PERSON>Andrew Morton</PERSON>, professional "royal watcher," who 
traced the British royal family's private holdings -- in precious gems, 
estates, art, investments, race horses, automobiles, even a stamp collection -- 
to come up with what he claims is the best guess yet of how rich the royal 
family really is. 
</P>
<P>
Of course estimates of the royal riches are cranked out regularly, in what 
amounts to a mini-industry. Last <DATE>September</DATE>, Fortune magazine put the queen's 
worth at <MONEY>$10.9 billion</MONEY>. Other estimates have varied wildly over the years from 
a few paltry millions to as much as <MONEY>$26 billion</MONEY>, all of which <PERSON>Morton</PERSON> maintains 
are skewed by questionable motive or bad information. 
</P>
<P>
"There is this huge wall of secrecy surrounding anything to do with the royal 
family," <PERSON>Morton</PERSON> said in an interview in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. "Everybody thinks they 
know everything about the Windsors. They know nothing. The often used image is 
that the Windsors live in a goldfish bowl. If it's a goldfish bowl, it's one 
that's been blacked out." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Morton</PERSON> has laid out his stalking of the royal finances in a new book published 
simultaneously here and in <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION>, where it was excerpted in a national 
newspaper and is due to be serialized in other publications. 
</P>
<P>
"Theirs Is the Kingdom: The Wealth of the British Royal Family" is studded with 
the usual royal tidbits: a Canadian air force jet being dispatched to return 
Prince <PERSON>Charles</PERSON>' "beloved" crocodile shoehorn left behind on a visit to 
<LOCATION>Winnipeg</LOCATION>, the queen diverting her yacht so that she could mail a letter, for 
instance. 
</P>
<P>
But the core of the book is a cold-eyed banker's assessment of the origins and 
disposition of the private wealth that supports the <ORGANIZATION>House of Windsor</ORGANIZATION>. One 
chapter traces the development of the family's finances from Queen <PERSON>Victoria</PERSON> to 
the present, including deductions based on the limited evidence available about 
the current queen's stock portfolio, apparently brimming with mining and 
electronic issues and estimated to be worth <MONEY>$595 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$680 million</MONEY> by 
<PERSON>Morton</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"I hired somebody for two months who was a proper stocks and shares expert to 
look into this thing because their (the royal family's) stocks and shares are 
disguised by something called the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of England</ORGANIZATION> nominee accounts, which were 
set up by the government in order specifically to shield the queen's 
investments from investigation," <PERSON>Morton</PERSON> explained. 
</P>
<P>
The book's appendix includes an inventory of "known" royal jewels, estimates of 
land values and income from estates and other holdings, including a shopping 
center. 
</P>
<P>
The inventory of Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON>'s private jewelry -- as opposed to the crown 
jewels and other property held in public trust -- includes a tiara last seen in 
public in <DATE>1911</DATE> with an estimated value of <MONEY>$600,000</MONEY> and a 94.4-carat diamond 
valued at <MONEY>$9.5 million</MONEY>. The assessment made for <PERSON>Morton</PERSON> puts the total value of 
the diamonds, emeralds, rubies, pearls and sapphires at <MONEY>$60.6 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$71 
million</MONEY>. It is a conservative estimate and does not include the market value -- 
up to 10 times or more of assessed worth -- that would be added because of 
their royal ownership, according to <PERSON>Morton</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
During his investigation, <PERSON>Morton</PERSON> said he bumped into a lot of obstacles -- laws 
that shroud royal investments in secrecy, uncooperative sources close to the 
royal family and the family's own fierce protection of its privacy. For 
example, since the time of Queen <PERSON>Victoria</PERSON>, royal financial advisers have taken 
"the secrets that they have to the grave," he said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Morton</PERSON> is the author of seven books about the royal family, a former newspaper 
correspondent who covered the royal beat and now proprietor of <ORGANIZATION>Palace Press</ORGANIZATION>, an 
independent news agency specializing in news and features about the royal 
family. But even for him, <PERSON>Morton</PERSON> admitted, much of royal life is unknown 
territory. Not only that, but the royals are protected by a "global myth 
machine" that further obscures the difference between royal image and reality, 
<PERSON>Morton</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"The royal family, like the best actors, put on a very good display for the 
public but in private they are very different people," he continued. "They're 
not everything that the public thinks. For example, the royal family today 
lives very much the way Queen <PERSON>Victoria</PERSON> did. Prince <PERSON>Charles</PERSON>, this man who is 
described as 'everyman, the crusading prince,' still goes grouse shooting with 
kings, dines with billionaires and millionaires in exactly the same way that 
<PERSON>Edward VII</PERSON> did a hundred years ago." 
</P>
<P>
One instance of royal obfuscation occurred in <DATE>1986</DATE> when a sapphire and diamond 
ensemble was omitted from the list of official gifts made to the Prince and 
Princess of <LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION> by the Sultan of <LOCATION>Oman</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Morton</PERSON> said. The ensemble, estimated 
to be worth <MONEY>$1.7 million</MONEY> and designated as a private gift, was only admitted to 
exist a year later when the Princess happened to wear them in public, he added. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Morton</PERSON> theorized that this royal reluctance "rightly shows the embarrassment 
they feel" about receiving such lavish gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Like the monarchy itself, the giving of gifts to the royal family is an 
enduring anachronism, <PERSON>Morton</PERSON> said. "I find the psychological and sociological 
aspects of it just fascinating," he said. "Why give to the richest woman in the 
world? . . . In a sense it shows that we're not really that far off from 
primitive tribes, that we live in a global village and that we still look to 
the equivalent of the squire on the hill." 
</P>
<P>
Morton contends, however, that the royal family will not always be able to 
protect its private wealth and enjoy unique privileges. 
</P>
<P>
In his book he notes, "The Windsors have shrewdly used the shield of their 
public duties to construct an armor of legal concessions, ranging from their 
wills to their shares, to deflect the arrows of outrageous inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a question of fine judgment for the royal family -- and ultimately 
Parliament -- about how long their legal and tax advantages, secured by dint of 
their public role, can coexist alongside their increasingly vocal demands to be 
left a lone and treated as ordinary people. Ironically the very success of the 
<LOCATION>Windsor</LOCATION> dynasty may prove to be its undoing."

<HEAD>Magazine Says Mars Candy Bar Family Richest in America</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release 6 p.m. EDT</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Mars candy-bar clan is worth <MONEY>$12.5 billion</MONEY>,
surpassing the <ORGANIZATION>Newhouse</ORGANIZATION> publishing dynasty as the richest family in
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, Fortune magazine reports.
   If Fortune's estimate is correct, the worth of the Marses could
buy about 25 billion regular-size Snickers bars, which if laid end
to end would circle the planet Mars nearly 32 times.
   The magazine's calculation is more than any previous estimate of
the wealth of the secretive family, which shuns publicity about
itself and its candy bar company, maker of Snickers and M&amp;Ms.
   ``Mars's assets are often underestimated because the company is
as loose with information as its McLean, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, neighbor, the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION>,''
<PERSON>Fortune</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> in an advance press release about its <DATE>1988</DATE>
Billionaires List, to be carried in the <DATE>Sept. 12</DATE> issue available on
newsstands next <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   The magazine said it based the estimate of the Marses' wealth on
what comparable food concerns have sold for recently.
   ``Thus, <ORGANIZATION>Forrest Mars</ORGANIZATION> and his three children, <PERSON>Forrest Jr.</PERSON>, <PERSON>John
and Jacqueline</PERSON>, overtake the <PERSON>Newhouse</PERSON> publishing magnates as the
richest Americans,'' Fortune said.
   Still, the Marses rank No. 3 on Fortune's worldwide list. The
richest remains the Sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, whose oil wealth makes him
worth <MONEY>$25 billion</MONEY>. Next is King Fahd of <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION> and family,
worth <MONEY>$18 billion</MONEY>.
   Fourth is <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s Queen Elizabeth II with <MONEY>$8.7 billion</MONEY>; next
is the <LOCATION>Newhouses</LOCATION>, whose communications holdings are worth <MONEY>$8
billion</MONEY>; in sixth place is retail king <PERSON>Sam Walton</PERSON>, founder of
<ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> stores, and family, worth <MONEY>$7.4 billion</MONEY>; seventh is
<LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Reichmann</PERSON> family, with <MONEY>$6.3 billion</MONEY> in assets that range
from swank <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> real estate to interests in railroads and
utilities.
   Eighth is <PERSON>Kenneth Irving</PERSON> and family, a Canadian clan that owns
400 companies worth <MONEY>$6.2 billion</MONEY>; ninth is <PERSON>Kenneth Thomson</PERSON> and
family, Canadian owners of a publishing, retailing, energy and real
estate empire worth <MONEY>$6 billion</MONEY>; and in 10th place is <PERSON>Gerald
Grosvenor</PERSON> and family, British land barons worth <MONEY>$5.4 billion</MONEY>.
   Of the 129 individuals and nuclear families that comprise this
year's list, there are 51 in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, 38 in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, 19 in
<LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> _ including 12 Japanese _ 13 Arabs and eight others, Fortune
said.

<LEADPARA>  Is she or isn't she the world's richest woman? And should she or shouldn't she
pay taxes on her income, just like everyone else? Those brash questions about
Queen Elizabeth II were raised in Parliament this week by Liberal Party Member
of Parliament Simon Hughes, in a move that reflected the opinion of a majority
of citizens.;    More than 70 percent of the British, polls show, believe her
income should be subject to taxes. Or as Hughes put it, "When so many people
in my (London) constituency are scraping along and asked to contribute tax on
very low incomes, it seems grossly unfair that the person with the highest
income escapes. And there's no reason a modern constitutional monarch
shouldn't pay taxes."  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  COUNTING QUEEN ELIZABETH'S MILLIONS
ESTIMATES PLACE MONARCH'S WEALTH AT $7.4
BILLION  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The queen's personal net worth has long been a matter of considerable
speculation and argument, since, unlike <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> heads of state, she is not
required to make public the amount of her wealth and she has not volunteered
the information. Estimates range on the high side -- Fortune magazine
estimates it at <MONEY>$7.4 billion</MONEY>, with an annual income of perhaps <MONEY>$3 million</MONEY> a
day; <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> snorts that such a sum is "grossly exaggerated." There
also is a more modest estimate that her income is <MONEY>$35 million</MONEY> annually.;   
Over the years, researchers have tried to estimate the queen's personal
capital and income. Those assets are different from the institutions of the
monarchy, including the crown jewels in the Tower of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and the official
residences of <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Castle</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Windsor Castle</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Holyrood Castle.</ORGANIZATION>;    As
far as current official income goes, she receives from the British government
-- in what is called the Civil List -- 7.9 million pounds, or about <MONEY>$12.5
million</MONEY>. That sum is much more than her royal household expenses, giving her a
comfortable surplus this year. (Her employees, incidentally, pay taxes on
their salaries.);    But the queen has other major resources: Whatever money
she inherited from her father, <PERSON>King George VI</PERSON>; a vault full of precious jewels
-- crowns, tiaras, diamonds, rubies, emeralds; <ORGANIZATION>Faberge</ORGANIZATION> eggs; and the royal art
collection with 900 <PERSON>Leonardo Da Vinci</PERSON> drawings, 26 Van Dycks and works by
other masters. There is also one of the world's most valuable stamp
collections.;    Further, she owns hundreds of thousands of prime agricultural
acres, as well as valuable property in central <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. Then there are <LOCATION>Balmoral</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Sandringham</LOCATION> castles with 64,000 acres between them. Not to be forgotten
are the royal stud farms and stables.;    The queen's major source of income
may be her private investments, which have accrued tax-free over a long
period. In <DATE>1971</DATE>, to quiet speculation, the palace let it be known that her
investment portfolio in stock shares did not exceed 50 million pounds.;   
Taking an even lower figure of 35 million pounds, <PERSON>Andrew Morton</PERSON>, author of
"Theirs Is the Kingdom: The Wealth of the Windsors," consulted experts who
estimated that, if reasonably wisely invested, the portfolio would be worth
600 million pounds today. He estimates the queen's personal wealth at <MONEY>1.2
billion pounds</MONEY>.  </TEXT>

   Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth II</PERSON>, believed to be the world's
richest woman, grumbles about the price she has to pay for her
clothes and is happier wearing a pair of comfortable old shoes,
according to her favorite couturier.
   Sir <PERSON>Hardy Amies</PERSON> says in the <DATE>May 23</DATE> issue of the Woman's Own
weekly that the queen is not a ``clothes person.''
   The designer, who will be 81 in <DATE>July</DATE>, is Dressmaker by
Appointment to Her Majesty the Queen, a title granted by <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham
Palace</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``She grumbles about our prices, drops hints and things, but she
has been told ... that those are the prices,'' <PERSON>Amies</PERSON> said.
   He said the queen often ignores his advice.
   ``She doesn't care, basically. She listens to our advice, then
goes off and wears shabby shoes because they're comfortable.
   ``In my opinion that is perfectly all right. It's only the hoi
polloi who criticize,'' he said.
   Princess <PERSON>Anne</PERSON>, the queen's daughter, ``won't pay our prices and
she's happy with the way she dresses,'' said Amies.

   A Japanese developer again topped a list of the
world's richest people, but the annual tally has one conspicuous
deletion this year: <PERSON>Donald J. Trump</PERSON>.
   Despite the financial troubles of the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> developer, the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> continues to contain the world's largest number of
billionaires _ 62 _ according to estimates by Forbes magazine. In
addition, there are 37 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> families with fortunes over <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>,
<ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION> says in its <DATE>July 23</DATE> issue.
   Forbes, in estimates released <DATE>Monday</DATE>, says the world's
wealthiest person for the fourth straight year was <PERSON>Yoshiaki
Tsutsumi</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, whose railroad and real estate empire includes
golf courses, ski resorts and hotels. Forbes estimated his net
worth at <MONEY>$16 billion</MONEY>, up about <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> from last year.
   That estimate was far greater than that of rival business
magazine Fortune, which put Tsutsumi's net worth at <MONEY>$3.1 billion</MONEY>
last <DATE>September</DATE>.
   Fortune said the world's richest person is the Sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>,
at <MONEY>$25 billion</MONEY>. Forbes excludes heads of state from consideration.
   Following the 56-year-old <PERSON>Tsutsumi</PERSON> on the Forbes list was
Japanese developer <PERSON>Taikichiro Mori</PERSON>, a former economics professor
who now owns 78 office buildings. Forbes put Mori's net worth at
<MONEY>$14.6 billion</MONEY>.
   Ranked third was the family of <PERSON>Sam Walton</PERSON>, founder of <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION>,
the third-largest <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>retail chain. Forbes estimates that the
Waltons, who also were third-ranked last year, are worth <MONEY>$13.3
billion</MONEY>, up from <MONEY>$8.7 billion</MONEY> in <DATE>1989</DATE>.
   America's du <PERSON>Pont</PERSON> family was fourth, with a net worth estimated
at <MONEY>$10 billion</MONEY>. They were followed by <PERSON>Hans</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gad Rausing</PERSON>, two
Swedish brothers who control a packaging empire worth <MONEY>$9.6 billion</MONEY>.
   <PERSON>Kitaro Watanabe</PERSON>, a Japanese real estate owner, was sixth at <MONEY>$9.2
billion</MONEY>. He was followed by <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Reichmann</PERSON> brothers, owners of
the <ORGANIZATION>Olympia &amp; York</ORGANIZATION> real estate company, at <MONEY>$9 billion</MONEY>.
   <PERSON>Kenkichi Nakajima</PERSON> and his family, founder of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s largest
maker of pachinko machines, a gambling game similar to pinball,
were eighth at <MONEY>$8.4 billion</MONEY>.
   <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Shin Kyuk-ho</PERSON>, who owns a candy and real estate
empire, was ninth at <MONEY>$7 billion</MONEY> to <MONEY>$8 billion</MONEY>; and <PERSON>Forrest E. Mars</PERSON>
and family of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, of Mars candy fame, were 10th at
an estimated <MONEY>$6 billion</MONEY>.
   Other American families with net worth exceeding <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY>
included the <ORGANIZATION>Newhouse</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Hearst</ORGANIZATION> and Cox families, which derive their
fortunes from publishing and broadcasting; the Bass family of
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>; the <PERSON>Mellon</PERSON> family of banking fame; the <PERSON>Dorrance</PERSON> family,
whose wealth comes from <ORGANIZATION>Campbell Soup Co.</ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON>Bill Gates</PERSON>, founder
of the computer software company <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>John Werner Kluge</PERSON> remained the richest American individual,
according to <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Kluge</PERSON>, founder of the media company
<ORGANIZATION>Metromedia</ORGANIZATION>, has an estimated net worth of <MONEY>$5.2 billion</MONEY>, placing him
in a tie for 12th place on the worldwide list with the Newhouses.
   As for <ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON> put his net worth last year at <MONEY>$1.7
billion</MONEY>, but it dropped sharply this year as the value of his real
estate and airline empire plummeted. In <DATE>April</DATE>, the magazine said he
was worth about a half <MONEY>a billion dollars</MONEY>. Some sources peg it even
lower.
   Forbes says one trend it noticed in compiling this year's list
was the number of wealthy Germans. The magazine identified 38 West
German billionaire families _ far more per capita than in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> or
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   The list includes 40 Japanese and 99 American individuals or
families with a net worth over <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>.
   Forbes says it identified 271 billionaire individuals or
families worldwide, up from 226 last year. The compilation is based
on recent stock valuations, comparable real estate valuations and
currency exchange rates, among other factors.
   The magazine says it excludes from consideration royal families
and heads of state because their wealth ``derives more from
political heritage than from economic effort.''
   But it doesn't exclude drug dealers. Among the billionaires it
lists are <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Pablo Escobar Gaviria</PERSON>, the head of the
<LOCATION>Medellin</LOCATION> cocaine cartel, at about <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY>, and <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Ochoa</PERSON>
family, at about <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY>.

Born in <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION> to Italian parents and educated in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Gabriella De 
Ferrari</PERSON> has written her first novel in her third language. Though trained as a 
diplomat, she became director of <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>'s Museum of Contemporary Art, then 
curator of the renowned <ORGANIZATION>Fogg Museum</ORGANIZATION>. All three national cultures and both 
professional disciplines figure significantly in "A Cloud on Sand," which 
begins in a small Italian coastal village, moves on to a provincial South 
American city with a sizeable Italian population, and is suffused throughout 
with an artistic sensibility to landscape, color and form. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the book is written in the English taught to an adult instead of 
the language naturally acquired by a child lends the prose a formal and 
somewhat dated quality perfectly suited to a story set abroad in the period 
from <DATE>1920</DATE> to the end of World War II. There's a lushness here, a sense of 
hyper-reality and an expansiveness of character that contrasts strongly with 
our contemporary home-grown pragmatism. The frame of reference is never taken 
for granted, but generously supplied by a variety of sensory images, so that 
the reader not only visualizes the exotic settings, but perceives the 
particular sounds, tastes and textures. At first the structure seems somewhat 
arbitrary and obscure. A woman named <PERSON>Marta</PERSON>, unidentified until the end of the 
novel, is asking questions of <LOCATION>Antonia</LOCATION>, eliciting the detailed answers that 
become the novel proper. After a brief prologue that takes place on a ship 
leaving <PERSON>Buenos Aires</PERSON> for the fictional town of <LOCATION>Pica</LOCATION>, in the country of Yayaku 
adjoining <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>, we're transported back to <LOCATION>Antonia</LOCATION>'s girlhood in a small 
fishing village on the Italian Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
The time is the <DATE>1930s</DATE>, and <LOCATION>Artemisia</LOCATION> is generally by-passed by foreign 
travelers eager to get from <LOCATION>Genoa</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Florence</LOCATION>. Artemisia has few attractions, 
though it does boast a grand white stone villa set squarely in the midst of the 
crumbling medieval streets. This is <LOCATION>Antonia</LOCATION>'s home, built as her father's 
capitulation to the wishes of her mother, <PERSON>Dora</PERSON>. After their wedding, <PERSON>Antonia</PERSON>'s 
father had taken his capricious peasant bride to <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, where he was one of 
the newly prosperous Italian settlers. After one look at <ORGANIZATION>Buenos Aires</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Dora</PERSON> 
refused to disembark, returning to <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> on the boat that brought her. Bowing 
to her indomitable will, her husband built the grand villa in <LOCATION>Artemisia</LOCATION>, 
visiting his family twice a year. In his long absences, <PERSON>Dora</PERSON> conducted herself 
as a single woman, taking a succession of casual lovers but soon settling upon 
the gentle and devoted Count <PERSON>Mora</PERSON>. He would be her protector for the rest of 
her days, acting in loco parentis for <PERSON>Antonia</PERSON> and her brother <PERSON>Marco</PERSON>, mitigating 
Dora's often baleful influence upon the children. 
</P>
<P>
In turn, <PERSON>Antonia</PERSON> falls in love and marries an Italian businessman living in 
<LOCATION>Yayaku</LOCATION>. Her character strengthened by the count's lofty ethical principles, 
<PERSON>Antonia</PERSON> remains in the remote outpost in which she finds herself, though she is 
still enough her mother's daughter to insist on living according to her own 
instincts and desires, not caring if she outrages Pica's tightly-knit and 
conservative Italian community. She becomes a strong and capable woman, a wife 
perhaps more adored than adoring, but essentially content with her 
extraordinary existence. 
</P>
<P>
De <ORGANIZATION>Ferrari</ORGANIZATION> gives us a spacious gallery of domestic interiors and landscape 
studies, re-creating the curious atmosphere of a European colony two continents 
away from its source; trapped in a time warp even more alienating than mere 
geographical distance. Against these rich, dense backgrounds, her characters 
grow in strength and vitality, welcoming us into a mysterious, vanished world.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- The Gallery:
   MoMA Gets Former CBS CEO's Art Trove
   ----

<LP>
   New York -- The late William S. Paley, founder and
longtime chairman of CBS, was widely considered to be about
as tough as they come. But he was also an enthusiastic
collector of modern paintings and an avid supporter of the
Museum of Modern Art -- and in those areas of his life he
seems to have given rein to his gentler and more generous
impulses. "The William S. Paley Collection," in which the
more than 80 works that he recently bequeathed to MoMA are
being shown together publicly for the first time, provides a
double reason for celebration.
   The first reason is that this extraordinary collection
contains a number of important and beautiful works that will
complement and fill out the museum's own permanent collection
in significant ways. The second is that Mr. Paley had the
generosity, good sense and good taste to allow the museum to
display his collection as it sees fit. Unlike a number of
other major collectors, who insist that their collections be
exhibited intact regardless of the best interests of the
institutions that receive them, and who even bargain with
museums on that basis, Mr. Paley made his bequest with no
strings attached. This kind of generosity reaffirms the
viability of MoMA's admirable policy of not dividing its
permanent collections into little monuments to big egos, by
refusing to accept collections that come with the proviso
that they must be displayed separately forever and for all
time.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But then again, <PERSON>Mr. Paley</PERSON> was a very particular kind of
collector who had a very special relationship to <ORGANIZATION>MoMA</ORGANIZATION>. He
became a trustee of the museum in <DATE>1937</DATE>, when it was only
eight years old, and he served on its board for many years
before he went on to become president in <DATE>1968</DATE>, and eventually
chairman, during the museum's crucial years of expansion
between <DATE>1972</DATE> and <DATE>1985</DATE>. When he died in <DATE>1990</DATE>, he was chairman
emeritus.
   Moreover, although he put together an exceptional
collection, <PERSON>Mr. Paley</PERSON> was not a collector in the usual sense.
He began to buy modern pictures in <DATE>1935</DATE>, at a time when doing
so was not particularly fashionable, and he bought them by
following his own tastes and enthusiasms rather than by
pursuing some ideal "wellrounded" or "comprehensive"
collection. He once stated his rule of thumb for collecting
as "Don't buy it unless you can't live without it." And
indeed, most of the pictures in his collection seem to
reflect the more passionate preoccupations of the man who
acquired them. They tend to be richly painted and rather
intimate in scale and feeling-contemplative rather than
dramatic, and sensuous rather than showy. In the fullest
sense, his collection was part of his private, rather than
his public life. He shunned publicity related to it, was
reluctant to lend works from it, and got most of his ego
gratification in places other than the art world.
   <PERSON>William Rubin</PERSON>, director emeritus of <ORGANIZATION>MoMA's Department of
Painting</ORGANIZATION> and Sculpture, has installed the <PERSON>Paley</PERSON> collection
with great sensitivity to its particular strengths. The works
are thoughtfully arranged in a setting that is at once
spacious but intimate, and that is as attentive to the rich
physical presence of the pictures as to the ideas and
historical lessons implicit in them. As a result, little gems
like <ORGANIZATION>Renoir</ORGANIZATION>'s delightful "Strawberries" or Manet's tiny but
electric rendering of "Two Roses on a Tablecloth" come across
as vividly as the larger and historically more important
pictures, such as <PERSON>Derain</PERSON>'s brilliantly colored "Bridge Over
the Riou" of <DATE>1906</DATE>, which is a significant addition to the
museum's fauve collection.
   The tone of the exhibition is nicely set by the first work
you see, <PERSON>Gauguin</PERSON>'s beautifully painted "The Seed of the
Areoi." In it, a nude Tahitian woman holds in her hand a
flowering seed, a potent symbol of her own sensuality and
procreative force, which is further reinforced by the
resonant colors and rich visual textures of the picture as a
whole. As in many other paintings in the show, the
wonderfully fresh surface offers a further delight to the
eye. Similarly, the haunting poetry of <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>'s famous "Boy
Leading a Horse" of 1905-06 is wonderfully intensified by its
matte surface, which emphasizes the picture's seductive
combination of austere idealization and insistent
physicality. In <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>'s lessknown but almost equally
impressive "Nude With Joined Hands" of <DATE>1906</DATE>, the fresh,
shimmering pinks of the background envelop the woman's body
in an incandescent glow.
   Both <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Matisse</ORGANIZATION> considered Cezanne to be a god of
painting, and the master of <LOCATION>Aix</LOCATION> might well be considered
MoMA's household deity. It is thus especially gratifying to
see the museum finally acquire a self-portrait by <ORGANIZATION>Cezanne</ORGANIZATION>,
bearded and sporting a rather jaunty straw hat. The museum's
already fine Cezanne collection will also be markedly
enhanced by the addition of a grand and richly painted
L'Estaque landscape and of a powerfully composed and
vigorously painted still life.
   Although MoMA has one of the best <ORGANIZATION>Matisse</ORGANIZATION> collections in
the world, it has been surprisingly weak in works from the
socalled Nice Period, from <DATE>1918</DATE> to <DATE>1930</DATE>. The <PERSON>Paley</PERSON> collection
includes four Matisses from this period. A small <DATE>1918</DATE>
landscape, which has the freshness of a colored drawing, and
a charming little <DATE>1923</DATE> "Woman With Anemones" are fairly
typical of <ORGANIZATION>Matisse</ORGANIZATION>'s somewhat low-key work during this
period. But the two others are among the most impressive
pictures <PERSON>Matisse</PERSON> did during the <DATE>1920s</DATE>. The vibrant "Odalisque
With a Tambourine" of <DATE>1926</DATE> is painted with an extraordinary
combination of virtuosity and abandon, while the enigmatic
"Woman With a Veil" of <DATE>1927</DATE> combines the ambition and
pictorial complexity of <ORGANIZATION>Matisse</ORGANIZATION>'s earlier, more abstract
works with the directness and sensuality that he cultivated
at Nice.
   From such heights, <PERSON>Mr. Paley</PERSON>'s collecting trailed off
after World War II, and his holdings in more recent American
art are distinctly less significant than those in earlier
French art. Nonetheless, there are some pleasant surprises.
Chief among these is the unexpectedly painterly "Homage to
the Square in Green Frame" by <PERSON>Joseph Albers</PERSON>, which is one of
that rather chilly artist's least impersonal works. Even in
the cool world of geometrical abstraction, <PERSON>Mr. Paley</PERSON> was able
to find at least a tremor of sensuality.
   "The <PERSON>William S. Paley</PERSON> Collection" is accompanied by a
thorough and informative catalog written by <PERSON>William Rubin</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Matthew Armstrong</PERSON>. The exhibition will be on view at <ORGANIZATION>MoMA</ORGANIZATION>
through <DATE>April 7</DATE>. After that, it will travel to <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>
before it returns to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> to be integrated into the
museum's permanent collections in the <DATE>spring of 1994</DATE>.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Brazil - the beautiful and the damned /
Christina Lamb describes trillionaire life in the country with the biggest
gap between rich and poor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<LOCATION>BRAZIL</LOCATION> is perhaps the only country in the world where the entire working
populace are millionaires. Unfortunately, most are also poor. With a million
cruzeiros now worth Dollars 25, to be seriously rich in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> one must have
a good few trillion stashed away.
And plenty such people exist. Forget the <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> of economic crises, growing
slums, ailing Indians and Dollars 2,000 per capita income. Instead, welcome
to the country which is second only to the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> in purchase of private jets
and where high society is so flourishing that the <ORGANIZATION>Association of Columnists</ORGANIZATION>
boasts more than 500 working members and even the <ORGANIZATION>Journal of Commerce</ORGANIZATION> has a
large gossip column.
Wealth is flaunted. At one favourite hangout, <LOCATION>Leopoldos</LOCATION>, in <LOCATION>Sao Paulo</LOCATION>,
diners watch images of themselves and other customers projected on to a
giant videoscreen, enabling close scrutiny of who is wearing what and
flirting with whom. In tropical Rio, fur wraps are de rigueur for true
socialites.
These are the authentic beautiful and the damned. 'Beautiful' because in the
world capital of plastic surgery, nobody with money is allowed to retain
nature's imperfections. Nose jobs, face lifts, bottom tucks, cellulite
removal, breast implants - the decision is not if but when the next cut
should come. <PERSON>Ivo Pitanguy</PERSON> is <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s high priest of plastic surgery;
fittingly, he has become a member of the serious rich himself, owning an
island south of Rio.
'Damned' because <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> has the world's biggest income gap between rich and
poor - a contrast particularly obvious in <LOCATION>Rio</LOCATION>, where luxury apartments rub
shoulders with sprawling slums. Already the crime rate is so high that even
the only-slightly-rich live behind bars protected by armies of security
guards and drive bullet-proof cars. Sometimes, sipping cocktails on their
penthouse terraces, rich Brazilians look at the lights of the surrounding
slums and wonder how long before the masses swarm upon them, demanding
justice.
Meantime, they are having a ball. 'The Brazilian elite are like a bunch of
people having a wild champagne party on a boat which is heading towards the
edge of <ORGANIZATION>Niagara Falls</ORGANIZATION>,' says a World Bank official.
The day starts late for <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s seriously rich. For the women it begins
with exercises or a jog along the beach, followed by a light lunch at a
restaurant such as Antiquarius to discuss the events of the previous night.
Then it is a trip to the hair salon, perhaps tea at the <LOCATION>Copacabana Palace</LOCATION>,
then home to prepare for a party or dinner at one of Rio's classy French
restaurants - Le <ORGANIZATION>Bec</ORGANIZATION> Fin, <PERSON>Claude Troisgros</PERSON> or Le Meridien. For the younger
set, preferred hangouts are Banana cafe or Gattopardos, followed by dancing
at Hippopotamus.
Weekends are spent messing about on boats, jetskis and microlites in the
coastal resorts of <LOCATION>Angra</LOCATION> dos <PERSON>Reis</PERSON> or <LOCATION>Buzios</LOCATION>, or horse-riding in the
mountains of <LOCATION>Petropolis</LOCATION>. There are also frequent trips to the requisite
fazenda in the country, and to <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> where rich
Brazilians descend on fashion houses like <ORGANIZATION>Chanel</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Balenciaga</ORGANIZATION>, practising
the French that it is so chic to speak at home.
Although <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s security problems have caused a few of the rich to flee
permanently, most return. According to <PERSON>Jeff Thomas</PERSON>, a leading society
writer: 'They love to see their names in the papers; abroad, they are not
celebrities.'
There is nothing like being rich in a developing country. Even the
moderately well-off can maintain armies of servants, including
white-uniformed nannies to walk the baby and handlers to exercise the dog.
And while strict import laws meant that, until recently, some trappings of
wealth, such as cell phones and smart cars, were unobtainable, even for the
richest, they could still live like kings.
Behind the high brick walls surrounding the estate of 'Baby' <PERSON>Monteiro de
Carvalho</PERSON>, one of Rio's most favoured sons, you encounter mansion after
mansion (one for each of his children) on the long drive until finally
reaching the colonnaded main house, which is like something out of a de
Mille movie.
Brazilian governments have seemed exclusively interested in improving the
lot of the rich, preferring to spend money on subsidies and incentives for
large industry and agriculture rather than social welfare. Monopolies have
been protected, land reform carefully skirted.
The coffee and sugar barons of the past have been replaced by
industrialists, media moguls and bankers, the latter scooping profits from
the soaring inflation rate. Owners of construction companies have also grown
rich from huge development projects at inflated costs which are responsible
for much of the <ORGANIZATION>Third World</ORGANIZATION>'s largest foreign debt.
Proving that crime pays in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, the serious rich also include a fair
number of organised crime bosses, plus corrupt politicians and officials.
Former president <PERSON>Fernando Collor</PERSON> and his frontman, P C <PERSON>Farias</PERSON>, transformed
from a used car salesman to a multi-millionaire, have not let disgrace
interfere with their lifestyles. <PERSON>Orestes Quercia</PERSON>, who recently resigned as
head of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s largest political party, is alleged to have built a fortune
of as much as <ORGANIZATION>Dollars</ORGANIZATION> 1bn during stints as governor of <LOCATION>Sao Paulo</LOCATION>.
In spite of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s social apartheid, the serious rich do not let
themselves be troubled by such things as conscience. You will rarely catch
the rich wives of Rio dirtying their hands in good works. As one society
woman told me: 'The poor are always robbing us, my dear, so why should we
give them money ?'

CHILLING GROUND OF 'SECRET RAPTURE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rapture seems an unlikely term with which to associate the majority of the 
venal, weak, self-centered characters in <PERSON>David Hare</PERSON>'s "The Secret Rapture" at 
<ORGANIZATION>South Coast Repertory</ORGANIZATION>. The word is not used in the scuba diving sense, as in 
rapture of the deep, although spiritual euphoria is part of the mystery Hare 
attempts to evoke. As he explains it, "The 'secret rapture' is that moment at 
which a nun expects to be united with Christ. In other words, it's death." 
</P>
<P>
If that sends a shiver through you, it should. A kind of chill stalks "The 
Secret Rapture" from the moment light slices through blackout as a woman 
nervously opens a door and is startled to find her sister sitting in the dark 
room. Their father has died; his body is on the bed. Lives will be changed, not 
by the event of death, which is only a trigger, but by the forces of 
interpersonal and public politics that will rush in to fill the void. 
</P>
<P>
Hare has not made a secret of his fascination with how larger societal forces 
shape our private ends. He tackled that notion in "Plenty," a psychological 
dissection of post-World War II <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> seen through the collapse of one woman. 
In "Rapture," he has taken the fallout of Thatcherism and created an unlikely 
morality play through the secular canonization of another. 
</P>
<P>
Of the sisters mentioned earlier, <PERSON>Marion</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Bairbre Dowling</ORGANIZATION>) is a junior minister 
in a hidebound conservative government while <PERSON>Isobel</PERSON> (<PERSON>Caroline Goodall</PERSON>) is an 
artist. They have only one thing in common: their late father's widow, 
<PERSON>Katherine</PERSON> (<PERSON>Libby Boone</PERSON>), a much younger woman, alcoholic and incapable of 
coping responsibly. She becomes their unequally shared responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Isobel loves, lives and works with <PERSON>Irwin</PERSON> (<PERSON>Simon Templeman</PERSON>), another artist with 
whom she ekes out a contented living. She is interior, tender, idealistic. 
Marion is exterior, self-righteous and, by her own eventual admission, 
incapable of feeling ("I don't have the right equipment"). She is married to 
<PERSON>Tom</PERSON> (<PERSON>Hal Landon Jr.</PERSON>), a born milquetoast and born-again Baptist who heads 
something called Christians in Business. 
</P>
<P>
The road to destruction is subtle, even if <PERSON>Hare</PERSON>'s play isn't always. First 
<PERSON>Marion</PERSON> allows <PERSON>Katherine</PERSON> to inflict herself on Isobel. Later <PERSON>Marion</PERSON> and <PERSON>Tom</PERSON> in a 
"Christian" desire to "help," bedevil <PERSON>Isobel</PERSON>'s and <PERSON>Irwin</PERSON>'s life with 
self-serving temptations that alter chemistries and wreak ultimate chaos. 
</P>
<P>
The play, which achieves this with uneven success, ends with a tortured 
epiphany that won't bear repeating. "Secret Rapture" is not about plot or 
cause, but about effect. It's about the malice of weakness and the 
powerlessness of strength. It's about currents and resistance, humanity and 
honor. In short, it is dangerous, difficult stuff. After such plays as 
"Speed-the-Plow," "Serious Money," "Glengarry <PERSON>Glen Ross</PERSON>," "Palladium Is Moving" 
and even "Other People's Money," "The Secret Rapture" is, as <PERSON>Hare</PERSON> himself 
recognizes, an attempt "to buck the trend. Unfashionably," says he, "I have a 
heroine." 
</P>
<P>
And then some. Under <PERSON>David Emmes</PERSON>' spare and precise direction, the production 
at <ORGANIZATION>SCR</ORGANIZATION> is a part of <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION>'s ongoing Festival of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>. The design 
team and the cast are a hands-across-the-sea mixer, with the excellent <PERSON>Goodall</PERSON> 
and <PERSON>Templeman</PERSON> hailing from <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, along with set designer <PERSON>Robert Jones</PERSON>, whose 
supply of ever-changing, meticulously detailed locales would seem to defy the 
logistics of storage and wing space. 
</P>
<P>
Boone is a vibrant manic-depressive as <PERSON>Katherine</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Dowling</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Marion</PERSON> is 
shrill and obnoxious enough in her tailored suits to conjure up the inevitable 
associations. <PERSON>Elizabeth Dennehy</PERSON> provides some entertaining man-eating moments 
as her shallow assistant <PERSON>Rhonda</PERSON>, while <PERSON>Landon</PERSON>'s apologetic piety and limpness 
seem a loaded act of perpetual self-erasure. But the play pivots around the 
complex <PERSON>Isobel</PERSON> and, only because he is so inextricably the instrument of her 
fate, around <PERSON>Irwin</PERSON>. Templeman manages to embody weakness with plenty of 
presence, while <PERSON>Goodall</PERSON>'s generous and inviting Isobel thoroughly eludes 
self-pity. 
</P>
<P>
This is a play destined to arouse polemics, but it is curious to recall that it 
did so earlier this year for the wrong reasons, when <PERSON>Hare</PERSON> challenged <ORGANIZATION>New York 
Times</ORGANIZATION> critic <PERSON>Frank Rich</PERSON> to a duel of words after Rich reacted negatively to the 
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> production Hare had directed. Rich declined, but the furor persisted 
-- unfortunately so. The play deserves to be talked about not for its Rich 
review, but for the richness of its content.

<HEAD>Royal Family Gets Pay Increase of 4.6 Percent, Below Inflation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth II</PERSON> and her family got a pay
increase in <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s annual budget of <PERCENT>4.6 percent</PERCENT>, which was lower
than inflation but still means they will cost the taxpayers <MONEY>$10.6
million</MONEY>.
   The increase of 273,000 pounds (<MONEY>$466,800</MONEY>) brought the total to
6,195,300 pounds (<MONEY>$10,594,000</MONEY>), and was too much for some <ORGANIZATION>Labor
Party</ORGANIZATION> legislators whatever its relation to the cost of living.
   ``For the royal family, it looks as though Christmas has come
early,'' Labor member <PERSON>Max Madden</PERSON> said in the <ORGANIZATION>House of Commons</ORGANIZATION>.
   An increase of <PERCENT>4.6 percent</PERCENT> for the Civil List, as the royal
allowances are known, compares with annual inflation of <PERCENT>7.5 percent</PERCENT>,
up from <PERCENT>3.3 percent</PERCENT> a year ago.
   Members of the royal family are paid for carrying out such
official duties as receiving ambassadors, presenting awards, opening
hospitals, visiting the armed forces and making foreign tours.
   Most of the money goes to salaries for the 350 royal household
staff, from private secretaries to coachmen, gardeners and window
cleaners at <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> and the other royal residences.
   Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON>, rich in in her own right, will receive <MONEY>4.65
million pounds</MONEY> (<MONEY>$7.96 million</MONEY>) in the <DATE>1989-90 fiscal year</DATE>, up from
<MONEY>4.55 million pounds</MONEY>.
   Her 88-year-old mother, <ORGANIZATION>Queen Mother Elizabeth</ORGANIZATION>, will get 404,000
pounds (<MONEY>$691,000</MONEY>), and <PERSON>Prince Philip</PERSON>, her husband, will be paid
225,300 pounds (<MONEY>$385,000</MONEY>).
   The queen's youngest son <PERSON>Prince Edward</PERSON>, 25, who quit the <ORGANIZATION>Royal
Marines</ORGANIZATION> and now works as a production assistant for a theater
company run by composer <PERSON>Andrew Lloyd Webber</PERSON>, does not get a raise.
He has received 20,000 pounds (<MONEY>$34,200</MONEY>) a year since <DATE>1982</DATE>.
   Prince <PERSON>Charles</PERSON>, heir to the throne, and his wife <PERSON>Diana</PERSON> are not on
the list because he is Prince of <LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION> and lives on income from the
Duchy of <LOCATION>Cornwall</LOCATION> estates. That amounted to <MONEY>1.4 million pounds</MONEY> (<MONEY>$2.4
million</MONEY>) last year.
   The largest percentage raise was for the queen's second son,
<PERSON>Prince Andrew</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Duke of York</ORGANIZATION>, a naval lieutenant on a destroyer. His
state allowance rises from 86,500 pounds (<MONEY>$148,000</MONEY>) to 155,400
pounds (nearly <MONEY>$266,000</MONEY>), or more than <PERCENT>79 percent</PERCENT>. He also will get
21,000 pounds (nearly <MONEY>$36,000</MONEY>) in service pay plus allowances.
   Andrew has been accused of taking too much leave and not handling
enough royal duties to justify his allowance.
   <PERSON>Madden</PERSON> called the raise a ``monster increase'' that would ``amaze
and astonish'' most people, who he said would not find much benefit
for themselves in the budget.
   Andrew's raise will pay for his office at <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION>,
established in <DATE>1986</DATE> when he married <PERSON>Sarah Ferguson</PERSON>, now <ORGANIZATION>Duchess of
York</ORGANIZATION>. Their staff includes a private secretary, a full-time
lady-in-waiting, up to four clerks, a chauffeur and a dresser to
look after the duchess's clothes.
   Labor legislator <PERSON>Chris Mullin</PERSON> said the royal family should pay
tax on their state grants and claimed the queen could afford it
because she is ``one of the richest people in the world.''
   <PERSON>Harold Brooks-Baker</PERSON>, publishing director of <PERSON>Burke</PERSON>'s Peerage, said
she pays the equivalent of <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> tax on the income from her
estates and invested wealth, double the top rate of her richest
subjects.
   ``The queen is the most heavily taxed person in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>,'' he
said, and estimated royal revenues at <MONEY>50 million pounds</MONEY> (<MONEY>$85.5
million</MONEY>) a year, of which the queen would retain <MONEY>10 million pounds</MONEY>
(<MONEY>$17.1 million</MONEY>).
   ``That is the same as being taxed at <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT>,'' <PERSON>Brooks-Baker</PERSON>
said.
   In the time of <PERSON>King George III</PERSON> in the <DATE>18th century</DATE>, he said,
monarchs found they could not live on their income and agreed to
surrender all revenues in return for the Civil List, a sum
Parliament deemed sufficient for their needs.
   Each monarch since has opted for the Civil List at the start of a
new reign, but because today's royal revenues are much greater than
before, the queen has been allowed to keep a portion, <PERSON>Brooks-Baker</PERSON>
said.

<HEAD>Tsutsumi Heads Forbes List of Billionaires for Second Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Yoshiaki Tsutsumi</PERSON> is a bit poorer than he was
last year _ make that less wealthy _ but the Japanese railroad
magnate still ranks as the world's richest person, according to
Forbes magazine.
   Tsutsumi, head of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Seibu Railway Group</ORGANIZATION>, has a personal
net worth of at least <MONEY>$18.9 billion</MONEY>, making him the world's richest
person for the second straight year, <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The magazine, in a report on the richest people outside the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, estimated <PERSON>Tsutsumi</PERSON>'s fortune at approximately <MONEY>$20
billion</MONEY> last fall in its first survey of the world's richest people.
   The story appears in the magazine's <DATE>July 25</DATE> issue.
   The designation for <PERSON>Tsutsumi</PERSON> again puts Forbes at odds with
Fortune magazine. In its compilation of the world's billionaires
last <DATE>October</DATE>, Fortune estimated <PERSON>Tsutsumi</PERSON>'s holdings in railroads,
hotels and golf clubs were worth a far smaller _ but still
substantial _ <MONEY>$2.5 billion</MONEY>.
   The second richest person on <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON>' list is also Japanese.
<PERSON>Taikichiro Mori</PERSON>, a former economics professor who owns 68 office
buildings in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, is worth <MONEY>$18 billion</MONEY>, the magazine estimated.
In the previous survey, <PERSON>Mori</PERSON>'s fortune was put at <MONEY>$15 billion</MONEY>.
   Following the two Japanese are the <PERSON>Reichmann</PERSON> brothers of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>,
who have built a <MONEY>$9 billion</MONEY> fortune in real estate, <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Shin Kyuk-ho</PERSON>, a South Korean with interests in candy making,
hotels and real estate, is ranked No. 4 (<MONEY>$8 billion-plus</MONEY>), and
<PERSON>Kenneth Cole Irving</PERSON>, a Canadian with interests in oil distribution,
paper and land, is No. 5 (<MONEY>$8 billion</MONEY>).
   The survey identifies 119 non-American individuals or families
around the world whose personal net assets are worth more than <MONEY>$1
billion</MONEY>, up from 90 in the previous list.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> still accounts for more billionaires than any
other country, <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON> noted. The magazine said at least 47 American
individuals and 20 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> families are worth more than <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>,
compared with 32 individuals and families in second-place <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and
16 in third-ranked <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>.
   The leading American billionaire is <PERSON>Sam Walton</PERSON>, the head of
major retailer <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart Stores</ORGANIZATION>, who ranks seventh worldwide with a
net worth of <MONEY>$6.5 billion</MONEY>, <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION> estimates.
   Not all the fortunes listed in <LOCATION>Forbes</LOCATION>' list were amassed in a
respectable way.
   Three of them belong to people the magazine identified as
Colombian drug dealers, two individuals and one family, who are all
part of the notorious <LOCATION>Medellin</LOCATION> cocaine cartel.
   Two of the Colombian cocaine fortunes, those of <PERSON>Pablo Escobar
Gaviria</PERSON> and the <PERSON>Ochoa</PERSON> family, are each more than <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY>, <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION>
said. It estimated the third, amassed by <PERSON>Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha</PERSON>,
at between <MONEY>$1.3 billion</MONEY> and <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY>.

   Six of the 10 richest people in the world are
Japanese but the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> still leads the world in the total
number of billionaires, according to estimates compiled by Forbes
magazine.
   For the third straight year, <PERSON>Yoshiaki Tsutsumi</PERSON> led <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION>' list
of private billionaires even though his wealth wasn't quite as much
as it had been 12 months earlier.
   Tsutsumi, head of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Seibu Railway Group</ORGANIZATION>, has a personal net
worth of at least <MONEY>$15 billion</MONEY> _ nearly <MONEY>$4 billion</MONEY> less than
estimated last <DATE>summer</DATE> due mainly to a rise in the value of the
dollar against other major currencies, <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   The estimate was far greater than the <MONEY>$2.8 billion</MONEY> that Fortune
magazine placed as <ORGANIZATION>Tsutsumi</ORGANIZATION>'s worth in its <DATE>September 1988</DATE> ranking of
those it considered the world's richest people.
   In last year's list, <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION> estimated <PERSON>Tsutsumi</PERSON>'s net worth as
<MONEY>$18.9 billion</MONEY>.
   The magazine reports in its <DATE>July 24</DATE> issue that <PERSON>Tsutsumi</PERSON> edged out
second-ranked Taikichiro Mori by less than <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>.
   Mori, a former economics professor who owns 72 office buildings
in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, has an estimated net worth of <MONEY>$14.2 billion</MONEY>. In last
year's survey, <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION> placed Mori's worth at about <MONEY>$18 billion</MONEY>.
   The third-richest on the list was American <PERSON>Sam Moore Walton</PERSON>,
founder of the third-largest retailer in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart
Stores Inc</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> and his family are worth an estimated <MONEY>$8.7
billion</MONEY>, up from <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION>' <DATE>1988</DATE> estimate of <MONEY>$6.5 billion</MONEY>.
   After the Waltons came <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Reichmann</PERSON> brothers, owners of the
<ORGANIZATION>Olympia &amp; York</ORGANIZATION> real estate empire, with a combined net worth of
about <MONEY>$8 billion</MONEY>.
   The rest of the 10 richest people in the world, their country and
industries, according to <LOCATION>Forbes</LOCATION>, were: <PERSON>Shin Kyuk-ho</PERSON>, <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>,
candy, real estate, <MONEY>$8 billion</MONEY>; <PERSON>Hirotomo Takei</PERSON> and family, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>,
publishing, real estate, <MONEY>$7.8 billion</MONEY>; <PERSON>Kitaro Watanabe</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, real
estate, hotels, <MONEY>$7 billion-plus</MONEY>; <PERSON>Haruhiko Yoshimoto</PERSON> and family,
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, real estate, <MONEY>$7 billion</MONEY>; <PERSON>Hans</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gad Rausing</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>,
liquids packaging, <MONEY>$7 billion</MONEY>; and <PERSON>Eitaro Itoyama</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, land, <MONEY>$6.6
billion</MONEY>.
   Forbes said it identified 226 individuals or families around the
world with personal assets worth more than <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> was the country with the most billionaires,
with 55 individuals qualifying for that title. <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> ranked second,
with 41, and <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> was third with 20.
   American also accounted for the most billionaires in the <DATE>1988</DATE>
survey, 47, followed by <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s 32 and <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>'s 16.
   Among the richest of the world's rich are people who didn't
necessarily come by their money in an honest way.
   <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>'s cocaine barons, for instance, are still putting away
piles of money from selling the illegal drug even though profit
margins in the cocaine trade have been shrinking during recent years.
   Three of them made Forbes ``World Billionaires'' list, including
<PERSON>Pablo Escobar Gaviria</PERSON>, leader of the notorious <LOCATION>Medellin</LOCATION> cocaine
cartel, with an estimated personal net worth of <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY>. The
other cocaine kingpins on the list were the <PERSON>Ochoa</PERSON> family, worth more
than <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY>, and <PERSON>Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha</PERSON>, with more than <MONEY>$1
billion</MONEY>.
   In compiling its list, <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON> does not consider royal families
and heads of state ``because their wealth derives more from
political heritage than from economic effort _ theirs are feudal
fortunes, not capitalistic ones.''
   The magazine also excludes dictators, such as <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Fidel Castro</PERSON>
or <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Kim Il Sung</PERSON>.

<TEXT>
<P>
Few fashion designers have left a legacy as permanent, as rich or as imitated 
as that of <PERSON>Gabrielle</PERSON> (Coco) <ORGANIZATION>Chanel</ORGANIZATION>. Her creations -- exquisite little black 
dresses, collarless jackets trimmed with gold buttons and braid, black-tipped 
spectator pumps, quilted handbags, the understated floral notes of Chanel No. 5 
-- remain benchmarks of superb, elegant taste. 
</P>
<P>
Dark, thin, pretty <PERSON>Gabrielle Chanel</PERSON> rose from nowhere to become the reigning 
priestess of streamlined high-fashion for almost 60 years. 329) But for all her 
fame and fortune, her string of impressive lovers and her powerful influence on 
style, she died a lonely woman -- determined to take to the grave as much of 
her story as she could. 
</P>
<P>
"She made up things," <PERSON>Axel Madsen</PERSON> says immediately. "She reinvented her 
childhood. . . . After she became rich, she paid off her brothers to pretend 
they didn't exist." 
</P>
<P>
Above all, she was ashamed of her initial poverty and the fact that her 
parents, itinerant market peddlers, were unmarried when she was born. During 
her life she would claim she was raised by old-maid aunts. But in reality, 
after her mother died and her father disappeared, 12-year-old Chanel and her 
two sisters were placed in an orphanage. 
</P>
<P>
When she was 21, working as a seamstress and residing in the military town of 
<LOCATION>Moulins</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Chanel</ORGANIZATION> met <PERSON>Etienne Balsan</PERSON>, a rich bachelor with a passion for 
racehorses. She spent six years as mistress of his estate, <LOCATION>Royallieu</LOCATION>, where she 
learned to ride, to mix with society and to set herself apart. Instead of 
wearing ready-made millinery, she bought straw boaters, intended for 
schoolboys, and trimmed them with ribbons and lace. Soon she was making hats 
for other women in her circle. 
</P>
<P>
At Royallieu, she was introduced to <PERSON>Arthur</PERSON> (Boy) <PERSON>Capel</PERSON>, a wealthy Englishman 
who became the love of her life. After they ran off to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> together, <ORGANIZATION>Chanel</ORGANIZATION> 
opened the millinery shop of her dreams -- thanks to <PERSON>Balsan</PERSON> (a truly good 
sport), who lent her an apartment for the venture, and to <PERSON>Capel</PERSON>, who helped 
finance it. 
</P>
<P>
Next came a boutique on <LOCATION>Rue Cambon</LOCATION>, the street where <ORGANIZATION>Chanel Inc.</ORGANIZATION> can be found 
today, followed by another in <LOCATION>Deauville</LOCATION>. There, <PERSON>Madsen</PERSON> says, "she invented 
sports clothes" and became the first designer to turn wool jersey -- considered 
too lifeless for anything but underwear -- into chic sportswear. 
</P>
<P>
Step by step, her professional life soared. But long-lasting love eluded her. 
(She would always maintain she had never wanted to marry and lose her 
independence.) Boy <PERSON>Capel</PERSON> wed an English aristocrat and died in an automobile 
accident while in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and planning to see Chanel one more time. The <ORGANIZATION>Duke of 
Westminster</ORGANIZATION>, her lover for 10 years, also left her for an English aristocrat -- 
one who could bear him a child, which <ORGANIZATION>Chanel</ORGANIZATION> could not. Her friends gossiped 
that she would marry <PERSON>Paul Iribe</PERSON>, but the artist and set designer collapsed and 
died on her tennis court in the middle of a game. 
</P>
<P>
Chanel's whole life was a tough game of chance in which she won more often than 
she lost. For years, the deal she struck with <PERSON>Pierre</PERSON> and <PERSON>Paul Wertheimer</PERSON> for 
Chanel No. 5 was the bane of her existence, but it eventually proved a godsend: 
The Wertheimers bankrolled her return to fashion in <DATE>1954</DATE> after a 15-year 
absence. The French spurned the collection, calling it passe, but when it 
received rave reviews in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Chanel</ORGANIZATION>'s career was reborn. Even her alleged 
collaboration with the <ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION> during World War II was swept under the carpet 
because she supposedly knew too many British secrets to go on trial. Her 
suspected collaboration was tied to a wartime romance with German diplomat <PERSON>Hans 
Gunther von Dincklage</PERSON> ("Spatz" to his friends) and her insistance on living at 
the <ORGANIZATION>Ritz Hotel</ORGANIZATION> along with the occupying Germans. 
</P>

Her escapades and her pals -- such as <LOCATION>Colette</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Cocteau</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Diaghilev</ORGANIZATION> and 
Stravinsky -- were never short on glamour and intrigue. Yet <PERSON>Madsen</PERSON> paints a 
dull, confusing picture. On page after page, the reader finds little more than 
a jumbled band of colorless stick figures, borrowed heavily from previous 
biographers, such as <PERSON>Paul Morand</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
If, as <PERSON>Madsen</PERSON> often repeats, <ORGANIZATION>Chanel</ORGANIZATION> was determined to remain a mystery; if she 
sent away in abject confusion even those to whom she chose to tell some of her 
story, why does he try his hand nearly 20 years after her death? With nothing 
fresh to contribute, he has woven an awkward, ill-fitting tale of a woman who 
devoted her life to magnificently constructed garments -- and to secrecy.

<TEXT>
   A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Prince Turki</ORGANIZATION> bin <PERSON>Abdul
Aziz</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION> would like you to know the prince is a fairly
regular guy.
   Even if he owns several homes and palaces, has a staff of 4,000
and belongs to the second-richest family in the world.
   With an entourage of nearly 100 people and a tractor-trailer
filled with luggage, that's a tough sell when you pull into a hotel
_ as the royal family did here four weeks ago _ at a cost of about
<MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> a day.
   Fact and fantasy quickly become blurred.
   Take, for example, the story of a <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION> police officer on
the special security detail who said that <PERSON>Turki</PERSON> ordered the air
conditioning turned off on the two floors he took over on arriving
at the <LOCATION>Charles Hotel</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Harvard Square</LOCATION>.
   ``They like to keep it like it is in their country. All the cops
working up there are dying,'' said the officer, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``A kid told us they even had a space
heater up there.''
   For <PERSON>Mustapha Aziz</PERSON>, the prince's political adviser and spokesman,
the reaction is typical to princes from oil-rich nations such as
<LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>, under scrutiny since American and other troops were
sent there following the <DATE>Aug. 2</DATE> Iraqi invasion of <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>.
   ``No, the air-conditioning is not off,'' <PERSON>Aziz</PERSON> said. ``That kind
of stereotype is too much.
   ``Everyone thinks we are coming here with many wives, that kind
of thing. It does not apply to this family. ... He is out of that
picture of greedy princes.''
   Still, the 53-year-old prince's penchant for frequent travel and
long stays at expensive hotels is unusual.
   The youngest of <ORGANIZATION>King Fahd</ORGANIZATION>'s six brothers, <PERSON>Turki</PERSON> has no business
dealings, lives off his inheritance and does largely philanthropic
work. He travels with a staff of 60 to 100, including seven cooks.
The costs of about 40 to 50 rooms at the <LOCATION>Charles</LOCATION> to house workers
and set up offices with facsimile machines, telephones and a
satellite dish may exceed <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY>.
   <PERSON>Aziz</PERSON> said that is not a big entourage for a member of the Fahd
family, which is worth <MONEY>$18 billion</MONEY> and is the second richest-family
in the world, according to Fortune magazine. ``We have three full
shifts,'' he said.
   Another police officer said the prince, who has his own security
detail, also hired two dozen <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION> officers at <MONEY>$200</MONEY> per day.
   ``That's for each man,'' said the officer, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``And he's got about eight Harvard cops and
some other guys.''
   The officer said when the prince's 11-year-old son wanted to
play video games one day, he was escorted to an arcade by four
police officers.
   ``The kid had <MONEY>$300</MONEY> in quarters with him,'' he added.
   Aziz could not confirm or deny those reports. Nor could he hide
his irritation.
   ``The prince does not like to show off. He gives hundreds of
donations every month, but he refuses to be identified as the man
who gave it. His is not the Trump style,'' said <PERSON>Aziz</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Aziz</PERSON> said that had the Iraqi invasion not occurred, few would
have known he was in town to discuss contributions to <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> and
have his three children get medical checkups.
   At a recent news conference to discuss events in the <LOCATION>Mideast</LOCATION>,
the prince was affable but unassuming. But the breakfast he offered
for reporters was certainly one befitting a prince.
   There was cheese _ brie, camembert, saga blue and port salut; a
dozen fruits; six fruit juices; smoked salmon with caviar; petit
filet mignon; <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> waffles; poached eggs on pumpernickel muffin
with basil hollandaise; two preparation stations for egg dishes,
and a full <LOCATION>Mideast</LOCATION> menu.
   Waiters presented a long-stemmed red rose to each woman in
attendance. And it was all set off by 750 orchids.
   Like her husband, <ORGANIZATION>Princess Hend</ORGANIZATION> wore Western clothes.
   She made headlines years ago when she got in a melee with police
checking out reports of mistreatment of workers at the prince's
home in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>. That's the house where the family created a stir
with a lavish birthday party for his son that included a cake
topped off with live flamingos.
   At one point in the news conference, the princess, whose English
is good, interrupted to say the translator had mangled the exchange
between a reporter and the prince. He tried again.
   ``Her royal highness is the type who likes to speak her mind.
Everyone in the media try to harm this image,'' said <PERSON>Aziz</PERSON>. ``She is
the type of woman for our future.''

<TEXT>
   On a continent where kings were once
revered as gods, <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>'s half-dozen surviving monarchies include a
diverse clutch of modernizing kings and a sultan who wields absolute
power.
   King <PERSON>Bhumibol Adulyadej</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>, the world's longest reigning
monarch following the death <DATE>Jan. 7</DATE> of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Emperor Hirohito</PERSON>, has
initiated several thousand rural projects and spends much of each
year in the countryside personally helping peasants to design
irrigation canals, improve crops and combat disease.
   Aside from <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, monarchs also reign in <LOCATION>Nepal</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Bhutan</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>Himalayias</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> on <LOCATION>Borneo</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> in
<LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION>.
   Unlike his remote predecessors in <LOCATION>Nepal</LOCATION>, Harvard-educated <PERSON>King
Birendra</PERSON> criss-crosses his mountainous nation and has set a goal of
fulfilling the basic needs of an impoverished populace by the year
<DATE>2000</DATE>.
   In the kingdom of <LOCATION>Bhutan</LOCATION>, <PERSON>King Jigme Singye Wangchuk</PERSON> pores over
economic development plans and almost daily deals with petitions
submitted by subjects.
   Hirohito, whose funeral will be held <DATE>Feb. 24</DATE>, is widely credited
with having helped <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s postwar economic miracle by preserving
national unity and traditional virtues through his symbolic role.
But the late emperor, who renounced his divinity after <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s
defeat in World War II, spent most of his 62 years on the
Chrysanthemum Throne behind the walls of <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Palace</ORGANIZATION>.
   His son and successor, Emperor <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>, 55, broke with tradition
by marrying a commoner and has travelled with his family by train,
thrown out the first ball at baseball games and mixed with his
fellow Japanese at numerous public functions.
   Though he is expected to breach some of the barriers between
emperor and subjects, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> is unlikely to interact as intimately
with his subjects and their daily problems as do the other Asian
royals _ nor wield anywhere near as much tangible power.
   The most powerful and richest of the continent's five remaining
hereditary monarchs is <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s Sultan <PERSON>Hassanal Bolkiah</PERSON>, an absolute
ruler who resides in a 1,788-room palace and keeps some of his 200
horses in air-conditioned stables. Fortune magazine in the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> <DATE>last year</DATE> named him the world's richest man, with assets
estimated at <MONEY>$25 billion</MONEY>.
   Besides being head of state, he is also prime minister and
defense minister and has included two of his brothers in the Cabinet
to help rule over the oil-rich nation about the size of <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> on
the north coast of <LOCATION>Borneo</LOCATION> island.
   <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s sultan harkens back to days when the pomp, pageantry and
proclamations of hundreds of bluebloods _ kings, princes, sultans,
maharajahs, newabs and nizams _ were as vital a part of <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> as its
rice fields.
   But by mid-century, royal ranks had been thinned by communist
revolutions, independence struggles and the spread of Western
democracy. Other crowns have toppled in more recent times.
   The last emperor of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> abdicated in <DATE>1912</DATE>. Communists ended
imperial rule in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> at the end of World War II. <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s
independence from <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION> in <DATE>1947</DATE> sounded the knell for
myriads of royals. <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION>'s kingdom ended amidst war and chaos in
<DATE>1970</DATE>, though Prince <PERSON>Norodom Sihanouk</PERSON>, formerly the king, is still
active as an exiled guerrilla faction leader. The last king of
<LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mohammad Zaher Shah</PERSON>, was toppled in <DATE>1973</DATE> and is exiled
in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> but recently offered to help in a transitional government
in his country.
   Today, there remain but five Asian hereditary kingdoms and
<LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>, where every five years one of the country's sultans is
elected a constitutional monarch.
   Nine of <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>'s 13 states have sultans who are constitutional
heads of the state governments. They have no political power. Every
five years these sultans meet to elect by secret ballot one of
themselves to be the national king. By tacit agreement each state
gets a turn at having its sultan king sooner or later. At the
national level the king is the constitutional head of state but
political power rests with prime minister.
   The present king of <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> is Sultan <PERSON>Mahmood Iskandar</PERSON> from
Jahore state. His term expires this year.
   Today's Asian monarchies have deep roots and their forseeable
futures appear secure.
   Akihito is 125th in a line of emperors said to stretch back 2,600
years in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. Though historians regard the first 14 emperors as
figures of myth, the Japanese imperial line is still the world's
oldest hereditary monarchy, and current public opinion polls favor
its continuation.
   Bhumibol, probably the most respected man in <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>, is heir to
750 years of monarchy.
   Bolkiah is <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s 29th ruler while <LOCATION>Nepal</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Bhutan</LOCATION> both have
centuries-old royal traditions.
   Although a constitutional monarch, the 61-year-old Thai king is
regarded as semi-divine by some and widely viewed as having held the
country together in wake of the coups and abortive power grabs that
have marked recent decades. He openly intervened to stop a serious
student-led uprising in <DATE>1973</DATE> and has in other moments of national
crisis played a decisive behind-the-scenes role.
   Named king in <DATE>1946</DATE> and crowned <DATE>four years later</DATE>, when he was a
jazz-loving teen-ager, <PERSON>Bhumibol</PERSON> was initially viewed as someone to
be used by military strongmen. Instead, he gradually reversed the
decline in prestige of the throne, largely by by-passing the elite
to work for the mass of have-nots in the countryside.
   <LOCATION>Nepal</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Birendra</LOCATION>, 43, likewise has sought links with the rural
poor, making frequent trips to remote areas to hand out relief
supplies and sound out the problems of villagers. But knowledgable
sources in <LOCATION>Nepal</LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> say much of the effort is
negated by corruption within the royal family and its retainers _ an
open secret in <LOCATION>Katmandu</LOCATION>, the capital.
   Birendra has initiated some political reforms during his 16-year
rule but there are quiet critics of both the monarchy and limited
democratic rights. The king himself, seen as a reincarnation of the
Hindu god Vishnu, by law cannot be criticized.
   In <LOCATION>Bhutan</LOCATION>, the publicity-shy, 33-year-old <PERSON>King Jigme Singye
Wangchuk</PERSON> has continued his father's attempts at political evolution
and improvement in the lives of his 1.4 million, largely illiterate
people.
   ``Development is important but preserving our culture and our
values is equally important,'' <PERSON>Jigme Singye</PERSON> has said.
   <LOCATION>Bhutan</LOCATION> was only opened up from its medieval seclusion by his
reform-minded father.
   International aid agencies have been welcomed to <LOCATION>Bhutan</LOCATION> but mass
tourism has not. Tourism is seen as a destroyer of the old ways
upheld by the king, who always wears the traditional, robe-like
``kho'' _ even while playing basketball _ and is married to four
sisters of noble line, another time-honored custom.
   <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s politics are said to be among the most sterile in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>
but the tiny state's 227,000 people have yet to show significant
signs of discontent. Under the 42-year-old sultan, the country
continues to prosper from its oil and natural gas reserves. Medical
care and education are free and the per capita annual income of
<MONEY>$21,000</MONEY> is among the highest in the world.
   The sultan, who has snapped up hotels, companies and other
investments around the world, moves freely among his subjects and is
credited with a number of civic improvements.

<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Association of Southeast
Asian Nations</ORGANIZATION> is in town for it 22nd meeting and the streets are
bedecked with bunting, so why do the decorations feature the number
43 instead of 22?
   Because the bunting isn't for the delegates; it's for the sultan,
who turns 43 on <DATE>July 15</DATE>.
   The sultan, who has 37 words in his name and title, is worth <MONEY>$30
billion</MONEY> and takes very good care of the 241,000 people over whom he
has absolute sway.
   He is <PERSON>Duli Yang Maha Mulia Paduka Seri Baginda Sultan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Yang
Di-Pertuan Negeri Brunei Awang Muda Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'issaddin
Waddaulah Ibni Duli Yang Teramat Mulia Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan
Awang Muda Omar Ali Aifuddin Saifuddin Sa'adul Khairi Waddin</PERSON>.
   Most people just call him Sir <PERSON>Hassanal Bolkiah</PERSON>.
   His sultanate, 2,226 square miles on the north coast of <LOCATION>Borneo</LOCATION>,
sits on a huge pool of oil and natural gas.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Guinness Book of World Records</ORGANIZATION> says Sir Hassanal is the
world's richest individual becauwe oil income and foreign currency
reserves totaling almost <MONEY>$30 billion</MONEY> are ``effectively at his
disposal.''
   Fortune magazine confirmed his enormous wealth and said <PERSON>King Fahd</PERSON>
of <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION> was second with <MONEY>$18 billion</MONEY>.
   Secular, religious and military power rest with the sultan, a
hereditary ruler who is head of state, prime minister, defense
minister and commander of the armed forces.
   One of his brothers is in charge of foreign affairs and another
heads the <ORGANIZATION>Finance Ministry</ORGANIZATION> of this former British protectorate,
which became fully independent five years ago.
   As well as being the richest person in the world, Sir Hassanal
lives with his relatives in the world's biggest palace _ a complex
of buildings built with 38 types of marble on a 300-acre hill near
the <LOCATION>Brunei River</LOCATION>.
   In case friends decide to stay over, it has 1,778 rooms and 257
toilets. There are 564 chandeliers, 18 elevators, 44 staircases and
a banquet hall that seats 4,000.
   His majesty's polo ponies have air-conditioned quarters.
   More than 2,000 workers completed the Istana (palace) <PERSON>Nurul Imam</PERSON>
for independence in <DATE>1984</DATE> and the sultan never said how much it cost.
Guesses at the time started at <MONEY>$250 million</MONEY>, but suppliers who know
what went into it _ including 22-carat gold tiles on interior arches
_ say at least <MONEY>$600 million</MONEY>.
   The sultan has two wives. He was married first to Her Majesty the
<PERSON>Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha</PERSON> and then to Her Royal Highness
Pengiran Isteri Hajjah Mariam. He has three sons and six daughters.
Saleha, the sultan's first cousin, resides in the <LOCATION>Nurul Imam</LOCATION>.
   Mariam (born <ORGANIZATION>Mariam Bell</ORGANIZATION>) keeps house in a smaller and newer
palace, <LOCATION>Nurulizza</LOCATION>, 14 miles from the capital. Their marriage caused
a rift between the sultan and his father, <PERSON>Sir Omar</PERSON>, because she was
a commoner and part Japanese. <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> occupied <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> during World War
II. The sultan met <PERSON>Mariam</PERSON> when she was a hostess on the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Brunei
Airlines</ORGANIZATION>.
   The royal family, in power for 29 generations, ensures continued
support for autocracy by providing subsidized food, fuel, housing
and free education and medical care. There is no personal income tax.
   Shortly after independence, <LOCATION>Sir Hassanal</LOCATION> was quoted as saying his
subjects enjoyed ``a good life. Why should they want more?''
   Bruneians seem content. The happiest probably are the civil
servants, who make up <PERCENT>46 percent</PERCENT> of the work force of 85,000. Along
with standard benefits, they get free pensions and interest-free
loans to buy cars and houses.
   Traffic jams are common in <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, which has one car for every
2.3 people.
   Prince <PERSON>Mohamed Bolkiah</PERSON>, the foreign minister, told reporters
covering the conference: ``The people seem to be very happy with the
way we are running things. The people accept it.''
   They certainly are spared worries that trouble the foreigners
here assembled. There is no national debt, no trade deficit, no
balance of payments problem and the budget always shows a surplus.
Oil and natural gas account for <PERCENT>99 percent</PERCENT> of exports.
   Sir <PERSON>Hassanal</PERSON> was attending <ORGANIZATION>Sandhurst Military College</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>
when his father abdicated in <DATE>1967</DATE> and he was summoned home at age 21
to take the throne.
   Sultan Omar continued to run things from behind the scenes for
another 15 years, however, and the polo-playing young potentate took
the opportunity to build an international reputation as a playboy.
   <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s last flirtation with an elected parliament was in <DATE>1962</DATE>,
when it was still a British protectorate.
   The Parti Rakyat <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, since outlawed, won all 16 seats on the
<ORGANIZATION>Legislative Council</ORGANIZATION>. Sultan Omar refused to convene the council and
an uprising ensued.
   Britain crushed the rebellion and a state of emergency declared
at the time remains in force.

<TEXT>
   A hitherto unknown relative of <ORGANIZATION>Queen Elizabeth II</ORGANIZATION>
has placed one foot out of obscurity, claiming his father was the
product of an illicit love affair between a dashing aristocrat and
a lady-in-waiting, a blueblood chronicler says.
   The relative is a 49-year-old engineer whose first name is
Anthony. He lives with his wife and two teen-age children in a
modest three-bedroom house in a suburb of <LOCATION>Manchester</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>northern
England</LOCATION>. But that's all he wants the public to know.
   Anthony says he is the queen's second cousin, once removed, and
according to <PERSON>Harold Brooks-Baker</PERSON>, publishing director of <PERSON>Burke</PERSON>'s
Peerage, ``he is her closest illegitimate documented relative.''
   <PERSON>Brooks-Baker</PERSON> said <PERSON>Anthony</PERSON>'s grandfather was <PERSON>Charles Bowes-Lyon</PERSON>,
a first cousin of the queen's mother, Queen Mother <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON>.
   ``<PERSON>Anthony</PERSON> wants his family to be included in <LOCATION>Burke</LOCATION>'s Peerage
along with his noble ancestors,'' <PERSON>Brooks-Baker</PERSON> said. ``He wants his
children to be received by the <PERSON>Bowes-Lyon</PERSON> family.''
   He stepped forward when <PERSON>Burke</PERSON>'s Peerage, known as the blueblood
bible, announced a year ago that it intended to begin listing the
illegitimate offspring of nobility and royalty in future editions.
   Burke's Peerage authenticated <PERSON>Anthony</PERSON>'s royal links through his
birth certificate, letters and photographs, but respected his wish
to remain anonymous.
   Anthony feared public recognition might destroy his family's
quiet lifestyle and has asked to be listed as ``The Unknown
Royal,'' <PERSON>Brooks-Baker</PERSON> said.
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s tabloid newspapers have offered him up to <MONEY>$85,000</MONEY> for
exclusive rights to his story, but <PERSON>Anthony</PERSON> has refused,
<PERSON>Brooks-Baker</PERSON> said.
   ``He has refused all monies,'' <PERSON>Brooks-Baker</PERSON> said. ``He is an
unbelievably shy man and is far from rich, but he has no problems
financially.''
   In <DATE>1908</DATE>, <PERSON>Bowes-Lyon</PERSON>, a second lieutenant in the British army,
``fell passionately in love with this attractive woman who was a
sort of companion to his aunt'' at the family's stately home,
<PERSON>Ridley Hall</PERSON>, in <LOCATION>northeast England</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Brooks-Baker</PERSON> said.
   A year later, they had a child and asked permission to marry,
``but a marriage between somebody of that station and a
lady-in-waiting was really out of the question,'' he said.
   Bowes-Lyon was sent to <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> for three years ``to recover from
this great love,'' and the mother and child went to live at her
family's home in <LOCATION>Cheshire</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>northwest England</LOCATION>, he said.
   The child, <PERSON>Charles</PERSON>, was registered as a Lindsay, the
lieutenant's mother's maiden surname.
   <PERSON>Brooks-Baker</PERSON> said <PERSON>Bowes-Lyon</PERSON>'s love for the woman never faded,
and that he possibly planned to marry her. But World War I
intervened, and he was killed in battle in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> on <DATE>Oct. 23, 1914</DATE>.
   Illegitimate children ``cannot claim their full share of an
inheritance'' but the <PERSON>Bowes-Lyon</PERSON> family ``looked after the child,''
<PERSON>Brooks-Baker</PERSON> said.
   They paid for his schooling and, when he turned 18, sent his
mother 600 pounds (then about <MONEY>$2,700</MONEY>) in Canadian railway stocks to
help him set up in business.
   ``That is one of the best examples I know of the aristocratic
tradition of accepting illegitimacy in an understanding and
Christian way,'' <PERSON>Brooks-Baker</PERSON> said.
   Charles later married and had a son, <PERSON>Anthony</PERSON>. He ended up a
shopkeeper in the <LOCATION>English Midlands</LOCATION>, where he died in <DATE>1976</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Brooks-Baker</PERSON> said the <PERSON>Bowes-Lyon</PERSON> family gathered <DATE>Friday</DATE> to
discuss <PERSON>Anthony</PERSON>'s claim to his past and ``there's no question about
anyone denying it.''

FT  27 NOV 92 / Queen will start to pay income tax from April: Decision seen
as move towards a smaller, European-style monarchy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUEEN <PERSON>ELIZABETH II</PERSON> has heralded the most sweeping reform of the British
monarchy since her accession 40 years ago by agreeing to pay income tax and
to support financially all but three members of her family.
Her decision amounts to a move towards a smaller continental European-style
monarchy. It was announced by <PERSON>Mr John Major</PERSON> just two days after the Queen
hinted that she recognised public dissatisfaction over the cost - and
behaviour - of her family. The prime minister said the move came at her
initiative.
The Queen is said to be the richest woman in the world with investments
alone estimated at Pounds 50m. From next <DATE>April</DATE> she will pay tax on her
private income at the 40 per cent top rate. She will probably also pay
inheritance and capital gains tax - but under arrangements still to be
decided because normally her wealth could be wiped out on her death.
Discussions are taking place between the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION>, the Inland Revenue and
the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Household</ORGANIZATION> before a fuller statement early next year. The Prince of
<LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION> is likely to pay more tax on income from the Duchy of <LOCATION>Cornwall</LOCATION>. After
escaping paying the poll tax, the Queen will pay the council tax on her
<LOCATION>Sandringham</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Balmoral</LOCATION> homes.
From next year only the Queen, the Queen Mother and the <ORGANIZATION>Duke of Edinburgh</ORGANIZATION>
will be paid incomes out of the 'civil list' voted by parliament. At present
the Queen receives Pounds 7.9m, the <ORGANIZATION>Queen Mother Pounds</ORGANIZATION> 643,000 and the <ORGANIZATION>Duke
of Edinburgh Pounds</ORGANIZATION> 359,000 from the civil list.
The salaries drawn by five other members of the royal family will be
reimbursed to the public purse. <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> said the five - the
Queen's three younger children, her sister <PERSON>Princess Margaret</PERSON>, and her
90-year-old aunt <PERSON>Princess Alice</PERSON> - will go on performing public duties.
Although the <ORGANIZATION>Inland Revenue</ORGANIZATION> will keep details of royal finances secret, as
for any taxpayer, and even though taxes were paid by <PERSON>Queen Victoria</PERSON>, <PERSON>George
V</PERSON> and <PERSON>Edward VII</PERSON>, the move marks a watershed for the monarchy.
It was seen at <LOCATION>Westminster</LOCATION> as an attempt to restore the monarchy's
reputation after, in the Queen's words, an annus horribilis dominated by
rumours about royal marriages and rows over its extravagance. The political
debate over who should pay to restore the fire-damaged <ORGANIZATION>Windsor Castle</ORGANIZATION> may
have led to the changes being announced.
Moreover, the Queen, in whose name the Inland Revenue collects taxes has
become liable herself. <PERSON>Mr Rhodri Morgan</PERSON>, MP for <ORGANIZATION>Cardiff West</ORGANIZATION>, said she could
have created an extra 25 jobs for tax inspectors at the <ORGANIZATION>Inland Revenue</ORGANIZATION>'s
high-security unit in <LOCATION>Cardiff</LOCATION>.
The announcement came in pre-scripted exchanges in the Commons between <PERSON>Mr
Major</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr John Smith</PERSON>, the Labour leader, who had been briefed on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
<PERSON>Mr Smith</PERSON> asked the prime minister if, 'in view of the evident public
concern', he had had discussions with the Queen about her finances.
Mr Major replied that 'affection and respect' for the monarch were
widespread and the sovereign was not liable to pay tax on her personal
income. 'But <ORGANIZATION>Her Majesty</ORGANIZATION> some months ago, before the <DATE>summer</DATE> recess,
indicated to me that she wished consideration to be given to changing these
arrangements.'
The Queen will not be taxed on sums voted by MPs to cover costs of items
such as royal flights and trains, which totalled Pounds 57m last year. But
she will pay tax on private income from the Duchy of <LOCATION>Lancaster</LOCATION>. The Prince
of <LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION> already pays tax on his private income and voluntarily contributes
25 per cent of income from the Duchy of <LOCATION>Cornwall</LOCATION>.

   British actress <PERSON>Jane Seymour</PERSON> says she found
much to admire in <PERSON>Wallis Simpson</PERSON>, the American divorcee who became
the duchess of <LOCATION>Windsor</LOCATION>, the woman the English loved to hate.
   ``She was the woman who stole their king,'' says <PERSON>Seymour</PERSON>, who
portrays <PERSON>Simpson</PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> movie, ``The Woman He Loved.''
   ``They hated her. She was a naive American who didn't understand
the monarchy or how it worked or what it stood for. She thought
<PERSON>David</PERSON> could make her his queen.''
   Instead, <PERSON>David</PERSON>, already <PERSON>King Edward VIII</PERSON> but not yet crowned,
was forced to abdicate in <DATE>1936</DATE> to marry <LOCATION>Wallis</LOCATION>. They became the
duke and duchess of <LOCATION>Windsor</LOCATION> and lived the rest of their lives in
exile.
   The two-hour movie, which <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> will televise on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, also
stars <PERSON>Anthony Andrews</PERSON> as <PERSON>David</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Olivia de Havilland</LOCATION> as <PERSON>Wallis</PERSON>' <PERSON>Aunt
Bessie</PERSON>, <PERSON>Julie Harris</PERSON> as her mother, <PERSON>Lucy Gutteridge</PERSON> as another
woman who saw herself as <PERSON>David</PERSON>'s queen, <PERSON>Robert Hardy</PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION>Winston
Churchill</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Phyllis Calvert</PERSON> as Queen <PERSON>Mary</PERSON>.
   ``I've never heard anyone say a good word about her,'' <PERSON>Seymour</PERSON>
says. ``Other than that, she gave great dinner parties. But I liked
her. She had a sense of humor, a straightforwardness. She was
definitely attentive to her husband and, although she was no
beauty, she had style and elegance. I certainly wouldn't trust her
with my husband.
   ``It's boring to play a perfect person. But to play a woman who
was not liked and to find something about her that is likeable is
fascinating.''
   Seymour says she saw <PERSON>David</PERSON> as a weak man who never really wanted
to be king. <PERSON>Wallis Simpson</PERSON> fulfilled some of his needs.
   ``Rumor has it that <PERSON>Wallis</PERSON> learned to do sexual tricks when she
lived in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>,'' she says. ``The king had a few problems in that
area and she fixed them.''
   When <PERSON>Wallis</PERSON> first met <PERSON>David</PERSON>, he was the prince of <LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION> and she
was married to American businessman <PERSON>Ernest Simpson</PERSON>. The flirtation
turned to romance, and <PERSON>Simpson</PERSON>'s marriage to divorce. Her plan was
to marry <PERSON>David</PERSON> and become queen, but the British prime minister and
royal family forbade his marriage as king to a twice-divorced woman.
   ``The Woman He Loved'' takes a different and less political
approach than the British-made miniseries ``Edward and <PERSON>Mrs.
Simpson</PERSON>,'' which ran on <ORGANIZATION>PBS</ORGANIZATION> several years ago.
   English newspapers became heavily involved with the making of
``The Woman He Loved'' and <PERSON>Seymour</PERSON> says one paper seemed to give
royal status to her role-playing. The Times published <PERSON>Seymour</PERSON>'s
picture as the duchess at <ORGANIZATION>David</ORGANIZATION>'s funeral. It went on the <ORGANIZATION>Court
Circular Page</ORGANIZATION>, a serious chronicle of royal events.
   ``I tried to play her in various shades of gray,'' <PERSON>Seymour</PERSON> says.
``I play her the way I believe she was thinking at the time. She
was manipulating things. She had a great plan and it didn't work. I
purposely don't play her sympathetically.''
   Parts of the movie were filmed in western <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, where <PERSON>Seymour</PERSON>
owns a 15th-century estate outside the old Roman spa city of Bath.
She stayed at her home, <ORGANIZATION>St. Catherine's Court</ORGANIZATION>, during that time.
   Seymour divides her time between <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, where she is still a
citizen, and this country, where she has lived for the past 10
years. She and her husband, American businessman <PERSON>David Flynn</PERSON>, have
two children, <PERSON>Katie</PERSON>, 5, born here, and <PERSON>Sean</PERSON>, 2, born in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>.
   She works mostly in American television and films, having shed
her English accent in order to play American roles.
   Seymour was on her way to <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> to play opera star <PERSON>Maria Callas</PERSON>
in the <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> miniseries ``Onassis: The Richest Man in the World.''
The four-hour miniseries, which tells of the romance between <PERSON>Callas</PERSON>
and Greek magnate <PERSON>Aristotle Onassis</PERSON> (<PERSON>Raul Julia</PERSON>), will be televised
in early <DATE>May</DATE>.
   She has already completed her role as <PERSON>Natalie Jastrow Henry</PERSON> in
``War and Remembrance,'' the 30-hour miniseries being readied for
<ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> next season. So far she has starred in 10 American miniseries.
   ``This seems to be my `duchess and diva' period,'' she says with
a laugh. ``I seem to be getting some great roles now. It's very
exciting. I'm like a chameleon, changing the way I look, the way I
sound, the kind of roles I play.''
   She took over the role played by <PERSON>Ali MacGraw</PERSON> in ``The Winds of
War,'' the first of author <PERSON>Herman Wouk</PERSON>'s two massive novels on
World War II.
   For her role as <PERSON>Maria Callas</PERSON> she had to learn to sing several
arias. She also worked with dialect coach <PERSON>Robert Easton</PERSON> for her
roles as <PERSON>Wallis Simpson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Maria Callas</PERSON>.
   Next, she goes to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> for a role in the <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> miniseries ``Jack
the Ripper.'' She plays the romantic interest to <PERSON>Michael Caine</PERSON>, who
stars as <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION> Yard Inspector <PERSON>Frederick Abberline</PERSON>. <PERSON>Armand
Assante</PERSON> also stars as an American actor playing ``Dr. Jekyll and
<PERSON>Mr. Hyde</PERSON>'' on the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> stage at the time of <PERSON>Jack the Ripper</PERSON>'s
reign of terror.

   A man ranked the wealthiest
in the world runs this tiny oil-rich Moslem kingdom, and diplomats
report little dissent from people unencumbered by income taxes,
medical payments or tuition fees.
   King <PERSON>Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah</PERSON> rules the enclave on the
northeastern tip of <LOCATION>Borneo</LOCATION> from his 1,788-room palace. Earlier this
month, Fortune magazine called him the richest man in the world,
worth <MONEY>$25 billion</MONEY>.
   Citizens of this southeast Asian nation do not appear to object
to the king's rule because he spreads some of the money around.
   ``They (the people) are well looked after, with free education,
medical treatment, cheap housing, good pensions and any one doing
well in his studies can easily get a university education abroad at
the government's expense,'' said one diplomat, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   He said there are no beggars, and about half the workforce is
employed by the government. The per capita income is estimated at
about <MONEY>$18,000</MONEY>, one of the highest in the world, according to
bankers and diplomats.
   All the money comes from oil and gas, which <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> exports
mainly to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
   A <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> government official said recently that <DATE>1986</DATE> exports
amounted to <MONEY>$2.03 billion</MONEY> _ <PERCENT>99 percent</PERCENT> of it oil and gas. Imports
for the same year totaled <MONEY>$785 million</MONEY> in cars, foodstuffs and
other goods.
   The nation, about the size of <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION>, covers just 2,226 square
miles, much of which is not suitable for cultivation, an
agricultural officer said.
   Without daily newspapers, the nation's 227,000 people get their
news mainly through state-run radio, <LOCATION>Television Brunei</LOCATION> and some
government publications.
   An official in the <ORGANIZATION>Planning Unit</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Malays</PERSON> form the majority
of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s population, but there are also about 60,000 Chinese and
other non-Malays.
   About 87,000 people are employed and of these 28,000 are foreign
workers, including foreign maids, doctors, lawyers, engineers,
accountants and others.
   <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> has no elected <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Sultan Bolkiah</PERSON> rules the
nation with the help of a Cabinet comprising two of his brothers
and about seven other people.
   The 41-year-old monarch, who studied in neighboring <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>
before a stint at the <ORGANIZATION>British Military Academy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Sandhurst</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1966</DATE>, was crowned the 29th King of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> in <DATE>1967</DATE> by
his father Sir <PERSON>Omar Ali Saifuddin</PERSON>, who abdicated in favor of his
son.
   The king loves polo and has about 200 Argentine polo ponies,
some of which are kept in air-conditioned stables. He has two wives
and six children.
   In the 14th and <DATE>15th century</DATE>, <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> was a large empire
stretching from the northern <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> to most parts of <LOCATION>Borneo</LOCATION>,
but when the colonialists came <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> shrank. <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> became a
British protectorate in <DATE>1906</DATE> and won its independence on <DATE>Dec. 31,
1983</DATE>.
   The country has no income tax, gasoline is cheap and there are
no major taxes on cars, which are imported from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and
elsewhere. Diplomats estimate foreign reserves at <MONEY>$20 billion</MONEY>.
   The King has powers to detain and hold without trial anyone
deemed to be a threat to the security of the nation. On <DATE>July 14</DATE>,
the government released 34 such detainees, leaving just six still
in custody.
   Diplomats say there appears to be no long-term threat to
<LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s economy as the 120,000 barrels of oil being pumped daily
is expected to last ``well into the next century''.
   <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> is officially known as <LOCATION>Brunei Darusalam</LOCATION>.
   Darusalam means abode of peace ``and there is indeed peace
here'' said a diplomat, who added ``they could have added
prosperity to it.''

Six of the 10 richest people in the world are Japanese but the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> 
still leads the world in the total number of billionaires, according to 
estimates compiled by Forbes magazine. 
</P>
<P>
For the third straight year, <PERSON>Yoshiaki Tsutsumi</PERSON> led <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION>' list of private 
billionaires even though his wealth wasn't reported to be quite as great as had 
been estimated 12 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Tsutsumi, head of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Seibu Railway Group</ORGANIZATION>, has a personal net worth of at 
least <MONEY>$15 billion</MONEY> -- nearly <MONEY>$4 billion</MONEY> less than estimated last <DATE>summer</DATE> due 
mainly to a rise in the value of the dollar against other major currencies, 
<ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The estimate was far greater than the <MONEY>$2.8 billion</MONEY> that Fortune magazine had 
reported as <ORGANIZATION>Tsutsumi</ORGANIZATION>'s worth in its <DATE>September, 1988</DATE>, ranking of those whom it 
considered to be the world's richest people. 
</P>
<P>
In last year's list, <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION> estimated <PERSON>Tsutsumi</PERSON>'s net worth at <MONEY>$18.9 billion</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine reports in its <DATE>July 24</DATE> issue that <PERSON>Tsutsumi</PERSON> edged out second-ranked 
Taikichiro Mori by less than <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
Mori, a former economics professor who owns 72 office buildings in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, has 
an estimated net worth of <MONEY>$14.2 billion</MONEY>. In last year's survey, <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION> placed 
Mori's worth at about <MONEY>$18 billion</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Walton No. 3 
</P>
<P>
The third-richest on the list was American <PERSON>Sam Moore Walton</PERSON>, founder of the 
third-largest retail operation in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart Stores Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Walton</PERSON> and his family are worth an estimated <MONEY>$8.7 billion</MONEY>, up from <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION>' <DATE>1988</DATE> 
estimate of <MONEY>$6.5 billion</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
After the Waltons came <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Reichmann</PERSON> brothers, owners of the <ORGANIZATION>Olympia &amp; 
York</ORGANIZATION> real estate empire, with a combined net worth of about <MONEY>$8 billion</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the 10 richest people in the world, their country and 
industries, according to <LOCATION>Forbes</LOCATION>, were: <PERSON>Shin Kyuk-ho</PERSON>, <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>, candy, real 
estate, <MONEY>$8 billion</MONEY>; <PERSON>Hirotomo Takei</PERSON> and family, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, publishing, real estate, 
<MONEY>$7.8 billion</MONEY>; <PERSON>Kitaro Watanabe</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, real estate, hotels, <MONEY>$7 billion-plus</MONEY>; 
<PERSON>Haruhiko Yoshimoto</PERSON> and family, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, real estate, <MONEY>$7 billion</MONEY>; <PERSON>Hans</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gad 
Rausing</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, liquids packaging, <MONEY>$7 billion</MONEY>; and <PERSON>Eitaro Itoyama</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, 
land, <MONEY>$6.6 billion</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes said it identified 226 individuals or families around the world with 
personal assets worth in excess of <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> was the country with the most billionaires, with 55 
individuals qualifying for that title. <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> ranked second with 41, and <LOCATION>West 
Germany</LOCATION> was third with 20. 
</P>
<P>
America also accounted for the most billionaires in the <DATE>1988</DATE> survey, 47, 
followed by <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s 32 and <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>'s 16. 
</P>
<P>
Among the richest of the world's rich are people who didn't necessarily come by 
their money in an honest way. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not All Legitimate 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>'s cocaine barons, for instance, are still putting away piles of money 
from selling the illegal drug even though profit margins in the cocaine trade 
have been shrinking in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Three of them made Forbes "World Billionaires" list, including <PERSON>Pablo Escobar 
Gaviria</PERSON>, leader of the notorious <LOCATION>Medellin</LOCATION> cocaine cartel, with an estimated 
personal net worth of <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
In compiling its list, <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON> does not consider royal families and heads of 
state "because their wealth derives more from political heritage than from 
economic effort."

<HL> Sultan of Brunei to Pay $200 Million
For Beverly Hills Hotel, Sources Say

<TEXT>
   The Sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, one of the world's wealthiest men, has agreed to buy the legendary <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION> Hotel from oil tycoon <PERSON>Marvin Davis</PERSON> for more than <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY>, hotel sources said. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON> purchased the <ORGANIZATION>Beverly Hills Hotel</ORGANIZATION>, also known as the <ORGANIZATION>Pink Palace</ORGANIZATION> for its distinctive coloring and its star-studded clientele, from the family of <PERSON>Ivan F. Boesky</PERSON> and others for about <MONEY>$135 million</MONEY> last <DATE>December</DATE>. 
The sale followed <PERSON>Mr. Boesky</PERSON>'s <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> settlement of insider-trading charges brought by the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The hotel sources said <PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON> and the Sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> have agreed on a price, and the transaction is expected to close sometime next week. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON> couldn't be reached, and spokesmen for him declined to comment. 

   The purchase of the posh hotel was the jewel in <PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON>'s growing block of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> real estate and restored some of the glamour the investor gave up by selling <ORGANIZATION>Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Rupert Murdoch</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON> also said, after he bought the hotel, that the purchase had personal meaning, because he spent his honeymoon in the hotel and once lived in one of its bungalows. 

   Since the purchase of the hotel, <PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON> has frequently presided over breakfasts in the hotel's <ORGANIZATION>Polo Lounge</ORGANIZATION>, a popular breakfast locale for the entertainment industry. 

   Hotel sources also said they understood the sultan was reportedly a losing bidder in the <DATE>December</DATE> sale of the hotel but persisted in trying to buy the hotel from <PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON>. 
"The guy finally came back with a price that was so far and away unbelievable that (<PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON>) just had to say OK," said one hotel source, adding, "<PERSON>Marvin</PERSON> has a deep personal attachment to the place." 

   Another factor in <PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON>'s decision to sell the 75-year-old hotel was his discovery that renovation costs would be higher than originally estimated, according to the source. 
<PERSON>Michael Ullman</PERSON>, the hotel's general manager, has said the hotel was planning "substantial renovations" and even the addition of a nightclub. 
Many of the hotel's competitors, including the <LOCATION>Beverly Wilshire Hotel</LOCATION>, are being renovated. 

   A price-tag for the hotel of more than <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY> wouldn't make a very big dent in the net worth of the sultan. 
In its current issue, Fortune magazine pronounced him the world's richest man, estimating his personal net worth at <MONEY>$25 billion</MONEY> or more. 
The sultan, who rules <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, a tiny country on the oil-rich island of <LOCATION>Borneo</LOCATION>, lives in a 1,788-room palace and owns more than 200 polo ponies, according to the story. 

   The sultan couldn't be reached for comment. 

   The hotel wouldn't be the sultan's first. 
He snapped up <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s elegant <LOCATION>Dorchester</LOCATION> Hotel 2 1/2 years ago for a price that wasn't disclosed from <ORGANIZATION>Regent International Hotels</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>. 
A hotel spokeswoman at the time said the price paid was "certainly in excess" of the <MONEY>$52 million</MONEY> that <ORGANIZATION>Regent</ORGANIZATION> had paid for the <LOCATION>Hyde Park</LOCATION> property less than a year earlier. 

   The sultan entered the national spotlight earlier this year when the congressional investigation into the Iran-Contra affair revealed that he had contributed <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> to the Contra rebels at the request of the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration. 
That contribution was eventually returned to the Sultan after it was deposited in the wrong Swiss bank account.

<HEAD>Biggest Fortune is Built On Milk Carton</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>'s biggest private fortune was
built on a better milk carton, according to a new survey of wealth
in a country that discourages high incomes.
   The survey, published <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> by Affarsvarlden (Business
World), showed the four wealthiest families have left <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> and
relocated their companies abroad to avoid a tax system designed to
equalize personal income.
   However, the magazine said its list of multimillionaires has
grown from 26 to 163 since its first survey six years ago.
   Thirty-one families were listed as having assets worth more than
<MONEY>one billion kronor</MONEY>. Three families would qualify as billionaires in
dollars. A dollar is worth just under six krona.
   The wealthiest family is headed by <PERSON>Hans</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gad Rausing</PERSON>, the
sons of <PERSON>Ruben Rousing</PERSON> who began producing milk cartons in <DATE>1952</DATE>, and
in <DATE>1963</DATE> gave the world a flat-topped carton that can be packed and
shipped like bricks.
   <PERSON>Tetra Pak</PERSON>, the company at the base of the family fortune, has
its head office in <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>. The Rousing brothers, said the
magazine, are worth up to <MONEY>30 billion kronor</MONEY>, or <MONEY>$5 billion</MONEY>.
   Second on the list is the family of Ingvar Kamprad who founded
<ORGANIZATION>IKEA</ORGANIZATION>, a chain store selling cheap do-it-yourself furniture and
accessories.
   <PERSON>Peter Wallenberg</PERSON>, head of <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>'s best known industrial family,
ranked 64th on the list. One distant relative was <PERSON>Raoul Wallenberg</PERSON>,
the diplomat who saved 100.000 Hungarian Jews from Nazi
extermination camps during World War II. He was arrested by the
Soviet army during final days of the war and disappeared.
   King <PERSON>Carl XVI Gustaf</PERSON> just squeezed onto the list in 158th place
with estimated assets of about 100 million kronor, or <MONEY>$16.6 million</MONEY>.
   <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>'s newest billionaire is Per Arwidsson, 35, who took a
small loan from a bank eight years ago and parlayed it into a
fortune on the stock market, the magazine said. He was 31st on the
list.
   Senior Editor <PERSON>Bjorn Franzon</PERSON> said the list was difficult to
compile fairly. ``We tried to evaluate the market value of the
family holdings in listed companies,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION>Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The situation is a little tricky. We are talking about family
equity because we don't care if the owner has transferred some or
all of his shares to one son or five sons ... for tax purposes,''
said <PERSON>Franzon</PERSON>.
   Most Swedes pay about half their wages in taxes, and the
marginal tax rate on top income brackets goes up to <PERCENT>75 percent</PERCENT>.
Inheritance tax can amount to <PERCENT>100 percent</PERCENT>, and even more, of an
estate.
   Franzon said the magazine's first survey of the super-rich was
in <DATE>1982</DATE> when the Social Democrats, who ran <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> for 50 years,
were returned to power after six years of non-socialist government.
   The quantum leap in the length of the list was only partly due
to the government's economic policy, he said.
   That policy encourages business profits while heavily taxing
private income. Employee benefits and tax-financed government
welfare programs give Swedish workers one of the world's highest
standards of living.
   The growing number of millionaires could be attributed to a real
estate and stock market boom, despite the crash last <DATE>October</DATE>, and
by inflation, which pushed up the nominal value of the companies,
<PERSON>Franzon</PERSON> said.
   He acknowledged his earlier list was not as accurate as it
should have been.
   ``I'm a little ashamed to say that our journalism also is
better. We have better resources ... and a better understanding of
the companies,'' he said.
   ``We have 40 or 50 people on the list this time who should have
been on before, but it wasn't possible to find them,'' the editor
added.
   Antonia Ax:son-Johnson, 45, is the only woman listed as head of
a wealthy family, with assets of up to <MONEY>2.4 billion kronor</MONEY>, or <MONEY>$400
million</MONEY>. She spells her name in a disappearing form of Swedish
abreviation, but the company she inherited is known as
<ORGANIZATION>Axelson-Johnson AB</ORGANIZATION>, a trading and investment firm which last month
<LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>'s largest department store chain to its holdings.
   Franzon said the list is still incomplete, and the magazine has
more to learn. ``My guess is that an accurate list should have many
more real estate people,'' he said.
   Affarsvarlden, a weekly first published in <DATE>1901</DATE>, has a
circulation of 25,000.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Despatches: Dinner for 5,750 please, James - Brunei / Kieran
Cooke sups with a sultan but finds the six-hour wait tedious
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE richest man in the world issues a dinner invitation, it is best to
be punctual. The sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, estimated to be worth a cool Dollars 37bn
(Pounds 20.7bn) at the last count, was throwing a little anniversary bash
marking his 25 years on the throne.
Dinner was at 7.30. At 5.30, a few select members of the international media
arrived at the palace gates. The sultan is known to be a bit of a stickler
when it comes to dress. Slept-in suits were brushed down. Scuffed shoes were
given a quick wipe. Stained ties were adjusted. The man from Russian TV
looked in need of a snort of vodka.
It was going to be a cosy affair. Just us, the sultan, a sprinkling of Malay
royalty, a layer of heads of state, a few prime ministers added as garnish.
Plus a few thousand other dignitaries, even a few ordinary people. A mere
5,750 altogether, all seated in the same room.
You either hide your wealth or flaunt it. Sultan <PERSON>Hassanal Bolkiah</PERSON>, 29th
sultan and absolute ruler of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, is not afraid of spending a bob or two.
His palace is described as the biggest in the world. There are nearly 2,000
rooms. There is a throne room that can seat 2,000. Marble covers more than
12 acres of wall. Carpets as lush as newly-fallen snow. Chandeliers that
weigh a ton apiece. Gold that hurts the eyes. Nearly 300 lavatories.
The meal was running late. No one can raise a fork until the sultan gives
the word. We waited. The dining room was a cross between <LOCATION>Versailles</LOCATION> and high
season at Butlins.
'G'day,' said an Australian waiter, one of more than 700 catering staff
flown in for the occasion. 'Not a bad little party, eh?'
In the kitchens, chefs sweltered and tempers frayed. Plates of prawns
collided with sides of mutton. The meat for the meal was flown in from
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> where the sultan's ranch is twice the size of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> itself.
More waiting. A few of the down top table guests sloped in. Prince <PERSON>Edward</PERSON> -
representing his mother, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON> - sat in the corner by
the royal serving hatch. A Thai prince smiled serenely at the ceiling. A
Malay princess adjusted a troublesome tiara.
The sultan, still only in his mid-40s, has two wives and 10 children. And a
great deal else besides. Two palaces in <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> plus a hotel in <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> and
another which he bought, then sold, to the <ORGANIZATION>Brunei Investment Agency</ORGANIZATION> (BIA), a
secretive organisation that handles an estimated Dollars 35bn of the
country's international investments.
The sultan has a mansion in <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>. He owns the <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION> hotel in the
<LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, plus another couple of houses in <LOCATION>Tinseltown</LOCATION>.
His father was something of an anglophile who even had a special <ORGANIZATION>Winston
Churchill</ORGANIZATION> museum built in <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>. That has been closed but the present
sultan - who spent time at <LOCATION>Sandhurst</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>'s military college for
officers - still maintains strong British links.
He bought the <LOCATION>Dorchester</LOCATION> hotel in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> but sold it recently to the <ORGANIZATION>BIA</ORGANIZATION>.
There are various flats and houses dotted round the British capital. The
sultan's main residence is a country house situated on the flight path to
<LOCATION>Heathrow</LOCATION> airport.
The sultan is partial to planes. He bought his own 747 recently and has a
couple of other jets in <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>. Then there are the automobiles: estimates of
the number of his Rolls-Royces vary between 135 and 157. Plus a whole
starting grid of sports cars.
Dinner was getting very late. There were ugly mutterings from the
international press. No alcohol allowed in this increasingly Islamic state.
Diplomats, dressed in their full regalia, perspired quietly; their wives
glowed.
The sultan loves polo. He flies in whole teams to play special tournaments.
His horses are said to have air-conditioned stables.
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> has a battalion of Gurkhas stationed in <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>. The sultan has his
own Gurkha battalion, made up of retired soldiers who now form the palace
guard. Any mutinous sounds from the waiting diners and the kukris might be
out.
Army chaps were the only ones to maintain stiff upper lips throughout the
long wait. They would not even taste a tumbler of water until the sultan -
always referred-to among expatriates as 'HRH' - had first lifted a glass.
It was 9.45 pm when the sultan finally arrived. The whole family was in
attendance. The sultan doubles up as prime minister and minister of defence.
A brother is foreign minister, another is minister of finance.
Sultan, princes, princesses and prime ministers sat down, stock still. Not a
word was spoken. Just the sound of a thousand camera shutters clicking.
The press were ordered back to table. The sultan had given the word. Food
was fallen on. The Russian fantasised about the cold of a <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> winter.
'And then you drink - like that,' he said, knocking back a pineapple juice.
We rose. 'Tut, tut,' said the army. Dammit all, everyone has to wait till
<ORGANIZATION>HRH</ORGANIZATION> has finished. We escaped through the kitchens.
'You people have no bloody decorum,' said the Australian waiter, smiling. We
agreed. Six hours of dinner was enough, even if it was with the richest man
in the world.

BEST-SELLING AUTHOR BARBARA TAYLOR BRADFORD LIVES THE GLAMOROUS LIFESTYLE OF 
HER CHARACTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH VENANT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Facing her well-stocked closet, <PERSON>Barbara Taylor Bradford</PERSON> is caught in a small, 
pleasurable dilemma: What to wear for the evening's dinner party -- the 
elegantly tailored dress designed by a <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> couturier, or the flirtatious 
red-skirted ensemble by her favorite <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> designer? 
</P>
<P>
The multimillion-dollar author is deliberating over this embarrassment of 
riches in the living room of her bungalow at the <ORGANIZATION>Beverly Hills Hotel</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of her latest best seller, her publisher, <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION>, has 
flown her here on a VIP publicity trip. Her husband, producer <PERSON>Robert Bradford</PERSON>, 
who has transformed all but one of her novels into television miniseries, has 
jetted out to be by her side. Her personal publicist is on hand. And a press 
packet has been prepared, extolling her books' vital statistics: more than 30 
million copies sold in English-language editions and publication in 34 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
A household word in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, the British author of romance novels is also 
building her name -- and her fortune -- in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, where she has 
lived for more than 26 years. In an industry dominated by deep-pocketed 
corporations, <PERSON>Bradford</PERSON> is a guaranteed money-maker with whom publishers are 
making record-setting mega-deals. 
</P>
<P>
Her present book, "The Women in His Life," jumped into the No. 1 slot on 
British best-seller lists mere days behind the novel's <DATE>June</DATE> publication date. 
In a review of the book, the British newspaper the <ORGANIZATION>Evening Standard</ORGANIZATION>, noted, 
"While 'The Women in His Life' lacks the page-turning intensity of, for 
instance, 'A Woman of Substance,' the tightly knit plot is splendidly 
sustained." 
</P>
<P>
Appearing in bookstores <DATE>last Thursday</DATE> in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, the work is the 
first product of a <MONEY>$10-million</MONEY> three-book contract, engineered by literary 
agent <PERSON>Morton Janklow</PERSON>. <PERSON>Janklow</PERSON>, who represents such authors as <PERSON>Jackie Collins</PERSON>, 
<PERSON>Judith Krantz</PERSON> and <PERSON>Danielle Steele</PERSON>, named his take-it-or-leave-it price to the 
publishers -- "no negotiations," <PERSON>Bradford</PERSON> says. And that was for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and 
Canadian rights only. 
</P>
<P>
"The rest of the world is mine," <PERSON>Bradford</PERSON> says with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
The author is sitting on the bungalow's peach brocade couch (her favorite 
color) in a room fresh with flowers. At 57, <PERSON>Bradford</PERSON> is a handsome woman, 
coiffed and dressed with impeccable English order. Living the world-scale 
glamour her novels portray ("I write about places I know"), she unabashedly 
loves clothes, fine antiques, handsome men and expensive hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Her style is chit-chatty (she has a small chipped tooth, a wonderful Romanian 
manicurist and plans to redecorate her kitchen and dining room next year) and 
alternately decisive, in the manner of <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON>, whom she much 
admires. Her conversation is heavily referenced with the names of the rich and 
powerful: her friend <PERSON>Hannah Pakula</PERSON>, director <PERSON>Alan Pakula</PERSON>'s wife, who wrote 
about <PERSON>Elena Ceausescu</PERSON> in Vanity Fair; <LOCATION>Queen Elizabeth</LOCATION>'s cousin, <PERSON>Lord Lichfield</PERSON>, 
who took her portrait, bedecked in emeralds, for her new novel's dust jacket; 
publishing magnate <PERSON>Rupert Murdoch</PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON>Anna</PERSON>; Spanish singer <PERSON>Julio 
Iglesias</PERSON> and, last but not least, the loyal steed of her world travels, the 
Concorde. (It bore her home from <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> <DATE>two years ago</DATE> when her fluffy white 
bichon frise, <ORGANIZATION>Gemmy</ORGANIZATION>, became temporarily paralyzed.) 
</P>
<P>
She and and her husband have just returned from a vacation in <LOCATION>St. 
Jean-Cap-Ferrat</LOCATION> on <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s Cote d'Azur, which followed a three-week 
promotional tour through <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>. Relaxed, <PERSON>Bradford</PERSON> is again ready to talk 
about "The Women in His Life." 
</P>
<P>
The set piece of the room's coffee table, the book shimmers in its red jacket, 
with the author's name in "lapis royal blue purple," as <ORGANIZATION>Bradford</ORGANIZATION> describes it. 
She set out to re-create the colors from the packaging and graphics of <PERSON>Giorgio 
Beverly Hills</PERSON>' perfume Red, she says. 
</P>
<P>
" 'I want it to be packaged like cosmetics,' I told (<ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> publisher) 
<PERSON>Joni Evans</PERSON>. 'I want it to have that look that somebody wants to reach for it.' 
Packaging is so important in selling perfume." 
</P>
<P>
But the principal reason that her books sell well is, as she states, "that I'm 
a brand name. When a book comes out, they grab it." 
</P>
<P>
The story now up for grabs is a departure from her panoramic sagas centered on 
strong-willed women, which began with her blockbuster, "A Woman of Substance," 
published in <DATE>1979</DATE>. In "The Women in His Life," <PERSON>Bradford</PERSON> tells the tale of 
<PERSON>Maximilian West</PERSON> as his life sweeps by those of his mother, his nanny, and a 
trio of wives. A beautiful billionaire corporate raider, <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> is "power 
personified," a man who dashes about a world staged with marble mansions, women 
ready for seduction and corporations ripe for takeover. In a "This Is Your 
Life" ending, <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> comes to his senses, pleading in a post-epiphanic cri de 
coeur, "No more champagne"; he takes brandy instead. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the book's subject matter accurately reflects the author's 
interests. "I think finance is fascinating," <PERSON>Bradford</PERSON> says. "That's why I made 
'<ORGANIZATION>Maxim</ORGANIZATION>' a tycoon. Business and money interest me. Not money in the sense of 
something to spend, but as a monetary unit, a tool of industry." 
</P>
<P>
Utilizing historical drama, the book's action progresses from <LOCATION>Kristallnacht</LOCATION>, 
the first of the Nazi pogroms, on <DATE>Nov. 9, 1938</DATE>, to the dismantling of the 
<LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> <DATE>Wall 51 years later</DATE>. At its most informative, the novel recounts 
resistance to Hitler in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s upper social ranks and <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>'s (shortened from 
<LOCATION>Westheim</LOCATION>) childhood escape from the country, which is loosely based on 
<ORGANIZATION>Bradford</ORGANIZATION>'s husband's experiences as a German Jew fleeing <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
A supporter of a strong <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> functioning within a European political 
framework, <PERSON>Bradford</PERSON> declares, "They've spent 45 years trying to expiate their 
crime. The Nazis only wanted power for the sake of having power; they didn't 
want it for economics. <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> is going to be the most dominant country in 
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, but not necessarily warlike." 
</P>
<P>
With the major exception of a nurturing nanny (<ORGANIZATION>Bradford</ORGANIZATION>'s mother was a nanny 
before she married), the novel is less supportive of women, often depicting 
them as frivolous, (two <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> working women are shown as egregious new-rich 
hustlers) and it assumes an ethical allegiance to the monied class. 
</P>
<P>
"The book has no message," <PERSON>Bradford</PERSON> says, adding: "It's a book people can read 
quite easily. I work very hard to make it easy to read, without descending into 
an infantile prose style." 
</P>
<P>
As for literature in general, she says, "You tell me someone who's writing 
literature today and I'll go buy the book." 
</P>
<P>
Examples are given. 
</P>
<P>
"But how many people read them?" she ask. 
</P>
<P>
Bradford's own desire to be a novelist began when she was a child growing up in 
<LOCATION>Leeds</LOCATION>, in the industrial north of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>. The daughter of a machinery 
engineer, she says she was both spoiled and driven to make a success of 
herself. She sold her first short story at the age of 12 and later bypassed 
college to get on with a career as a journalist, working for a year as fashion 
editor of Woman's Own, a popular women's magazine, and interviewing celebrities 
for the large-circulation evening paper, the <ORGANIZATION>London Evening News</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
After her marriage, she moved to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> in <DATE>1964</DATE>, and for 12 years wrote a 
syndicated newspaper column on interior design. Following four attempts at 
writing suspense novels, she turned to the saga, finding immediate success with 
"A Woman of Substance." In this best seller, <PERSON>Bradford</PERSON>'s heroine, <PERSON>Emma Harte</PERSON>, 
rises from poverty in a small <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> town to become the head of an 
international merchandising empire and one of the world's wealthiest women. 
</P>
<P>
Bradford resents press correlations of her frequently termed "rags-to-Vuitton" 
rise with that of <PERSON>Emma Harte</PERSON>. She says she "loathes" a profile published 
recently in the <DATE>Sunday</DATE> Times, which mentions "childhood deprivation" and 
describes her father as a "wooden-legged" former soldier. "His leg was made of 
aluminum," <PERSON>Bradford</PERSON> corrects, saying: "I come from an ordinary middle-class 
family." 
</P>
<P>
Like <PERSON>Harte</PERSON>, however, she admits she is a workhorse who starts at sunup and puts 
in 12-hour days in her office, which is decorated like a library, she says. Two 
walls of books contain such favorite novelists as <ORGANIZATION>Irwin Shaw</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>James Clavell</PERSON>, 
as well as <PERSON>Charles Dickens</PERSON>, the <PERSON>Bronte</PERSON> sisters and a biography of <ORGANIZATION>Winston 
Churchill</ORGANIZATION>. Her typing table is custom-made to blend with her Victorian desk; 
the walls are pale yellow, the carpet fir green, the sofa and ballon curtains 
done in flowered chintz, she says. 
</P>
<P>
She will be returning to their <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> apartment ("47th floor overlooking the 
East River"), while her husband is off to <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> to begin filming a TV 
miniseries of "To Be the Best," the last novel in the <LOCATION>Harte</LOCATION> trilogy. Before 
beginning her next book in the <DATE>fall</DATE>, <PERSON>Bradford</PERSON> plans to take the rest of the 
<DATE>summer</DATE> off. 
</P>
<P>
There will be time for lunch dates with pals such as <PERSON>Fran Weissler</PERSON> (Broadway 
producer with her husband, <PERSON>Barry</PERSON>, of "Gypsy" and "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," she 
notes) at restaurants such Le Cirque, the Russian Tea Room, and, she says after 
a second's consideration, "maybe some little place."

   Warplanes rumble overhead. Bombs whistle down and
explode, shaking the floor. Thick smoke wafts over the wreckage and
a woman's screams mingle with the reassuring tones of a Cockney air
raid warden.
   It's ``The Blitz Experience,'' a vivid museum display that gives
post-World War II generations a taste of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> under German
bombardment.
   As those who lived through the 1940-42 bombing of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> can
attest, ``The Blitz Experience'' is unnerving. The smoke smells
real, the ground really does shake, and the sounds are authentic
wartime recordings.
   ``The Blitz Experience,'' the centerpiece of the Imperial War
Museum's <MONEY>$31 million</MONEY> redevelopment, begins in a brick shelter like
those in which thousands of Britons cowered during air raids.
   For seven minutes, mostly in chilly darkness when the single
storm lantern is blown out, visitors listen to a raid launched in
the <DATE>fall of 1940</DATE>.
   ``If you lived in our street you'd have been in here, 12 hours a
night, <TIME>night after night</TIME>,'' says the recorded voice of <PERSON>George
Barker</PERSON>, a Cockney grocer who doubled as an air raid warden,
patrolling the streets in a tin hat, and who lost his shop to a bomb.
   There are moments of humor, in tribute to the legendary spirit of
the Londoners under siege, such as <PERSON>Barker</PERSON> remarking that a shop
whose front was blown up ``put out this big sign. Know what it says?
`More open than usual.'''
   Those on the recording sing ``Roll out the Barrel,'' breaking off
as a woman screams when a bomb explodes close by.
   When the all-clear siren sounds, <PERSON>Barker</PERSON> ushers everyone out,
saying: ``Let's see what <PERSON>Jerry</PERSON>'s (the Germans) left us.''
   A man named <PERSON>Albert</PERSON>, who disdains the shelter and ``always sleeps
behind the bar,'' groans in the wreckage of his pub but is pulled
out alive.
   The <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> skyline is red with fire, an unexploded bomb lies
nearby, the firefighters are running out of water.
   ``Our house _ it ain't there,'' a woman says.
   A little boy hunts for his toys. His mother is heard coaxing him
away from the wreckage, promising him new toys.
   ``It's our job to make the terror, the horror and the sacrifice
as real to people who, we hope, will never experience it as those
who did,'' said the museum's director, <PERSON>Alan Borg</PERSON>.
   The Blitz, he said, has been mythologized by nostalgia. ``It
wasn't fun, and one of the aims of our experience is to show that it
must have been a terrifying thing to live through,'' he said.
   ``It's no good being serious and boring about it and saying
`you've got to listen to me!' I've got to get people in and say,
`this is interesting, come and see!' And then hopefully they'll
think about it.''
   Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth II</PERSON>, who served in the wartime <ORGANIZATION>Auxiliary
Territorial Service</ORGANIZATION> and whose <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> home was bombed in
<DATE>1940</DATE>, will visit ``The Blitz Experience'' <DATE>Thursday</DATE> when she
officially opens the redeveloped museum.
   The museum arose from a government decision in <DATE>March 1917</DATE> to
collect and display material from World War I.
   It is housed _ appropriately, some say _ in the building that was
the <DATE>19th century</DATE> mental hospital known as <LOCATION>Bedlam</LOCATION>.
   Its extraordinary relics include caltrops, a sabotage instrument
with four spikes used by the ancient Romans and resurrected in World
War I to damage the feet of men and horses.
   Besides little tins labeled ``Queen <PERSON>Mary</PERSON>'s Comforts for the
Troops'' from World War I _ needles and cotton, cigarettes and candy
_ there are guns and gas masks, tanks and two-man submarines,
uniforms and medals, fighter planes suspended from the ceiling,
100,000 books and the world's best war art collection of 12,000
paintings and drawings.
   Next year, it plans to open ``The Trench Experience,'' which will
expose visitors to the mud and smells of a World War I fighting
front.

CAROLINE HUNT'S SOURED INVESTMENT; 
</P>
<P>
WEALTH: ONE OF THE NATION'S RICHEST WOMEN HAS LOST A BUNDLE ON STOCK IN FIRST 
EXECUTIVE. NOW HER TRUST IS BIDDING FOR THE LOS ANGELES INSURANCE COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. MICHAEL KENNEDY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For much of her 66 years, <PERSON>Caroline Rose Hunt</PERSON>, one of the nation's wealthiest 
women, focused her attention on doing good works and raising five children. 
More often than not, she shunned the spotlight that was hers for the asking, 
merely by virtue of being one of the Hunt dynasty of <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
It was only in the <DATE>last decade</DATE>, when she took an interest in the buying and 
promotion of luxury hotels -- including the <ORGANIZATION>Bel-Air Hotel</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> -- 
that her name began to appear not only in the society columns but also the 
business pages. 
</P>
<P>
Her name has again come to the fore recently with an offer by a unit of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Caroline Hunt Trust Estate</ORGANIZATION> to purchase controversial <ORGANIZATION>First Executive Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the 
Los Angeles-based life insurance concern best known for its huge junk bond 
holdings. The offer expired this week without a response from <ORGANIZATION>First Executive</ORGANIZATION>, 
but another offer is widely expected. 
</P>
<P>
First Executive's stock plunged last month after the company announced that it 
would take a <MONEY>$515-million</MONEY> charge against earnings to account for the declining 
value of its junk bond portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts have said the bid by the <PERSON>Caroline Trust</PERSON>, as it is known, is an effort 
to bolster public confidence in the struggling company. (One condition of the 
offer was that <ORGANIZATION>First Executive</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, <PERSON>Fred Carr</PERSON>, would have to resign from 
the company.) <ORGANIZATION>Rosewood Financial Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, one of five corporations within the 
trust, owns almost <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>First Executive</ORGANIZATION>'s common stock. 
</P>
<P>
While <PERSON>Caroline Hunt</PERSON>'s name is on the trust, executives within Rosewood and 
outside analysts portray her role in setting investment strategy as almost 
negligible. 
</P>
<P>
"She's not a part of making those decisions," said <PERSON>Charles Tusa</PERSON>, a senior vice 
president of <ORGANIZATION>Rosewood</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Robert D. Zimmerman</PERSON>, who was in charge of the trust's hotel management branch 
for 10 years before leaving last year to form his own company, said, "She lets 
her companies run themselves with her people, including family members, in on 
the decision making." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bruce Benteman</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Wealth Monitors</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mo.</LOCATION>, investment firm that 
tracks the portfolios of the nation's wealthiest people, said <PERSON>Hunt</PERSON>'s style when 
it comes to the trust is to keep it at arm's distance. She is not even a member 
of the advisory board that runs it. Her presence is felt, though, by the fact 
that her children are involved in the trust's activities, particularly her 
oldest son, <PERSON>Stephen Sands</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"She surrounds herself with good people," <PERSON>Benteman</PERSON> said. "They are the best 
that money can buy." 
</P>
<P>
But the trust may have "stubbed its toe" by investing so heavily in <ORGANIZATION>First 
Executive</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Benteman</PERSON> said, and it now appeared to be trying to bail out the 
ailing company by making the purchase offer. (<ORGANIZATION>Rosewood</ORGANIZATION> originally invested 
about <MONEY>$103 million</MONEY> in First Executive stock, but at current prices the stake is 
worth only about <MONEY>$27.5 million</MONEY>.) 
</P>
<P>
On balance, though, it is difficult to argue with <PERSON>Caroline Hunt</PERSON>'s policy of 
letting others manage her fortune, though the downturn in oil and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> real 
estate is sure to have had a negative effect on the trust. 
</P>
<P>
She is regularly ranked as one of the wealthiest women in the nation. And while 
her brothers -- <PERSON>Nelson Bunker</PERSON>, <PERSON>William Herbert</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lamar</PERSON> -- retain only a 
fraction of what was one of the largest fortunes in the world before their 
adventures in attempting to corner the silver market a decade ago, <PERSON>Caroline 
Hunt</PERSON> remains a perennial entry on any list of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s richest people. Forbes 
magazine last year estimated her worth at <MONEY>$800 million</MONEY>, including the assets of 
the trust. 
</P>
<P>
The second daughter of famed wildcatter <PERSON>H. L. Hunt</PERSON>, she is known as the kind of 
woman who prunes her own trees, cooks her own dinner and enjoys finding a 
bargain when she is shopping for clothes. The author of a book of pumpkin 
recipes, she was once asked by the <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> Morning News whom she most resembled. 
</P>
<P>
"People say <PERSON>Mary Martin</PERSON>. I say thank you," she replied. A graduate of <ORGANIZATION>Mary 
Baldwin College</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, she married a <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> pilot, <PERSON>Lloyd Sands</PERSON>. While he 
was off in World War II, she worked first in her father's <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> office, then 
as a sales clerk at the <ORGANIZATION>Neiman Marcus</ORGANIZATION> department store. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had five children before they divorced in <DATE>1973</DATE> and she married <PERSON>Buddy 
Schoellkopf</PERSON>, who came from a prominent <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> family. They too were later 
divorced. 
</P>
<P>
The entry into the hotel business began in <DATE>1979</DATE>, when her children bought a 
rundown mansion in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> and spent <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY> for a nine-story hotel building 
next to it. Today, the <ORGANIZATION>Mansion on Turtle Creek</ORGANIZATION> is considered one of <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>' 
finest. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt had in the past left most of the dealings of the trust to others, but the 
hotel business seemed to attract her interest. The construction of the tony 
<ORGANIZATION>Remington Hotel</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, the purchase of the Bel-Air and the <ORGANIZATION>Hotel Hana-Maui</ORGANIZATION> 
in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> followed over the next five years, as did the building of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Crescent Court Hotel</ORGANIZATION> near downtown <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>. While the trust handled the 
purchases, <PERSON>Hunt</PERSON> lent her name to the projects as a representative of the trust. 
</P>
<P>
"Business activities and publicizing are two different things," said <PERSON>Tusa</PERSON>. 
"She's been a tremendous help in that area." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the hotel investments of the trust have been pared back by more 
than half. Both the <LOCATION>Bel-Air</LOCATION> and the Hana-Maui hotels were sold last year for 
staggering profits, and the <LOCATION>Remington</LOCATION> was disposed of in <DATE>1985</DATE>. There have been 
persistent rumors that the hotels were sold to give the trust a cash infusion 
because of losses in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at the real estate market and oil, you have to put that together," 
said <PERSON>Zimmerman</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Life Styles of the Rich and Famous:
Christmas Books: A Holiday Sampler
---
By Raymond Sokolov</HL>
<DD> 12/16/86</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   The rich are richer than you or me. 
They aren't afraid of looking ostentatious either. 
As unabashed as <PERSON>Marie Antoinette</PERSON>, they let the readers of Town and Country eat lavish slices of their opulent lives in <LOCATION>Palm Beach</LOCATION>. 
This year, you could read about the very newly arrived and preposterously luxurious life of the designer <PERSON>Carolyne Roehm</PERSON> in the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Times, <LOCATION>New York Magazine</LOCATION> and other centers of modern morality without ever coming across the phrase nouveau riche. 
So let's not be stuffy this Yule. 
Let's push our noses against the aquarium glass and watch the big resplendent fish of this and other days glide through their gilded halls, unblushing, acquisitive, "sportif," fur-lined and fun. 
You don't even have to leave your own undistinguished, unphotographable living room to do it. 
Just buy one of these books, or, better yet, give them to friends you want to put politely in their place. 

   ---
   Even if they have a yacht, its unlikely theirs will be as nice as the boats in <PERSON>Jill Bobrow</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dana Jinkins</PERSON>'s "The World's Most Extraordinary Yachts" (<ORGANIZATION>Norton</ORGANIZATION>, 221 pages, <MONEY>$50</MONEY>). 
My favorite is "Nabila," a "self-sufficient island" that belongs to the <LOCATION>Saudi</LOCATION> businessman <PERSON>Adnan Khashoggi</PERSON>. 
At 281 feet in length, it isn't quite as big as <ORGANIZATION>Queen Elizabeth</ORGANIZATION>'s Britannia (412 feet), but it has a few features Her Majesty might envy, including a small screening room with 1,500 films and cashmere blankets to snuggle under. 
<PERSON>Mr. Khashoggi</PERSON> can choose from among 280 telephones to conduct business while afloat, and if he should tire of haggling about, say, the price of missile launchers on the international market, he can slope off to the blue suede and gold lame pillows of <ORGANIZATION>Nabila</ORGANIZATION>'s discotheque. 
Not just for show, however, the ship has a crew of 50, its own operating room, and earned a bit of its keep as a set for the James Bond film "Never Say Never Again." 

   ---
   For the landlubbers in your set, the odds-on favorite is "The Majestic World of Arabian Horses" (<ORGANIZATION>Abrams</ORGANIZATION>, 213 pages, <MONEY>$60</MONEY>) by <PERSON>William L. Pereira Jr.</PERSON>, photographs by <PERSON>Martin H. Schreiber</PERSON>. 
Though it comes from a publisher known for art books, this is not just a collection of pretty pictures of graceful descendants of the Godolphin Arabian (1724-1753), pictured here in a posthumous painting done by <PERSON>George Stubbs</PERSON> in <DATE>1792</DATE>. 
The most romantic of all horse breeds is beautiful, but it also has a history. 
After mythic beginnings in <LOCATION>Araby</LOCATION>, the tale moves to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and in particular to <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>, yes <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>, where Czar Alexander I established a stud in <DATE>1817</DATE> at <ORGANIZATION>Janow Podlaski</ORGANIZATION>. 
Polish Arabians snorted futile defiance at the advancing Nazi hordes in <DATE>1939</DATE>, as Polish cavalry mounts. 
The stud survived the war much depleted, but it has rebounded and now supplies stock to capitalist fanciers at one of the world's great horseflesh auctions, well attended by rich Americans and conducted in English. 
Hard cash only, no zlotys accepted. 

   ---
   Rich people also like to spend time inside at the table. 
And they can afford to have other people polish their silver collections. 
At least one cannot imagine that the <PERSON>Baron</PERSON> and <PERSON>Baroness Thyssen-Bornemisza</PERSON> have the time to look after all the extraordinary pieces that are scattered about the rooms of their <ORGANIZATION>Villa Favorita</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Lugano</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>, or at <ORGANIZATION>Daylesford House</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Gloucestershire</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>. 
Normally, these intricately sculptural cups and tankards and plates are not shown to the visiting public. 
And most of us will not see them on exhibit next fall in the <LOCATION>U.S.S.R.</LOCATION> 
So "European Silver: The Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection" (<ORGANIZATION>Vendome</ORGANIZATION>, 311 pages, <MONEY>$95</MONEY>) by <PERSON>Hannelore Mueller</PERSON> is the place to look if you want to see how a table setting really ought to be. 
Perhaps the greatest of the <ORGANIZATION>Thyssen</ORGANIZATION> treasures is a rococo traveling service of 53 gilded silver items made in <LOCATION>Augsburg</LOCATION> around 1750. 
More humble in its fabulous way is a 17th-century "tortoise flask," also from <LOCATION>Augsburg</LOCATION>. 
A flat silver bottle is the tortoise's body; its shell is the natural shell of a Greek tortoise. 
The learned author remarks accurately on the "alert appearance of the animal with its watchful eyes." 

   ---
   Splendid as this and the rest of the <ORGANIZATION>Thyssen</ORGANIZATION> holdings are, no collection formed as recently as theirs with a mere German heavy industrial fortune can match the treasures contained in the <ORGANIZATION>Topkapi Saray Museum</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Istanbul</LOCATION>. 
There, in the former palace enclosure of the <ORGANIZATION>Ottoman Empire</ORGANIZATION>, the ruling sultans amassed everything from rugs to scimitars for six centuries. 
The first two of a projected five volumes have now appeared: "The Topkapi Saray Museum: Costume, Embroideries and other Textiles" and "Manuscripts" (<ORGANIZATION>New York Graphic Society</ORGANIZATION>, 216 and 280 pages, <MONEY>$150</MONEY> each volume), translated, expanded and edited by <PERSON>J.M. Rogers</PERSON> of the British Museum from original Turkish texts by various hands. 

   Sumptuous as objects themselves, these books will introduce most Americans to an unsuspected universe of high accomplishment and delicacy. 
In the textile volume, the embroidered court kaftans in a dozen styles have been photographed flat and unoccupied, making excellent color abstractions on the page. 
The Topkapi library has been legendary in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> since the <ORGANIZATION>Renaissance</ORGANIZATION>. 
Its illustrated manuscripts come not only from the <LOCATION>Near East</LOCATION> but from <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, and other cultures exotic even in <LOCATION>Istanbul</LOCATION>. 
The richness of the classical Ottoman manuscript pictures rivals those from <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Medieval Europe</LOCATION>. 
They are realistic to the point where the painting of Selim II receiving a bowing ambassador in <DATE>1567</DATE> (painted in <DATE>1581</DATE>) can bring the now uninhabited rooms of the <LOCATION>Topkapi</LOCATION> to life for the modern visitor. 

   Future volumes will explore jewelry and metalwork, carpets (Persian and Turkish) and architecture (the harem and other palace buildings). 
But given the price of these books, it might be cheaper to go to the Topkapi itself and wander among the exhibitions, stopping at the parapets to look over the Golden Horn and pretend to be a sultan in the full exercise of unimaginable power. 

   ---
   Not as grand as the Ottomans, but perhaps luckier in the long run, <PERSON>Henriette</PERSON> and <PERSON>Peter Clifford</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Frampton Court</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Gloucestershire</LOCATION>, discovered 300 Victorian flower paintings in their attic in <DATE>1982</DATE>. 
Evidently dismissed as routine amateur work by the <PERSON>Clifford</PERSON> sisters and aunts who made them, they were in fact gorgeous, rare and botanically interesting folk art. 
Collected as "The Frampton Flora" (<ORGANIZATION>Prentice Hall</ORGANIZATION>, 192 pages, <MONEY>$25</MONEY>) by the British nature writer <PERSON>Richard Mabey</PERSON>, the paintings survey plants in the immediate vicinity of the Clifford house, the Vale of <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>, from winsome, leaning yellow common fleabane to a wild raspberry in all stages of development at once, from white flower to heavy hanging red fruit, and with roots exposed. 
The <PERSON>Mabey</PERSON> text is an expert commentary on the science and offers easygoing social and family history as well. 

   The <PERSON>Cliffords</PERSON> epitomize the virtues of the mid-19th-century English countryside. 
They were anything but flashy. 
Their paintings were stitched up in scrapbooks and stowed in the attic almost as soon as they were made, according to <PERSON>Mr. Mabey</PERSON>, who is judging from the remarkable brightness of the colors of the originals. 
The reproductions seem to be more subdued, but they are still most charming, and it is easy to see how this facsimile edition turned into a best seller in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>. 

   ---
   For a pure draught of a completely different, hyperurban, very smart life style, try "The Complete Lyrics of <PERSON>Lorenz Hart</PERSON>" (<ORGANIZATION>Knopf</ORGANIZATION>, 317 pages, <MONEY>$40</MONEY>,), edited by <PERSON>Dorothy Hart</PERSON> and <PERSON>Robert Kimball</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Hart</PERSON> was the poet laureate of the Broadway musical in the greatest era of Broadway theater, which reached its commercial zenith in <DATE>1926</DATE>. 
His words and <PERSON>Richard Rodgers</PERSON>'s music expressed the spirit of the top drawer in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>, the college-educated cleverness that could take pleasure in the internal rhyming of "Caring too much is such/A juvenile fancy" or the joyfully mixed metaphor of "If my heart gets in your hair, You mustn't kick it around." 

   Hart's sister-in-law and <PERSON>Mr. Kimball</PERSON>, the musical-theater historian who previously devoted himself to <PERSON>Cole Porter</PERSON>, have dredged up all the <PERSON>Hart</PERSON> lyrics that industry could locate. 
They believe many songs are still missing. 
Perhaps this is not a full-blown tragedy, since many in this book are less than galvanic, especially without music to go with them. 
Song lyrics go best with songs, but this is still a bracing gust of the cleaner air of a pristine <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>, down whose streets <PERSON>Fred Astaire</PERSON> danced without fear in a spotless tuxedo. 
The nostalgic will also be happy to have the pictures of the <PERSON>Hart</PERSON> shows, including one of <PERSON>Gene Kelly</PERSON> surrounded by showgirls in the original "Pal Joey" of <DATE>1940</DATE> or another of <PERSON>Dennis King</PERSON>, <PERSON>Vera Zorina</PERSON>, <PERSON>Vivienne Segal</PERSON> and <PERSON>Walter Slezak</PERSON> in "I Married an Angel" (<DATE>1938</DATE>). 

   Hart understood all about the surface of wealth, what it could do and what it wasn't. 
In the most glittering language, he serenaded the simple life. 
In the heart of the Depression, he produced "The Lady is a Tramp" (<DATE>1937</DATE>). 
"Social circles spin too fast for me," he wrote, "My Hobohemia is the place to be." 
It is the real American note, slick but not phoney: "I go to opera and stay wide awake" or "I go to <LOCATION>Coney</LOCATION> -- the beach is divine." 
He knew about "life style" before they invented the word. 
But in the end, with all the style a person could hope for, he put the emphasis on the life half: "No dough -- Heigh ho!"

<TEXT>
<P>
When she was a child, she liked to turn cartwheels and be called <PERSON>Sandra</PERSON>, and 
her ambition was to be a circus bareback rider. 
</P>
<P>
She did become an accomplished horsewoman, but these days you don't call her 
anything but "your Royal Highness." Because <PERSON>Alexandra Helen Olga Christabel</PERSON>, 
<ORGANIZATION>Her Royal Highness Princess Alexandra</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Hon. Lady Ogilvy</LOCATION>, GCVO, has a richer 
royal pedigree than the Queen of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
When Princess Alexandra arrives in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> this week to lend the 
British Royal Family's presence to the Festival of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION>, 
residents will get a look at not only the Queen's first -- and favorite -- 
first cousin, but a descendant of <ORGANIZATION>King George V</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>King Edward VII</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Queen 
Victoria</PERSON>, <PERSON>King George</PERSON> I of <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>King Christian IX</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION> and Czar 
Alexander II of <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Though she is unknown to most Americans, <PERSON>Princess Alexandra</PERSON> is considered in 
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> to be one of the most popular and accessible of the royals. She is just 
outside the orbit of the queen's immediate family, but throughout her adult 
life she has taken on the role of what has come to be known as "professional 
princess," representing <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and the Royal Family at official engagements at 
home and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
She wears the royal mantle lightly, however. 
</P>
<P>
She is "easily one of the most popular of the royals, a woman of unstuffy charm 
and classic beauty, regal in presence but highly accessible," author <PERSON>Ralph G. 
Martin</PERSON> wrote in his book "Charles and <PERSON>Diana</PERSON>." 
</P>
<P>
"When she was <PERSON>Diana</PERSON>'s age," <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> wrote, "she was also known as a marvelous 
dancer, a gay conversationalist who loved to laugh, adored children, had a 
craving for sweets and was a ballet addict. Her favorite jazz piece was 'Ain't 
Misbehavin'.' " 
</P>
<P>
However, in her professional role, "she's got an enormous interest in whatever 
she's doing," said Sir <PERSON>Eldon Griffiths</PERSON>, a member of Parliament who lives part 
time in <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION>, lectures at <LOCATION>UC Irvine</LOCATION> and is the president of the county 
office of the <ORGANIZATION>World Affairs Council</ORGANIZATION>. "That's the main thing that comes across. 
She does her homework and she's very well briefed. She, in fact, goes at it 
very hard." 
</P>
<P>
Alexandra's Festival of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> visit will be the first time she has traveled 
to the county, but her brother, the <ORGANIZATION>Duke of Kent</ORGANIZATION>, and his wife were made 
honorary citizens during a <DATE>1985</DATE> visit to dedicate a <LOCATION>Laguna Hills</LOCATION> housing 
project. 
</P>
<P>
The princess visited <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> in <DATE>1971</DATE> in a promotion of British men's wear 
and will return there briefly <DATE>Oct. 15</DATE> and 16 briefly after her Orange County 
visit. Among other things, she will meet with Mayor <PERSON>Tom Bradley</PERSON>, visit <ORGANIZATION>Union 
Avenue Elementary School</ORGANIZATION> and observe a program for mothers of children born 
with a crack addiction at <ORGANIZATION>County Harbor/UCLA Hospital</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Mona Mitchell</PERSON>, the princess' private secretary, said from <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> that <PERSON>Alexandra</PERSON> 
was "delighted" by her last visit to <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> and "thoroughly enjoys 
travel," although her schedule while on tour is always tightly controlled. 
</P>
<P>
That sort of schedule has become meat and potatoes for most members of the 
Royal Family, said <PERSON>John Houlton</PERSON>, a British vice consul based in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"They take their profession quite seriously," he said. "We think the princess 
in a sense serves in an ambassadorial role. She's a figurehead that people are 
interested in meeting." 
</P>
<P>
And it is interesting that in a country of people whose ancestors absolutely 
hated <PERSON>King George III</PERSON>, modern British royals are often received with the sort 
of adulation usually reserved for rock stars. 
</P>
<P>
"In <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Griffiths</PERSON> said, "royalty is a rarity, and its scarcity value 
gives it a much higher profile. There's a curiosity that is much more acute 
here than in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
Mere curiosity, however, does not fully explain the liquid looks that members 
of the British Royal family see turned on them when they come here.

"We find it intriguing too, I have to say, that people in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> -- and in 
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> too, which is also a republic -- are so intrigued," <PERSON>Houlton</PERSON> said. "I 
think that part of it is that the Royal Family are very much a national symbol 
of something that has endured for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
"It has an air of majesty and romance to it. They're a symbol of permanence in 
a rather impermanent world these days. I think that's appealing even to 
countries that have no wish to have a monarchy of their own." 
</P>
<P>
Princess <PERSON>Alexandra</PERSON> has felt the glare of celebrity almost all her life. 
</P>
<P>
Born on <DATE>Christmas Day, 1936</DATE> (her fourth name commemorates her birthday), 
<PERSON>Alexandra</PERSON> is one of three children, and the only daughter, of Prince <PERSON>George</PERSON> and 
Princess <PERSON>Marina</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION> and Duchess of Kent. Her birth, said her grandmother, 
Queen <PERSON>Mary</PERSON>, was "the only nice thing to have happened this year" -- the year of 
the abdication of <ORGANIZATION>Edward VIII</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
She can trace her paternal lineage to Queen <PERSON>Victoria</PERSON> and, on her mother's side, 
to Czar Alexander II of <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> (Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON> is descended from royalty only 
on her father's side). 
</P>
<P>
Alexandra's father, the son of <ORGANIZATION>King George V</ORGANIZATION> and Queen <PERSON>Mary</PERSON>, died in <DATE>1942</DATE> in a 
plane crash on his way to tour <ORGANIZATION>Royal Air Force</ORGANIZATION> bases in <LOCATION>Iceland</LOCATION> during World 
War II. The princess was raised at Coppins, her family's country home in the 
<LOCATION>Buckinghamshire</LOCATION> village of Iver, by her mother, who was a daughter of <PERSON>Prince 
Nicholas</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION> and his wife, the former Grand <PERSON>Duchess Helen</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Although <PERSON>Alexandra</PERSON>'s mother was known as one of the most stylish and glamorous 
royals of her day, she enrolled her daughter as a student at <ORGANIZATION>Heathfield</ORGANIZATION>, an 
exclusive English girls' boarding school -- making <PERSON>Alexandra</PERSON> the first British 
princess to attend a regular school. 
</P>
<P>
She continued her formal education in the <DATE>winter of 1953-54</DATE>, when she attended 
a finishing school in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>. When she returned to <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, she took a nursing 
course at the <ORGANIZATION>Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, where 
she was known simply as <ORGANIZATION>Nurse Kent</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
By the late <DATE>1950s</DATE>, <PERSON>Alexandra</PERSON> had begun to take on more official royal duties, 
but she had also come to be known as an eligible young princess and began to be 
seen more in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> social circles. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Confrey Phillips</PERSON>, a English-born pianist who performs regularly at the <ORGANIZATION>Westin 
South Coast Plaza</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Costa Mesa</LOCATION> and once played in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> hotels and 
nightclubs, remembered that during that time <PERSON>Alexandra</PERSON> was "a very likable 
lady. At that time she was first sort of stepping out. She liked to be with 
friends and have a nice social evening somewhere privately. 
</P>
<P>
"When I had my nightclub in <PERSON>Mayfair</PERSON> (The <ORGANIZATION>Colony</ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION>Berkeley Square</LOCATION>) she'd come 
along with her friends and a couple of times with her husband-to-be, although 
that hadn't been announced at the time. She liked dancing and loved music." 
</P>
<P>
She apparently loved <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON>' music, because <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> said he and his trio 
were hired to play at <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> for the princess' 21st birthday. 
</P>
<P>
"There were about 200 people there," <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> said, "and it was a great 
success, a great party. There was continuous dancing." 
</P>
<P>
The dancing kept up, <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> said, even when his band took a break. A group of 
Princess <PERSON>Alexandra</PERSON>'s friends who were amateur musicians acted as a relief band. 
</P>
<P>
"She's not at all aloof," he said. "She's very relaxed and always has a lovely 
smile and a wonderful soft disposition about her. She's not wet and frumpish, 
like some of these aristocrats can be. She's the least forbidding person you 
could meet." 
</P>
<P>
During the time she knew <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON>, <PERSON>Alexandra</PERSON> also became acquainted with a 
young commoner named <PERSON>Angus Ogilvy</PERSON>. Born in <DATE>1928</DATE>, <PERSON>Ogilvy</PERSON> was the younger son of 
the <ORGANIZATION>Earl of Airlie</ORGANIZATION> and grandson of <ORGANIZATION>Mabell</ORGANIZATION>, Countess of <LOCATION>Airlie</LOCATION>, who was a close 
friend and lady-in-waiting to <PERSON>Alexandra</PERSON>'s grandmother, Queen <PERSON>Mary</PERSON>. After an 
eight-year friendship, the princess and <PERSON>Ogilvy</PERSON> were married in <LOCATION>Westminster 
Abbey</LOCATION> on <DATE>April 24, 1963</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Ogilvy, by his choice, was not catapulted into the aristocratic stratosphere by 
his marriage. When the Queen offered him an earldom (a common practice when a 
princess marries someone of lesser rank), <PERSON>Ogilvy</PERSON> refused. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see why I should get a peerage just because I married a princess," he 
said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Queen did confer a knighthood on <ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1989</DATE>, making him a 
Knight Commander in the Royal Victorian Order. 
</P>
<P>
A businessman who is on the boards of directors of several British companies, 
<ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy</ORGANIZATION> accompanies the princess on many of her trips abroad (he will come with 
her to <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION>) and is properly addressed as Sir <PERSON>Angus</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
The Ogilvys have two children, <PERSON>James Robert Bruce</PERSON>, born in <DATE>1964</DATE> and married to 
<PERSON>Julia Rawlinson</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Marina Victoria Alexandra</PERSON>, born in <DATE>1966</DATE> and married to 
<PERSON>Paul Mowatt</PERSON>. Neither are titled and are not considered to be royal. 
</P>
<P>
Ogilvy once underscored the somewhat hybrid nature of his immediate family by 
referring to its members as "mini-royals." 
</P>
<P>
Alexandra's many tours, duties and appearances entitle her to receive money 
from the Civil List, which is an allowance given to members of the Royal Family 
by Parliament to help pay for staff and expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"Much of the public wrongly assumes that all royals are rich," <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> wrote. 
"Princess Alexandra . . . had no money of her own. Neither did <PERSON>Angus Ogilvy</PERSON>, 
since his older brother inherited both the family title and the family 
fortune." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Griffiths</PERSON> said he believes that the Princess was the first member of the Royal 
Family to drive herself routinely and to ride the Underground rather than be 
chauffeured. (In fact, in <DATE>1962</DATE>, she crashed her <ORGANIZATION>Austin Mini</ORGANIZATION> into a truck on 
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s Kensington High Street. She later admitted that she had been driving a 
bit too fast.) 
</P>
<P>
Alexandra does have an extensive collection of jewels that have come to her 
through her royal relatives. But the woman wearing the gems, so firmly rooted 
in royal tradition, apparently has little use for any pretense that might be 
attached to them. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of the sometimes-stifling pomp associated with royal appearances, 
she has shown a sense of good-humored proportion. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't forget," she said of the Royal Family in the <DATE>1960s</DATE>, "that nowadays we 
have to compete with <PERSON>Elizabeth Taylor</PERSON> and the Beatles."

<HEAD>Poll Says 82 Percent Of Britons Support Monarchy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four out of five Britons remain firmly royalist but
nearly <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> think Queen Elizabeth II should step down to allow
her eldest son Prince <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> to become king, according to an
opinion poll published today.
   The Gallup poll, published in The Daily Telegraph newspaper,
reported <PERCENT>82 percent</PERCENT> of those questioned said they were in favor of
the British monarchy, just <PERCENT>14 percent</PERCENT> wanted it abolished and the
rest expressed no opinion.
   But <PERCENT>59 percent</PERCENT> said they thought the 62-year-old queen should
``retire'' early, allowing 40-year-old Charles to become king.
   Because of the disgrace surrounding the abdication in <DATE>1936</DATE> of the
queen's uncle <PERSON>King Edward VIII</PERSON>, later the <ORGANIZATION>Duke of Windsor</ORGANIZATION>, in order
to marry American divorcee <PERSON>Wallis Simpson</PERSON>, the queen has said she
will never abdicate the throne.
   This could mean a long wait for <PERSON>Charles</PERSON>. His
great-great-grandfather, <ORGANIZATION>King Edward VII</ORGANIZATION>, had to wait until he was
59 years old before he succeeded to the thone in <DATE>1901</DATE> on the death
of his mother, <PERSON>Queen Victoria</PERSON>, at age 81.
   Charles, whose concern for the poor, homeless and what he regards
as the uglier aspects of modern architecture have won him widespread
public support, heads the list of most popular royals, according to
the poll. It said <PERCENT>21 percent</PERCENT> of those questioned said <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> was
their favorite.
   A 75-minute television documentary made by the prince attacking
many modern buildings as ugly was screened by the <ORGANIZATION>British
Broadcasting Corp.</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Oct. 28</DATE>. A newspaper survey at the time said
<PERCENT>75 percent</PERCENT> of Britons agreed with him.
   In today's poll, <PERCENT>19 percent</PERCENT> of respondents said <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON> the
Queen Mother, <PERSON>Charles</PERSON>' 88-year-old grandmother, was their favorite;
<PERCENT>17 percent</PERCENT> favored his 38-year-old sister Princess <PERSON>Anne</PERSON>; <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT>
liked his 27-year-old wife <PERSON>Princess Diana</PERSON> best; and <PERCENT>11 percent</PERCENT> liked
the queen most.
   Despite the overwhelming support for the monarchy, <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> of
presondents said they thought the <MONEY>$9.45 million</MONEY> in taxpayers' money
paid last year to support the royals was too much.
   The queen, one of the world's richest people, has a personal
fortune estimated earlier this year by the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> business
publication <ORGANIZATION>Money Magazine</ORGANIZATION> at <MONEY>$6 billion</MONEY>. But she and some other
royals also receive an annual grant of taxpayers' money voted by
Parliament to help them with the cost of their official duties,
upkeep of palaces and other expenses.
   Asked whether they themselves would want to be members of the
royal family, <PERCENT>89 percent</PERCENT> of those questioned in the poll said no.
   The poll was based on interviews with 918 people around <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.
It stated no margin of error.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Britain's rich see their lives as firmly middle class

<TEXT>
THE WEALTHY go shopping at <ORGANIZATION>Sainsbury</ORGANIZATION>, believe themselves to be excluded from
a <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> or university based upper-class establishment and claim that most
important decisions are taken by men in the family.
The results of a survey of 70 of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s richest families published
yesterday at the <ORGANIZATION>British Association</ORGANIZATION> annual meeting show that many rich
people perceive themselves to be just like everybody else.
<ORGANIZATION>Leicester University</ORGANIZATION>, which published the findings, interviewed with
<LOCATION>Midlands</LOCATION> families deriving fortunes from new and old money. The families,
from landed gentry to captains of industry and commerce, each had at least
Pounds 250,000 in liquid assets. Several were worth tens of millions of
pounds.
Professor <PERSON>John Scott</PERSON>, in charge of the project, said that most of those
interviewed believed themselves to be middle class whatever the size of
their fortune.
Many claimed their biggest extravagance was their weekly <ORGANIZATION>Sainsbury</ORGANIZATION>'s
shopping bill or going out for a meal. This was in spite of the fact that
they might own a yacht, jet aircraft or private stables.
Many complained they were excluded from an upper class establishment 'either
because it was <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> based or because entry depended upon a university
education', said <PERSON>Prof Scott</PERSON>.
Women were less content than men. Only five of the 70 families had women
heading their business activities; in the others, almost all key decisions
were taken by men.
Yet many women had played an important role in founding family fortunes
either through their work or by providing the initial capital. One woman
told the study: 'It was his dream, my money.'
Businessmen, in spite of their natural desire to hand down their wealth,
displayed a surprising lack of concern about passing on their companies to
their children.
Many took the view that the next generation had the right to pursue its own
path and that their businesses might do better under the control of
non-family members, said Prof Scott.
As a result, many owners planned to sell their businesses when they retired
although landed families were determined to keep their estates intact.

   An Indian Lawyer and His Ruby as Big as the Ritz
   ----

<LP>
   Bangalore, India -- The Guinness Book of Records has its
loonies, its freaks of nature and its 5,500-pound hamburgers.
But it also has gemsreal gems, huge gems-and that list is the
most glittering in the book. There's the giant Star of Africa
diamond, Queen Elizabeth's crown jewel, sunk in a high-tech
vault in the Tower of London. And there's a 136-pound
flawless crystal ball on display at the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington, D.C.
   The two largest star rubies in the world, according to the
Guinness Book, are the Rajaratna and the Indumathi from
India. One of the largest double star sapphires is the
Neelanjali. For years -- possibly centuries -- these three
stones, and a smaller fourth stone, were disguised beneath a
covering of black soot. Then, in 1983, an aging lawyer named
G. Vidyaraj found the black lumps in his parents' house,
attempted to give them away and then, mildly curious, took an
old toothbrush to them. Overnight, he became the owner of one
of the most stupendous gem collections in the world.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The value of these gems is impossible to estimate," says
<PERSON>Mr. Vidyaraj</PERSON>, a tall, lumbering and, these days, ailing man.
"Literally, they're priceless. Some people say I am the
richest person in the world."
   It's one of those amazing fairy tales that seems only
possible in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> -- the homeland of Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON>'s
Kohinoor, another crown jewel -- but one with a bittersweet
ending. Seven years after his find, <PERSON>Mr. Vidyaraj</PERSON> has his
rubies, his sapphire and his three entries in the Guinness
Book. Otherwise, he's gotten nothing. He's reluctant to sell
the gems, wondering if anyone can afford such treasures. He
and his wife live on a stipend sent by his engineer son, who
lives in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> He's bitter that his own country
has shown no interest in the collection. And he constantly
worries about robbers and kidnappers. Threats come through
the mail and by phone; the local police are frequently
dispatched to guard his modest, first-floor rental apartment
in this southern Indian city.
   <PERSON>Mr. Vidyaraj</PERSON> is a distinguished man, with precise,
lawyerly speech, an impeccable double-breasted suit and
starchy, white hair. He is a direct descendant of the
Vijayanagara kings, who controlled much of south <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> from
the 14th to 16th centuries. History recalls the strongest
king, <PERSON>Krishna Deva Raya</PERSON> (1509-30), as an early advocate of
free trade. He imported velvets and damasks from <LOCATION>Aden</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, horses from <LOCATION>Arabia</LOCATION>, elephants from <ORGANIZATION>Ceylon</ORGANIZATION>, gold,
silver -- and precious gems. Presumably, this solves the
essential mystery of <PERSON>Mr. Vidyaraj</PERSON>'s gems: They were court
jewels, or the spoils of the Vijayanagara era, which someone
protectively blackened against invasion or plunder. How,
when? <PERSON>Mr. Vidyaraj</PERSON> doesn't have a clue. All he knows is that
his parents inherited the four black lumps, which they kept
in the family "puja", or offering, room. They considered them
sacred, not invaluable.
   "I remember my father worshipping them," says <PERSON>Mr.
Vidyaraj</PERSON>, "and singing songs in praise of <ORGANIZATION>Shiva</ORGANIZATION> {a major
Hindu god}." His parents died in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> and <DATE>1970s</DATE>. In <DATE>1982</DATE>
he cleaned out the family house and brought the sacred stones
to his cramped apartment here, storing them in a cupboard.
The next year he and his wife tried to donate them to a
temple, but the donation got caught in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s infamous red
tape. Driving home from the temple, he examined the black
lumps for the first time. He wondered aloud whether they
might contain gold. His wife, <LOCATION>Indumathi</LOCATION>, reacted with horror.
She said it would be sacrilege to melt them down and insisted
they be donated to another temple as soon as possible.
   But <PERSON>Mr. Vidyaraj</PERSON> had different plans. One day, he
dispatched his wife, daughter and the family chauffeur to the
movies. He brought the lumps to the kitchen and went at one
of them with a soapy toothbrush. "Until then I thought it was
metal," he says. "I held it against the light. I saw specks
of red." Underneath the soot was a star ruby weighing 2,805
carats. The second lump was a double star ruby weighing 1,125
carats. The third was a double star sapphire of 2,470 carats
and the fourth lump, though not Guinness Book material, was a
ruby of 650 carats.
   The lawyer-turned-gem-owner took a crash course in
gemology and hauled the stones to a succession of local
jewelers for cleaning and cutting. He was security conscious
from the start, using different cutters for different stones
and never revealing the full extent of his find. He went
public with the smallest ruby, the <PERSON>Vidyaraj</PERSON>, named for
himself, in <DATE>1984</DATE>. The Indumathi, which was named after his
wife, was revealed a few months later. In <DATE>1987</DATE> he displayed
the big ruby, the <LOCATION>Rajaratna</LOCATION>, which after cutting, weighed
2,475 carats, and then the sapphire. He had them certified
and made the Guinness Book, which he considers his highest
achievement, or, as he puts it, "this height of eminence. If
I was in another country I'd probably be honored."
   <PERSON>Mr. Vidyaraj</PERSON> has hidden the gems in bank vaults and won't
even disclose if they remain in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>. No one is allowed near
them, including journalists. The gems, which are uninsured,
are cut in cabochon shape, producing convex round stones
that, to a layman, lack the visual appeal of the glittering,
faceted gems in jewelry shops. "To an untrained eye, they are
rough stones not meaning anything," says <PERSON>Mr. Vidyaraj</PERSON>. "But
they can't be faceted: These are not ordinary articles of
commerce. For a person well-versed in gemology they are
geological wonders because of their size." Gem experts say
the value of the stones depends largely on their color and
their purity, which need to be assessed. <PERSON>Mr. Vidyaraj</PERSON>
believes they are worth a fortune easily exceeding <MONEY>$500
million</MONEY>. "The person who wants to buy them would have to be
the richest person in the world," he says. "I am just an
ordinary person, maybe below ordinary, out of fashion. And
yet, if my collection is valued . . ."
   Why hasn't <PERSON>Mr. Vidyaraj</PERSON> tried to sell the stones? Because
he's terrified of a "web of intrigue." His wife is a content,
pious woman, he says, totally uninterested in money. He and
his family have lived in the same one-bedroom apartment for
decades. His rent: <MONEY>$5.80</MONEY> per month. His son supports the
couple and pays <PERSON>Mr. Vidyaraj</PERSON>'s medical bills. (Last year, he
almost died of complications from diabetes.) He's spent his
savings getting the gems cut and recognized by the outside
world.
   The government of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> once considered issuing postage
stamps honoring Indians in the Guinness Book, but the plan
never came through. This disappointed <PERSON>Mr. Vidyaraj</PERSON>, who sees
his gems as a national treasure. He also considers himself
the top Indian in the Guinness Book. There are quite a few,
most of them holding records for such feats as the longest
after-dinner speech or consumption of the greatest quantity
of glass. "How much publicity does a guy get who grows the
longest fingernails?" <PERSON>Mr. Vidyaraj</PERSON> asks sarcastically
(apparently referring to <PERSON>Shridhar Chillal</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Pune</LOCATION>, who
stopped cutting his nails in <DATE>1952</DATE>. The Guinness Book reports
that <PERSON>Mr. Chillal</PERSON> is having trouble sleeping with his
14.4-foot nails and is willing to clip and sell them to any
interested party).
   But <PERSON>Mr. Vidyaraj</PERSON> still talks big about his gems, peppering
his conversation with quotes from <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Aldous
Huxley</LOCATION>. "My intention is to donate this treasure to humanity.
In its humble way, it could help with the scourge of cancer,
AIDS or education. So large is my head, so big is my
thinking]"
   His is a strange and somewhat sad tale, but perhaps not as
unique as it sounds. The Guinness Book relates that the
largest natural intense fancy blue diamond was found in <DATE>1904</DATE>.
It was exhibited in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> in <DATE>1925</DATE> and then sold. The buyer
was an Indian maharajah. According to <ORGANIZATION>Guinness</ORGANIZATION>: "Its current
owners are unknown."

   Charity began at home for <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> stores
founder <PERSON>Sam Walton</PERSON>, who ended a four-year reign as Forbes
magazine's richest American by sharing his <MONEY>$9 billion</MONEY> fortune with
his four children.
   <ORGANIZATION>Metromedia Co</ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON>John Werner Kluge</PERSON>, with an estimated net
worth of <MONEY>$5.2 billion</MONEY>, climbed into first place on <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON>' annual
list of the nation's 400 wealthiest people.
   The prototypical member of <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION>' ultra-rich was a 63-year-old
male with 3.1 children working on his 1.4th marriage with a net
worth of <MONEY>$672 million</MONEY> last year, more than the gross national
product of <LOCATION>Lesotho</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON> said.
   The compilation contains 346 men and 54 women. Of those, 159
inherited their wealth. Eight states lack a resident on the list.
   Among alma mater represented, <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> educated 22 of the richest,
<ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> 17 and the <ORGANIZATION>University of Pennsylvania</ORGANIZATION> 12; the 45 with
master's degrees in business had an average net worth of <MONEY>$895
million</MONEY>, while the 10 high-school dropouts had an average of <MONEY>$854
million</MONEY>.
   Overall, <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON>' richest are worth an estimated total of about
<MONEY>$269 billion</MONEY>, up nearly <MONEY>$50 billion</MONEY> from <DATE>last year</DATE>, a <PERCENT>22 percent</PERCENT>
increase that substantially outpaced last year's <PERCENT>4.4 percent</PERCENT>
inflation rate.
   That total wealth would come just short of bailing out te
nation's failed savings and loans over the <DATE>next 30 years</DATE>, the cost
of which was estimated by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> at <MONEY>$285 billion</MONEY>.
   The list, released <DATE>Monday</DATE>, appears in the <DATE>Oct. 23</DATE> issue of
<LOCATION>Forbes</LOCATION> and is based on estimated holdings as of <DATE>Sept. 8</DATE>.
   At the pinnacle is <PERSON>Kluge</PERSON>, 75, of <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, whose
holdings rose an estimated <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY> from the previous year thanks
to a tripling in the value of his investment in cellular
telephones, <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON> said.
   Kluge moved up from the No. 2 spot. The magazine noted that
``klug'' in German means smart.
   <PERSON>Walton</PERSON>, 71, of <LOCATION>Bentonville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ark.</LOCATION>, who milked cows during the
Depression to support his family, split his <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> and other
assets equally with his four children. While the family's total
holdings increased from <MONEY>$6.7 bilion</MONEY>, the individual family members
tied for 20th on the list, each at <MONEY>$1.8 billion</MONEY>.
   Moving up to second from 12th place is investor <PERSON>Warren Buffett</PERSON>,
59, of <LOCATION>Omaha</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Neb.</LOCATION>, the head of <PERSON>Berkshire Hathaway</PERSON>, whose stock
market-based fortune nearly doubled, to <MONEY>$4.2 billion</MONEY>. Behind him is
<PERSON>Sumner M. Redstone</PERSON>, head of moviehouse operator <ORGANIZATION>National Amusements
Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and TV-cable giant <ORGANIZATION>Viacom</ORGANIZATION>, with <MONEY>$2.88 billion</MONEY>.
   The number of billionaires increased to 66 from 51. The minimum
net worth to make the list rose to <MONEY>$275 million</MONEY> from <MONEY>$225 million</MONEY>.
   America has more billionaires than any other nation _ <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> is
second with 41 _ but the richest of the world's rich are foreigners.
   Kluge's fortune makes him the ninth-wealthiest private
individual in the world, according to <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION>. He is topped by six
Japanese, a South Korean and Canadian publisher <PERSON>Kenneth Roy
Thompson</PERSON>. <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Yoshiaki Tsutsumi</PERSON>, who made his money in land,

THE MISOGYNY OF IMPRESSIONISM; 
</P>
<P>
UTRILLO'S MOTHER BY SARAH BAYLIS (RUTGERS PRESS: $19.95; 246 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

International Image Magazine. She lives and works in Paris.

<TEXT>
<P>
"I've always been a liar -- it runs in my family," begins <PERSON>Sarah Baylis</PERSON>' 
brilliant and biting novel, "Utrillo's Mother." Capturing our attention and 
imagination while failing speculation as to the veracity of her story, <PERSON>Baylis</PERSON> 
recounts in a series of flashbacks a fictionalized biography of 
Marie-Clementine (<PERSON>Suzanne</PERSON>) <PERSON>Valadon</PERSON> (1865/7-1938). 
</P>
<P>
The mother of <PERSON>Utrillo</PERSON>, she was a talented post-Impressionist artist in a period 
when the art world was experiencing tremendous growth and upheaval, though it 
remained almost exclusively a male domain. 
</P>
<P>
Baylis writes about art and politics, women and sex, oppression, freedom, 
self-expression and social stigma from an ardently feminist perspective. Her 
vision is frank and refreshing, sparing neither the sacred cows of 
Impressionism nor our preconceptions of their world as portrayed in their 
paintings. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Baylis</PERSON>' protagonist is brash. She acts without regret or apology. She sells 
herself time and again, yet survives on her own terms. We may blush at her 
audacious conduct but admire her courage and conviction. Her desire to paint, 
to draw, to be an artist overwhelms all else. She sleeps with artists to learn 
their technique, models for others to steal tubes of paint or drawing pads. 
</P>
<P>
The novel is multidimensional. Political and social events helped to inspire 
the new art and bring on the rejection of the standards of the Academie des 
Beaux Arts. Turn-of-the-century artists were caught up in the spirit of 
revolution which led them to strike out in new directions and experiment with 
new ideas: Impressionism, Pointillism, Symbolism. Much of the descriptive 
narrative involves the events of the revolution of <DATE>1860</DATE>, the <LOCATION>Paris Commune</LOCATION>, the 
Prussian War, the turn-of-the-century Parisian cafe society. Baylis gives us 
characters which bring to life the period: the beautiful baker's daughter who 
paints slogans, the lesbian waitress who introduces <PERSON>Valadon</PERSON> to the seedy 
underground. <PERSON>Baylis</PERSON>' descriptions are luscious and earthy, giving us not only 
sights and sounds but the odors and the emotional fervor of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
This historical context is equally important in establishing the role of women, 
and thus the basis for <PERSON>Valadon</PERSON>'s outrage at the injustice she suffers. Baylis 
gives a brutal description of the lives of the working-class women of the time 
-- their backbreaking menial work, their constant fear of starvation and 
poverty, the very hopelessness of their plight. 
</P>
<P>
It is with this reference point that <PERSON>Baylis</PERSON> critiques so strongly <ORGANIZATION>Watteau</ORGANIZATION>, 
<ORGANIZATION>Fragonard</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Renoir</ORGANIZATION> and other artists in their rose-tinted portrayals of 
shepherdesses and washerwomen: "Washerwomen were the rage. . . . Contemptible 
in real life, they were now almost respectable in fine art . . . but where 
slavery exists in a civilized society it must be quickly romanticized, or else 
there will be complaints, petitions, fuss and bother . . . and we'll all be 
waiting until domesday for our collars and cuffs. The same painted tradition 
that had transformed the shepherdess from a dung-smeared illiterate into a 
beribboned picnicker changed the lowly washerwoman from a tippler to a giggling 
cutie." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, on another level, the novel is atemporal. Valadon's feelings are too real, 
too natural: We identify too easily with her fantasies and with her struggle. 
Questions of sexual politics, of woman's role in society -- these are questions 
that are valid today in our society. 
</P>
<P>
The story begins with <PERSON>Valadon</PERSON> as an old woman, looking back on her childhood on 
a farm where she lived with her mother, <PERSON>Madeleine</PERSON>. Her mother is called 
Madeleine throughout the book, possibly indicating the tense and angry nature 
of the mother/daughter relationship: "We were tied together by poverty and 
kinship, hating both and loathing each other, eaten up by love and guilt." 
</P>
<P>
The farm is described in detail, a dark and dirty place seen through the eyes 
of an unhappy child. In one episode, there is an encounter with a Gypsy, and we 
see immediately the scene through the eyes of the artist: "I wish I could have 
painted her like that -- I would have made her green brown, then outlined her 
hands with a strong black line and all the colours of her clothes would be rich 
and sombre against the turbulent grass." 
</P>
<P>
Having revolted against her insulting and obnoxious employer, <PERSON>Madeleine</PERSON> is 
forced to leave, and with child in tow, heads for the city, hoping to improve 
her lot. Their lot does not improve. Madeleine finds another menial job and 
sends <PERSON>Valadon</PERSON> off to a convent school: "The place reeked of suppressed sex and 
the girls were infected by it. We were the most obscene creatures; pornography 
was scrawled on the toilet walls and swear words, picked up from our brothers 
and fathers were the cornerstone of our language -- alongside that 
cannibalistic butcherspeak that religious people use." 
</P>
<P>
After the convent, <PERSON>Valadon</PERSON> holds a series of jobs -- in a hat factory, then in 
a restaurant where she becomes a waitress and a pickpocket: "I loved thieving, 
it was my chief satisfaction. They had so much it wouldn't be missed. They were 
rich old cows in fancy hats and fox furs, who despised me. They deserved to be 
inconvenienced." 
</P>
<P>
After the restaurant, a vegetable stand, then, taking a 50-year-old clown as 
her lover, a job with the circus. It is at the circus that she meets Theo, her 
first artist, and she becomes involved with him and his world, learning from 
his work and eventually becoming a model. She models for <ORGANIZATION>Renoir</ORGANIZATION> and Chavannes, 
all the while drawing and painting furiously on her own. The transition from 
model to artist of some renown is gradual. She meets <LOCATION>Degas</LOCATION>, whom she considers 
brilliant: "He was called a misogynist, too. If a painter portrays a woman as 
she is, that painter will be called a misogynist, a hater of women. 
</P>
<P>
For to portray women with truthfulness is to suggest that you accept them as 
they are, and that is the most dangerous thing you can do in the world. Just 
think of it! If women are ever accepted as they are -- exhausted, possessed, 
angry and bartered . . . then the world will have to change in every single 
particle." Valadon ignores the critics and continues her art but is finally 
betrayed by her femininity -- she gets pregnant and the son she bears marks 
forever her destiny: "Never encourage your son to pick up a brush and dabble 
with painting, within a few months they'll say he has outstripped you . . . 
they'll do anything to hold a woman back, even use her poor drunken son to 
betray her. . . . <LOCATION>Christ</LOCATION>, it's hurtful this endless punishment of being mother 
to a painter." There are more liaisons -- a banker, a painter, and eventually 
some fame and fortune. 
</P>
<P>
Although today she is recognized as a gifted artist, a modern reference book 
refers to <PERSON>Valadon</PERSON>'s work as "violent." If this be the case, certainly <PERSON>Baylis</PERSON> 
has created a biography that would explain the violent nature of her work. More 
important, <PERSON>Baylis</PERSON>' rich prose brings to life a vibrant and impassioned 
character -- a character whose ideas are as truthful and vital in <DATE>1989</DATE> as they 
were 100 years ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
Through the window of <PERSON>C. David Heymann</PERSON>'s 14th-floor apartment on <LOCATION>Central Park 
West</LOCATION>, the tender green leaves of <DATE>spring</DATE> sag under the weight of a heavy rain. 
On the other side of the park's verdant expanse, on fashionable Fifth Avenue, 
lives a woman named <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Whether <PERSON>Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis</PERSON> likes it or not, <PERSON>C. David Heymann</PERSON> is the man 
whose name is being linked these days with that of the Most Famous Woman in the 
World. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Heymann</PERSON> is the author of one of the <DATE>spring</DATE>'s hottest books, "A Woman Named 
Jackie" (<PERSON>Lyle Stuart</PERSON>, <MONEY>$21.95</MONEY>), a sizzling 631-page unauthorized biography of 
the former <ORGANIZATION>First Lady</ORGANIZATION>, who will turn 60 in <DATE>July</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Magazines, newspapers and television have been tripping over one another in a 
rush to get the book's most titillating tidbits into print. It has been a 
veritable <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> bonanza, a tabloid-lover's dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie and J.F.K. shot up with amphetamines by a "Dr. Feelgood." . . . A 
lovesick <PERSON>Marilyn</PERSON> phones <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>. . . . Womanizing J.F.K. beds 
just about anything that moves. . . . <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON>'s coldness makes <PERSON>Onassis</PERSON> want a 
divorce. . . . <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> goes on shop-till-you-drop binges. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And true to her very private form, <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON>, through her spokeswoman <PERSON>Nancy 
Tuckerman</PERSON>, has had a discreet "no comment" on this latest tell-all tome. 
</P>
<P>
Why our endless fascination with a woman whom <PERSON>Heymann</PERSON>, after four years of 
research and interviews with 825 sources, still calls "a mystery, a 
hieroglyphic, a question mark"? 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Jackie</PERSON>, probably because she's never spoken in her own behalf, has remained a 
subject of tremendous interest to Americans and to people all over the world," 
says <PERSON>Heymann</PERSON>, 44, who hit the best-seller lists a few years ago with "Poor 
Little Rich Girl," a biography of <ORGANIZATION>Woolworth</ORGANIZATION> heiress <PERSON>Barbara Hutton</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
If <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> has maintained a regal silence, plenty of people -- from the late 
<PERSON>Christina Onassis</PERSON> to the public relations director of <ORGANIZATION>Maxim</ORGANIZATION>'s -- talked to 
<PERSON>Heymann</PERSON> and his crew of researchers. And while <PERSON>Heymann</PERSON> refused to quote anyone 
anonymously, three of his main sources -- <PERSON>Christina Onassis</PERSON>, <PERSON>Peter Lawford</PERSON> and 
Truman Capote -- are dead. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the wonders of this century is that we have a tape recorder, and 
they're on tape," <PERSON>Heymann</PERSON> says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Government Files Helped 
</P>
<P>
And thanks to the Freedom of Information Act, <PERSON>Heymann</PERSON> made extensive use of 
<ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Secret Service</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> social files. The <ORGANIZATION>Secret Service</ORGANIZATION> 
files chart President <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON>'s insatiable appetite for women, and <PERSON>Heymann</PERSON>'s 
account of the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> years reads like "Fanny Hill." 
</P>
<P>
"I think <PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON>, in retrospect, is a disgrace," <PERSON>Heymann</PERSON> says. 
</P>
<P>
If <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON> and the image of Camelot emerge tattered and tarnished, <PERSON>Aristotle 
Onassis</PERSON> comes out smelling like a comparative rose. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he made some genuine efforts to have a fulfilling marriage. He grew 
close at least to <PERSON>John Jr.</PERSON>," <PERSON>Heymann</PERSON> says. 
</P>
<P>
Heymann claims to have only respect for the way <PERSON>Jackie Onassis</PERSON> has dealt with 
adversity and tragedy in her life and for her courage in returning to work late 
in life as a book editor. 
</P>
<P>
"She's regal; she's elegant as ever; she is an everlasting mystery," he says. 
"I think she's elevated the human spirit in this country. If there were more 
<PERSON>Jackie Kennedys</PERSON> around, this would be a better place in which to live. I find 
her to be a very noble person." 
</P>
<P>
Readers are likely to come away from "A Woman Named Jackie" with mixed emotions 
-- moved by her devastation at the loss of <PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON>, put off by her 
apparent coldness and determination to live in the lap of luxury. 
</P>
<P>
"She's human. She does have frailties, and money is her Achilles' heel," 
<PERSON>Heymann</PERSON> says. "But compare her to the Duchess of <LOCATION>Windsor</LOCATION>, for example, who put 
herself before <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>. The poor guy (<ORGANIZATION>Edward VIII</ORGANIZATION>) had to step off the throne. 
Here's a woman who, despite her husband's carrying on, put the country before 
herself and supported <PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON>, who lent herself to making the <ORGANIZATION>White 
House</ORGANIZATION> a splendid place." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Woman of Many Faces 
</P>
<P>
Although <PERSON>Heymann</PERSON> insists that his portrait of <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> is positive, his book 
unflinchingly quotes those who see her variously as avaricious, as icy, as less 
intelligent than she has been purported to be. 
</P>
<P>
Readers learn that <PERSON>Christina Onassis</PERSON> loathed the glamorous woman who married 
her wealthy father. They read that <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> glared icily at <LOCATION>JFK</LOCATION> when he and <PERSON>Angie 
Dickinson</PERSON> slipped away for an apparent tryst on <ORGANIZATION>Inauguration Night</ORGANIZATION>. They are 
told that <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> was drinking heavily when she recounted the horrors of her 
husband's assassination to author <PERSON>William Manchester</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Are there limits to what the public has a right -- or even a desire -- to know? 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are interested in people," <PERSON>Heymann</PERSON> says. "We're all animals on 
this <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. We're all at the same watering hole and we look at each other. 
That's basically what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Heymann</PERSON> began his writing career as a poet and literary biographer. "Ezra 
Pound" and "American Aristocracy: The Lives and Times of <PERSON>James Russell</PERSON>, <PERSON>Amy</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Robert Lowell</PERSON>" were nominated for Pulitzer Prizes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Why the Tabloid Books? 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I couldn't continue to write literary biography and support a 
family. I don't mean to suggest I write just for money, but a person does have 
to make a living," <PERSON>Heymann</PERSON> says in explaining why he has moved on to books like 
"A Woman Named Jackie" and "Poor Little Rich Girl." 
</P>
<P>
The <PERSON>Barbara Hutton</PERSON> biography, originally published by <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1983</DATE>, was 
recalled, according to <PERSON>Heymann</PERSON>, because of an error about the date of birth of 
a <ORGANIZATION>Hutton</ORGANIZATION> physician, which left open the possibility of a lawsuit. The physician 
was charged with overmedicating the heiress. <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> would not republish 
the book; <PERSON>Lyle Stuart</PERSON> then picked up the rights, and the book went on to become 
a best seller and a TV miniseries. <PERSON>Heymann</PERSON> says that the incident does not 
impugn his integrity or credibility. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is <PERSON>Heymann</PERSON> daunted by his own admission at the end of 631 pages that the 
real <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> remains elusive. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what the book is about in a sense; it's a search for the real <PERSON>Jackie 
Kennedy</PERSON>. This is a woman who is simply unknowable, who probably doesn't even 
know herself," <PERSON>Heymann</PERSON> says. 
</P>
<P>
But with bookstore orders upping the in-print total of "A Woman Named Jackie" 
to 450,000 copies just a week after publication, it is clear that inquiring 
minds will take what they can get.

visited <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> as a member of an international fact-finding team 
during the fatherland liberation war (<DATE>June 1950</DATE>- <DATE>July 1953</DATE>) and 
exposed to the world people the bestial atrocities committed by 
the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> imperialist aggressors against the Korean people. 
  He expressed the hope that this book would help the 
revolutionary people of the world to have a clearer 
understanding of the validity and invincible vitality of the 
socialist cause for its rich, truthful and revolutionary 
contents and for its diversified, concise and vivid method of 
expression. 
  <PERSON>Candelaria Rodriguez</PERSON>, the author of the book, spoke next. 
  Noting why she wrote the book, she said: 
  "I have come to write this book in order to inform the world 
people, even a little, of the true looks of <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> which rose 
like a phoenix from heaps of rubbles and has completely changed 
its appearance startling the world people under the wise 
guidance of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  In his speech, Han Pong-chan, deputy director general of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Foreign Press Group</ORGANIZATION>, noted that the book in Spanish was 
translated and published in French, Chinese, English and Russian 
and disseminated among foreigners. This book, he added, will 
greatly encourage not only the Korean people in their tireless 
efforts to defend and further glorify the Korean-style socialism 
centred on the masses but also the revolutionary people of the 
world in their righteous struggle.

<HL> Trump Sniffs at Plaza Bid, Leaving a Sultan Sulking </HL>

<DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON> bought the Plaza Hotel for roughly <MONEY>$400 million</MONEY> this year, the judgment of many real estate observers was that he paid too much. 

   Industry sources, however, say <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> already has received -- and rejected -- an offer for the Plaza that would have net him a <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> profit. 

   The sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, reputedly the world's richest person, recently offered to buy it for a little more than <MONEY>$500 million</MONEY>. 
When <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> declined, the sultan upped his bid to roughly <MONEY>$600 million</MONEY>, the sources say. 
But <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> said no deal. 

   The sultan apparently didn't get wind that the Plaza had been on the market before <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON>, who bought it from the <PERSON>Robert M. Bass Group</PERSON>, had more or less locked it up. 
"It was the one hotel he wanted to own more than any in the world," a source said of the sultan. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> declined to sell because he likes owning the famed, landmark hotel and wants to make good on his vow to make it the world's best, sources say. 
<PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> declined to comment. 

   The ruler of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, a tiny Asian nation on the oil-rich island of <LOCATION>Borneo</LOCATION>, has a fortune estimated at <MONEY>$25 billion</MONEY>, and lives in a 1,788-room palace. 

   Last year, the sultan bought the <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION> Hotel from oil and entertainment tycoon <PERSON>Marvin Davis</PERSON>, reportedly for more than <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY> -- just months after <PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON> purchased it from one-time stock speculator <PERSON>Ivan Boesky</PERSON> for roughly <MONEY>$135 million</MONEY>.

A young woman threw a T-shirt at <ORGANIZATION>Queen Elizabeth II</ORGANIZATION> today and radicals 
campaigning for Maori rights heckled the British monarch during anniversary 
celebrations for the founding of modern <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>.

of radicals shouted "You already have everything! What more do you want, 
<PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON>?" and "150 years of oppression!"
