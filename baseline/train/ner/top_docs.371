   It's Never Fun, but It's Not Often
   A Dog Bite Is Really a Royal Pain

   LONDON -- Scandalous questions are dogging Britain's Royal
Family: Why are the royal pooches biting the hand that feeds
them? Is there bad blood among the blue-blooded canines?
   Dog behaviorists all over this dog-crazy nation were
seeking answers yesterday after Buckingham Palace tersely
confirmed that Queen Elizabeth II had been bitten on the left
hand by one of her beloved pet corgis. Apparently, the queen,
trying to reassert royal authority, waded into a snarling
pack of 10 corgis who had dropped their palace manners and
were busy thrashing one another.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It was the second royal free-for-all involving palace
corgis in the past two years. In <DATE>1989</DATE>, the queen's corgi
Chipper was killed by a corgi pack led by <ORGANIZATION>Ranger</ORGANIZATION>, a corgi
owned by Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON>'s mother, known affectionately here
as the Queen Mum. In this case, as well, two of the pooches
apparently belonged to the Queen Mum.
   In the latest incident, which occurred at <ORGANIZATION>Windsor Castle</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Her Majesty</ORGANIZATION> suffered a nip on a finger and thumb; the wounds
required three stitches. A royal chauffeur was also bitten
while trying to help the queen separate the dogs.
   "The queen is very brave to have done this," says canine
behaviorist <PERSON>Anthony Burley</PERSON>, who shudders to think that the
attack could have been much worse. "To put your hand in
between fighting corgis is to put your hand into a food
mixer." Corgis are a handful -- low, long and strong, with
grown males averaging 20 to 24 pounds.
   Buckingham Palace might have been tempted to let sleeping
dogs lie and refuse to confirm the attack, except that the
queen's injuries were observed publicly for the first time
yesterday when she conducted a 75-minute investiture ceremony
at the palace. Palace observers who were present noted that
she sported plastic bandages on her left thumb and
forefinger.
   While lauding the queen's bravery, dog psychologists were
also gently suggesting to Her Majesty that she consider other
means of restoring order among her dogs. "Grab a tea tray and
bang it loudly over their heads, then drop it between the
dogs," <PERSON>Mr. Burley</PERSON> says. "You need something physical between
them, but it shouldn't be your hand."
   Unanswered is whether the dog that drew royal blood is in
the royal doghouse. But <PERSON>Roger Mugford</PERSON>, the queen's animal
behaviorist, says: "I suspect the dog will be forgiven."

<TEXT>
   A dog belonging to <PERSON>Queen Elizabeth II</PERSON> died after
being bitten in a fight with other royal dogs at <ORGANIZATION>Windsor Castle</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Chipper, a 12-year-old cross between a dachshund and a corgi,
was involved in a fight started by <ORGANIZATION>Ranger</ORGANIZATION>, a corgi belonging to
<PERSON>Queen Mother Elizabeth</PERSON>, the palace said <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   The crossbreed, known as a dorgi, was stitched up after the
fight by a veterinarian but died, the palace said.
   The queen was given a corgi by her parents in the <DATE>1930s</DATE> when she
was a little princess. They became the royal family's most popular
house dogs because of their small size but palace staff and
visitors say the dogs tend to snap at ankles.
   Princess <PERSON>Margaret</PERSON>, the queen's sister, preferred dachshunds.

<TEXT>
   Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth II</PERSON>'s corgi dogs are being treated
by an animal psychologist because of their bad record of nipping
members of the royal household, The Mail on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> reported.
   The paper said guardsmen, policemen, footmen and even the royal
clockwinder have fallen prey to the corgis' nips.
   <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> refused comment. ``I don't think we'd like to
comment on that kind of story,'' said a palace spokesman who by
custom was not identified.
   The dogs are being seen by animal behavior specialist <PERSON>Dr. Roger
Mugford</PERSON>, who firmly believes in counseling owners as well, The Mail
on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> said.
   Mugford, whose office was closed <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, was quoted by the paper
as saying of corgis: ``They are, of course, collie-type dogs,
originally bred for cattle herding. As such, they will chase
anything, particularly ankles.''
   The present generation of royal corgis, according to the paper,
are named: Spark, <LOCATION>Mist</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Sable</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Diamond</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Kelpie</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Piper</ORGANIZATION>,
Chipper and <PERSON>Harris</PERSON>. The article did not say how many of the dogs are

FT  15 FEB 92 / A dog's life at Buck House: As they say in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY foreign correspondent in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> has seen the <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> film that celebrated
the 40th anniversary of the Queen's accession to the throne, <ORGANIZATION>Elizabeth R</ORGANIZATION>, or
Isabel R as she is known in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>.
Isabel, <LOCATION>Felipe</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Carlos</PERSON> and Ana are familiar figures there: Spitting Image,
the coarse British satirical television programme, has a wide audience. Such
are the realities of the <LOCATION>New Europe</LOCATION>. So <PERSON>Enric Gonzalez</PERSON> in <LOCATION>El Pais</LOCATION> was
writing for a well-informed readership in his useful summary of the Queen's
decades.
'<PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON> has seen the disappearance of the Empire, the hard recovery of
the <DATE>1950s</DATE>, the cultural revolution of the '60s, the trade union torments of
the '70s and the petty bourgeois Thatcherite insurrection of the '80s
without altering her routine.' The heart of this routine is tea. The Queen
always takes tea with her corgis, 'for whom she personally mixes meat and
biscuits which the little animals eat on the red carpets of her private
homes.'
Corgis were fully researched for <ORGANIZATION>Bernhard Heimrich</ORGANIZATION>'s account in the
<LOCATION>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</LOCATION>. 'Corgis are short-legged, bustling little
dogs from <LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION>, which in the handbook are described as ideal for the
farmyard, vigilant guardians and good comrades. The queen has six corgis,
which she feeds with meat and biscuits every day at half past four.'
Heimrich finds the British almost as interesting as the corgis. He says that
a third of us dream about the Queen, and most of the dreams include drinking
tea with the monarch - sans corgis. So we enter the British subconscious,
and a dark place it proves to be:
'The second surprise (after the dreams) is that it is mainly night in the
<PERSON>Reich</PERSON> of Elizabeth II. This has been recognised for some time but has not
been fully accepted. On the Empire of her predecessor the sun never set. The
four decades of Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth II</PERSON> encompass the British generation which
has to abandon this dream, and the Queen as a dream figure behind the walls
of her palace in the middle of British reality, is there to help.'
Le <PERSON>Monde</PERSON>'s correspondent, <PERSON>Laurent Zecchini</PERSON>, emerges as a hitherto
unimaginable entity - a French <PERSON>Barbara Pym</PERSON>. He too reports the dream of
taking tea with the Queen. 'In the collective unconscious of her people, the
Queen keeps her place at the centre of a pile of useless little things,
dusty but essential, which make <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION> in the eyes of so many people
the vestal priestess of the cult of memories . . .'
The elegiac theme then really takes hold: 'Forty years, and always that
certain smile - a little fixed, this great professionalism, this intangible
etiquette, these prime ministers who succeed one another for the invariable
tea and conversations of no importance.'
The Italians care little for psychological speculation, and less for tea, or
even corgis. They are interested in not paying income tax. So in Il Sole-24
Ore, <PERSON>Alessandro Merli</PERSON>, with his usual good taste, celebrated 40 glorious
years of getting away with it. He reverently asked: 'Is the Queen of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>
the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>'s biggest tax evader?'
Merli noted that earlier monarchs had indeed paid income tax. He then ran
through the figures on the Queen's wealth and income and concluded she could
well afford to pay. But he has fears about the succession: her non-payment
of tax 'does not mean that <PERSON>Prince Charles</PERSON>, who likes to appear in the
forefront of 'inner city' causes, will not start doing it again.'
That will not satisfy the royalist <PERSON>Zecchini</PERSON> in Le Monde: 'The Queen will
have to find a recipe for a sort of neo-monarchy for the next century, an
alchemy which will bring together modernity and tradition. In the <DATE>next
decade</DATE> the Queen will celebrate her golden jubilee and her 75 years. Until
then, without any doubt, 'God Save the Queen.''

<LEADPARA>  THE sight of Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip and the rest of the British
royal family waving from the front upstairs balcony at Buckingham Palace is
familiar. What's totally unfamiliar are the rooms behind that balcony -- the
palace interior.;   There is the frieze-filled Centre Room, where the royal
family lines up before walking out on the balcony. There is the Music Room,
with its domed ceiling and hardwood floors, where Princess Diana practiced her
tap dancing. And there is guest bedroom number No. 236, with its canopied bed,
pink silk walls and a cozy-looking but never used fireplace.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  BEAUTIFULLY ILLUSTRATED BOOKS MAKE LITERALLY
DELIGHTFUL GIFTS FOR FRIENDS OR EVEN YOURSELF
IT'S A ROYAL LIFE: BOOK LOOKS INSIDE BUCKINGHAM
PALACE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cover Story; See also related article on page 1D of this section.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     These rooms and the lifestyles of those who live in and pass through them
are the focus of "Inside Buckingham Palace, The Private World of the Royal
Family" by <PERSON>Andrew Morton</PERSON> (Summit Books, <MONEY>$20</MONEY>). This coffee-table style book,
with its beautiful photographs, is hard to put down, even if you don't follow
all the gossip about the royal family.;   "People see <LOCATION>Buckingham Palace</LOCATION> as a
personification of mystery and majesty," says <PERSON>Morton</PERSON>, who has spent more than
a decade chronicling the comings and goings of <LOCATION>Charles</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Diana</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Fergie</ORGANIZATION> and
all.;   "The palace is the center for national rejoicing and sorrow," he says.
"It was the place people ran to on the day the second World War ended. It's a
national rallying point and the royal family has come to symbolize universal
values of duty, obligation and family life.";   Life inside the palace,
according to <PERSON>Morton</PERSON>, is as different and extreme as any commoner might expect.
It takes three days to set the table for a major banquet, using place settings
valued at <MONEY>$5,400</MONEY> each, and another three days to wash up. A system of traffic
lights keeps the footmen, pages and butlers who serve and clear from
colliding. And there are two men who do nothing but tend to the winding and
servicing of the 300 clocks in the house.;   There are rooms set aside for
everything from television and radio broadcasts to a bedroom for the queen's
pet corgi dogs. One of the most fascinating is the Gift Room, so-called
because this is where the queen goes to choose gifts she wants to give
someone.;   "It's her own personal shop inside the palace," <PERSON>Morton</PERSON> says.
"Obviously she hasn't time to go shopping. There is lots of porcelain and the
gifts range from the simplest things like a waste basket to little silver
holders you put glasses of tea in.";   <PERSON>Morton</PERSON> divides the interior of the
palace into three areas. "The staff areas are like government offices or the
back rooms of a large hotel, without any glitter or glitz. There are the state
apartments which have polish -- red carpet, mirrors, Regency furniture and
gilt. And the private quarters, which are more comfortable and cozy." The
latter, he says, "contain the kinds of things they like -- pink carnations in
the queen's room and pictures she's chosen herself. Fergie's room has teddy
bears and a helicopter helmet and <ORGANIZATION>Fisher-Price</ORGANIZATION> toys all over the place.";   In
describing the private areas, <PERSON>Morton</PERSON> makes no attempt to hide his disdain for
the fact that <ORGANIZATION>Fergie</ORGANIZATION> has almost no closet space. "It's ridiculous -- you have
the premier duchess in the land with her clothes on hangers outside in the
red-carpeted corridor, but she likes <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> because it's
comfortable, near her friends, away from prying eyes, and she can enjoy
herself away from the public.";   Authoritative as he is on <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION>,
<PERSON>Morton</PERSON>'s visits have been confined to a narrow area that does not include even
the <ORGANIZATION>Centre Room</ORGANIZATION>, let alone the private quarters he describes in such vivid
detail.;   "After every book I write, the courtiers have a little inquiry on
how on earth I got such accurate information," he boasts. "It's because of
contacts. I've cultivated people in key positions like any specialist would.";
  Would <PERSON>Morton</PERSON> pay for information?;   He pauses slightly and says, "I'd
haggle.";   A testimony to his sleuthing is the detailed floor plan of the
principal and bedroom floors of the palace. "It's not well-known at all, but I
wanted to print the layout of the private quarters so people could get an idea
of it," he says.;   <PERSON>Morton</PERSON> has yet to hear what the queen or <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION> Yard
thinks about it, but he is pleased to reveal that one of his previous books,
about the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Yacht Britannia</ORGANIZATION>, was such a hit that "the queen gave lots of
copies away as Christmas presents.";   While they live in lavish surroundings,
the royal family is anything but lavish in their personal spending habits.
"There is no conspicuous consumption in the way of <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON> or that
<PERSON>Helmsley</PERSON> woman (<LOCATION>Leona</LOCATION>)," <PERSON>Morton</PERSON> says. "It's not the kind of family where you
could accuse them of living extravagantly. Everything is of the finest
quality, but they keep whatever they have for a long time, longer than you and
I.";   Fan that he admits he is, <PERSON>Morton</PERSON> still believes the economy kick is
taken too far at times. "It's ridiculous," he says. "You have <PERSON>Diana</PERSON> and <PERSON>Fergie</PERSON>
and the children using a local hotel's swimming pool because the queen hasn't
spent the money on a pool at <LOCATION>Balmoral</LOCATION>. It's the same at <LOCATION>Sandringham</LOCATION>. You have
the richest woman in the world not having a swimming pool!";   The pampered
life led by the queen and her family, with someone always there to run the
bath water, lay out their clothes and help them dress, has made them, in
<PERSON>Morton</PERSON>'s words, "a bit helpless. They're institutionalized. I don't mean that
in a nasty or negative way. Quite frankly, I'd feel a bit daunted if my day's
schedule said at 10:30 you'll hold an investiture, at noon you'll meet an
ambassador, at 2 you meet the prime minister, at 3 you do a walkabout and that
evening you host a dinner. If you've never done it before in your life, it's
the same way if you've never run a bath or pressed your clothes. They're bred
to a certain kind of function.";   <PERSON>Morton</PERSON> started covering the royal family
while working as a Fleet Street reporter.;   Three years ago <PERSON>Morton</PERSON> gave up
his newspaper job to start <ORGANIZATION>Palace Press</ORGANIZATION>, which specializes in covering the
royal family. He readily agrees most people view the topic he has chosen as
"very trivial, but once you get into it, it's a very interesting subject
because it touches on many areas of society from an anthropological,
sociological and historical viewpoint.";   While <PERSON>Morton</PERSON>'s latest book is on
the palace itself and the lifestyle within the walls, you can't resist asking
his opinion of the constant rumors about Prince <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> and <PERSON>Princess Diana</PERSON>'s
marriage.;   "There's always going to be rumors because of the 13-year age
gap," he says. "They have separate interests, a separate circle of friends and
separate timetables. I saw them in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, but they didn't seem to be happy.
Only people within a marriage can say how it is from day to day and month to
month."  </TEXT>

FT  02 APR 94 / Arts: Royals on the dole - Alastair Macaulay reviews The
Queen and I, on stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Name? '<PERSON>Elizabeth Windsor</PERSON>.' (A Social Services officer is interviewing the
next woman in line for an emergency supplementary payment.) 'Address?'
'<ORGANIZATION>Number Nine Hellebore Close</ORGANIZATION>' 'Former address?' '<ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION>, The
Mall.' 'What were you doing there?' 'I was being the Queen.' 'You were in an
institution? We can't give you any money.'
Sue <ORGANIZATION>Townsend</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>1992</DATE> bestseller The Queen and I is a dark joke, a barbed
dream of republicanism in which <PERSON>Mrs Elizabeth Windsor</PERSON> and family learn to
live in the modern hell of a council estate in the <LOCATION>Midlands</LOCATION>. Now it has
become a play, which has just had its premiere, neatly, in the <LOCATION>Midlands</LOCATION> (at
the <LOCATION>Leicester Haymarket</LOCATION>), and will tour <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION> before reaching
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Royal Court</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>June 7</DATE>. The play is different in many details from
the novel. Updated to suit recent Royal developments, and including a few
songs (too few - phew - to qualify it as a musical), it is funny, touching,
shrewd.
Part of the fun of The Queen and I (on page or stage) is to do with Royal
gossip. How would <PERSON>Margaret</PERSON> cope? Philip? The answer in either case is
wickedly amusing. In the stage version the adulterous <PERSON>Charles</PERSON>, who has been
allocated a single person flat, soon shacks up with <PERSON>Leanne</PERSON>, the most
promiscuous girl on the estate, and becomes a good dad to her illegitimate
baby. Diana starts a flirtation with <PERSON>Fitzroy</PERSON>, a local black, and works out
with him ('Once your muscle tone goes, you may as well be dead'). The stage
Queen and I is also mildly feminist: which leads to its funniest scene - a
women's group in which <PERSON>Liz</PERSON>, <PERSON>Diana</PERSON> and neighbours practise assertiveness -
and its best song, What Makes the Husbands Leave Home?' And the fact that
<PERSON>Liz Windsor</PERSON> herself turns out to be matey, outspoken, decent, hard-working,
will please royalists as well as republicans.
But the stage version of The Queen and I is more overtly socialist than the
novel. Some of its stylised versions of gangland chants are trite - a
simplistic effort to understand the gang mentality that sounds in fact
condescending. Elsewhere, however, the realities of council estate life are
caught with realism, as well as humour. It proves both gratifying and
credible (not to mention ironic) that, on her first Christmas Day in her new
home, <PERSON>Mrs Windsor</PERSON> of Hell(ebore) Close, rallies and makes a televised speech
to the nation - no, not the Queen's Speech, de haut en bas, but the reverse:
a pensioner's appeal on behalf of those who, like herself, are making do on
inadequate benefits.
<PERSON>Max Stafford-Clark</PERSON> directs. The fun of all the performances lies less in
their precision of Royal mimicry (though Doon Mackichan makes very witty use
of <LOCATION>Diana</LOCATION>'s tricks with her eyes) than in the impish vigour with which they
bring them to life. Thus <PERSON>Mrs Philomena Toussaint</PERSON> (<PERSON>David Howey</PERSON>) and <PERSON>Mrs Vi
Toby</PERSON> (<PERSON>Carole Hayman</PERSON>) become as vivid to us as their ex-Royal neighbours. The
songs, by <PERSON>Mickey Gallagher</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ian Dury</PERSON>, are the least surefire element of
the show. A certain glee comes from hearing the Windsors and their
neighbours do a rap number, but less than you might hope.
The fine cast is led by <PERSON>Pam Ferris</PERSON> as the <PERSON>Queen</PERSON> - an outstanding
performance. She brings out some surprisingly serious dimensions. Talking
nostalgically to a vision of her old nanny, she suddenly exclaims softly,
'Crawfie - we lived in <ORGANIZATION>Paradise</ORGANIZATION>'. The line - a gentle echo of Lear's 'I have
ta'en too little care of this' - brings a real pang. At the same time, she
is as good as everyone else in the play's element of naughty caricature. The
way she uses her corgi on that Social Services officer (you have to see
this) is the play's funniest moment.
The Queen and I continues at the <LOCATION>Haymarket</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Leicester</LOCATION>, until <DATE>April 16</DATE>. In a
double bill with <PERSON>Jim Cartwright</PERSON>'s Road, it tours to <LOCATION>Bath</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cardiff</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Hull</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>Woking</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Blackpool</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Norwich</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Court Theatre</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.

TENNIS lessons. Chess lessons. My life at present is a whirlwind of
instruction. Yesterday it was a chess lesson, one of a series that I and two
friends are having to prepare ourselves for the <PERSON>Nigel Short-Gary Kasparov</PERSON>
world chess tussle in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> in <DATE>September</DATE>. The two friends are: <PERSON>John Major</PERSON>,

Unusually, the Queen was accompanied by the Seven Dwarfs, her seven Welsh
corgis, who are notorious, at <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION>, for savaging the flunkies.
But the Queen soon settled them. Before the lesson started she produced
seven silver bowls into which she spooned caviar. The dwarfs gobbled it
greedily and collapsed in a malevolent heap.
'That's put paid to them,' she said. '<PERSON>Nigel</PERSON> - let us start. One must get
away on time. There are more ructions brewing - more media allegations.
Where will it all end? Not that one isn't inured. No es para tanto.'
'Right-ho,' said <PERSON>Nigel</PERSON>, whose own mental and physical preparation for his
match against <PERSON>Kasparov</PERSON> the barbarian is proceeding smoothly. 'Today I
thought we'd study sacrificial play in the middle-game, especially
sacrificial play aimed at destroying our opponent's defensive structure.
Remember my golden rule: before launching any sort of attack, sacrificial or
otherwise, always count the number of pieces you will be attacking with and
try to ensure it exceeds the number of pieces your opponent will be
defending with.'
<PERSON>Nigel</PERSON> said he would show us a game he played against Agdestein in <DATE>1987</DATE>,
involving the Greek bishop sacrifice. With grandmasterly finesse he set up
the pieces and moved them at great speed, so that all we could see was a
blur of pawns and bishops and cleverly skulking knights.
'Right,' said <PERSON>Nigel</PERSON>. 'This brings us to move 14. From here, play went: 14,
Bxh7+, Kxh7; 15, Ng5+, Kg8; 16, Qd3, Rfe8. So how did play continue?'
John Major wriggled and frowned. 'I must say, <PERSON>Nigel</PERSON>,' he said, 'that
sacrificial play leaves me with feelings of considerable unease. It does not
seem logical to throw away a perfectly stalwart piece when you are doing
jolly well anyway and embark upon a course of action that is little short of
reckless. It reminds me of politics. I am being urged at the present time to
sacrifice <PERSON>Norman Lamont</PERSON>, my chancellor of the exchequer. But as <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> has
pointed out, alone among his colleagues, <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> is a hero, a man of
considerable stature. Why should I cast him out?'
The Queen trilled with merriment. 'In one's own line of business,' she said,
'one gets accustomed to stratagems, especially mid-game sacrifices. You work
to five-year terms. A monarch thinks in centuries. Qui non proficit deficit.
Anyway, the answer to <PERSON>Nigel</PERSON>'s little teaser is strikingly obvious. What
follows must be: 17, Qh7+, Kf8; 18, f5] . . . '
'Absolutely brill,' said <PERSON>Nigel</PERSON>. 'Exactly how it happened. Then I put the
boot in. It was completely open house.'
'<PERSON>Nigel</PERSON>]' exclaimed the Queen. 'One wishes you hadn't said that. Completely
open house. That is one's current strategem, one's sop to the
anti-monarchists, but one would rather you didn't remind one. Can you
imagine the mess and noise when <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> is thrown open to the
populace this <DATE>summer</DATE>? One is dreading it entirely. And what will they be
gawking at? Just a load of art works, mainly dusty pictures. One is sending
the dwarfs to <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>. They are liable to go berserk.'
I had been quiet until now, but I could not resist the opening. I said: 'I
agree with the character in <PERSON>Barry Unsworth</PERSON>'s novel, <PERSON>Stone Virgin</PERSON>, who says,
in all seriousness, that great works of art are more important than people -
that life can spawn more life, but that you can't spawn Gothic Madonnas.
'Look at the floods in <LOCATION>Venice</LOCATION> in <DATE>1966</DATE>, which triggered off countless
restoration projects and set the money flowing. 'If it hadn't been <LOCATION>Venice</LOCATION>,'
says this character, 'if there had only been people to worry about, what
would anyone have done? I'll tell you. They would have sent a few food
parcels and forgotten all about it'.'
The Queen smiled. She said: '<PERSON>Michael</PERSON> does go on.' She revived the dwarfs
with smelling salts and telephoned for her car and detective. The rest of us
did the same. So ended our second lesson.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Arts: Smashing Pumpkins - Pop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Far below the <ORGANIZATION>Brixton Academy</ORGANIZATION>'s cavernous black ceiling, beneath the shadowy
Italianate mock-buildings that decorate its upper walls, 1,000, perhaps
2,000 young people crush together, often crash together, illuminated
occasionally by harsh white lights from the stage. Bodies rise, feet first,
from this churning sea and are passed from hand to hand before sinking
again. From time to time the mass raise their arms and point as one towards
the front of the stage on which stand three skinny individuals lit in lurid
greens, reds, blues holding guitars.
The noise is overpowering, a screaming, thudding, relentless assault not
just on the ears but on the body. This is the Smashing Pumpkins
emphatically affirming its status as one of the hottest alternative rock
bands. It is a highly enjoyable experience. (Although it helps to have been
put in the mood by security guards whose purpose in life is to stop
passholders seeing the concert.)
What lifts the band above most of its contemporaries is its ability to use
the limited and increasingly hackneyed vocabulary of loud thrash guitar rock
to express a distinctive musical personality.
On Siamese Dream, the latest album, the Pumpkins vary the pace with
moderately complex arrangements, acoustic guitar and even a dash of cello.
Live, such signposts of subletly are abandoned for simple churn and kerrang.
The effect is visceral. The fact that the speakers are so loud that every
bass note feels like a punch in the stomach has something to do with it, but
although other bands play as loud, few are as emotionally engaging.
The assault is not unrelenting. The lull in the storm is one of leader <PERSON>Billy
Corgan</PERSON>'s favourite tricks. The wall of guitar noise from <PERSON>Corgan</PERSON> and <PERSON>James
Iha</PERSON> abates, to expose the powerful skeleton of the Pumpkins' music: the
edgy, sinuous, crunching rhythm of D'Arcy, the bass player, and drummer
<PERSON>Jimmy Chamberlin</PERSON>. The effect can be disconcerting. When 'Today' begins in
relative calm, the audience chants the lyrics with <PERSON>Corgan</PERSON>, a sort of
singalong-a-max-volume, before it builds to a roar that drowns even singing
along in your head.
Each song is distinctly sculpted from the noise and the brief abatement of
noise. Each possesses its own crushing logic. But the ceaseless ebb and flow
in the tidal wave of noise prevents the set as a whole building momentum.
The effect is too controlled. It is a relief when the Pumpkins finish the
set by smashing through '<ORGANIZATION>Cherub Rock</ORGANIZATION>' in one unbroken surge.
The encore is also reassuring. It is a shambles. Corgan emerges in a clown
suit and after 'Spaceboy' - so laid back it even contains some bottleneck
guitar from <PERSON>Iha</PERSON> - the control evaporates halfway through the next song which
starts with a surge of adrenalin and dribbles to an end with <PERSON>Corgan</PERSON>
hectoring the audience in enjoyable ego-crazed rock-star style. After a
confusing final blast of parody power chords they are gone. The audience
seems unsure whether to laugh or cheer and stands as if stunned until
someone turns the house lights on.

   LONDON -- Chief Inspector Jan Eachus stares past thick
bars at the suspect he dragged in the previous night, after a
fierce street fight. The suspect, known only as Bella, glares
back through smoldering black eyes. Bella doesn't have a rap
sheet, but Mr. Eachus knows this isn't her first offense.
"Just look at those scars," he says, pointing at raw marks
across Bella's powerful shoulders. "No question this one's
been in a scrap before."
   Mr. Eachus will tell this to the judge as evidence that
Bella, an American pit bull terrier, shouldn't have been
allowed to roam uncontrolled. Bella's handler could be fined
more than $3,000 or imprisoned for up to six months. Bella,
who ripped open a dachshund's throat and bit its owner's
hand, will pay the ultimate price. "See ya in doggy heaven,"
says Mr. Eachus, watching Bella gnaw at the bars of her cage.
Asked if there's anything a pit bull such as Bella won't
bite, Mr. Eachus responds, "A 747 jetliner -- flight."

<TEXT>
   England is renowned as a nation of dog lovers, a land
where corgis trail <PERSON>Queen Elizabeth II</PERSON> and where shoppers park
their poodles in a carpeted kennel at Harrods department
store. Queen Victoria even shared her deathbed with a
Pomeranian. But <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>'s long affair with dogs has soured.
Aggressive breeds such as pit bulls and Rottweilers are
suddenly in vogue, and as their numbers have risen, so have
reports of dog attacks. The result is public panic,
Parliamentary debate and press headlines suggestive of "The
Hound of the Baskervilles":
   "Devil Dog Scars Tot"
   "Girl, 8, Scalped in Dog Horror."
   England isn't the first country to do battle with
dangerous dogs, but it may be unique in the lethal force it
is deploying. Some animal wardens are arming themselves with
riot shields, chain mail, and ultrasonic stun guns. "Heroes
get bit," explains <PERSON>Mr. Eachus</PERSON>, an inspector with the <ORGANIZATION>Royal
Society</ORGANIZATION> for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (<ORGANIZATION>RSPCA</ORGANIZATION>),
which is often called to handle vicious dogs. In a country
where gun control is so strict that most police go unarmed,
<PERSON>Mr. Eachus</PERSON> is licensed to pack a .32 automatic pistol in his
van.
   "We need that kind of weaponry to control humans, not
dogs," <PERSON>Micky Niego</PERSON>, an official with the <ORGANIZATION>American Society</ORGANIZATION> for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, says of the varied
English arsenal. Some <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> wardens carry tranquilizing darts
and <ORGANIZATION>Mace</ORGANIZATION>, but most prefer nets and rods with loops.
   The English say their situation demands special tactics.
Unlike the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, where rabies has led to tight animal
control, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> is free of the disease and has no dog
licensing, no leash law and, in many areas, no dog wardens.
England's pet-obsessed public also can be feral in defending
animal rights. "The English worry more about the welfare of
poor little pooch than they do about the safety of <PERSON>Joe
Public</PERSON>," says <PERSON>Mr. Eachus</PERSON>, an American who has been living in
<LOCATION>England</LOCATION> since <DATE>1977</DATE>.
   The English also resist the notion that some breeds may be
tough to tame. "People think a little loving care will turn
pit bulls into nice pets," says <PERSON>Roger Mugford</PERSON>, an animal
psychologist in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. "They're wrong." <PERSON>Mr. Mugford</PERSON> echoes
the view of many English experts in describing the dogs as
fearless, almost immune to pain, "and able to turn from
playful jokers into psychopathic killers without a moment's
warning."
   Some dog warriors are taking no chances. Standing beside
her van in the <LOCATION>north England</LOCATION> city of <LOCATION>Bradford</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Pat Harwood</PERSON>
dons the latest in canine battle dress. Long blond curls
vanish beneath a visored helmet designed for riot control by
the <ORGANIZATION>North Atlantic Treaty Organization</ORGANIZATION>. Hands slip into
elbow-length gloves. She cradles a reinforced plastic
"Armadillo Tactical Riot Shield," used by police to repel
missiles. Her tall frame is enveloped by a zip-up jump suit,
lined with chain mesh and heavily padded.
   "I feel like I'm inside a Brillo Pad," says the warden,
her voice muffled by the helmet's visor. <PERSON>Ms. Harwood</PERSON> uses the
suit only for emergencies, but she never patrols without her
"Dazer," a pocket-sized weapon designed to startle dogs with
a high-frequency squeal. "It's important to intimidate," says
her boss, senior warden <PERSON>Terry Singh</PERSON>.
   Some say such gladiators are barking up the wrong tree.
"If you approach a pit bull looking like a creature from
Mars, he's more likely to go berserk and bite you," says
<PERSON>Kevin McNicholas</PERSON>, a veteran <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> dog warden.
   Answering a call on his van's radio phone, <PERSON>Mr. McNicholas</PERSON>
races to a suburban home whose residents are alarmed by a
gnashing sound from an adjoining yard. He finds a huge German
shepherd ripping apart the fence between the two yards with
its fangs. When the dog bounds toward him, <PERSON>Mr. McNicholas</PERSON>
kneels, clicks his tongue and slips a rope around the dog's
neck. "It doesn't need to be <LOCATION>Waterloo</LOCATION> every time you take a
dog in," he says, calmly guiding the animal into his van.
   On another call, an anxious woman points into her
neighbor's yard, where two dummies hang from trees, their
pants legs in shreds. The woman says her neighbors often
stand in the yard shouting "Kill]" as two pit bulls tear the
effigies apart. <PERSON>Mr. McNicholas</PERSON>'s advice: If the dogs come
close, stand perfectly still, avoid eye contact, and, if
possible, whimper like a puppy. "Dog biscuits also help," he
says. The most lethal weapon he has ever employed is a fire
extinguisher. In eight years of service, he hasn't been
bitten.
   Many other officials haven't been so lucky. There were
7,717 dog attacks on mailmen last year; dozens of police were
injured. <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> police also are receiving twice as many calls
about dangerous dogs as they did just six months ago. While
fatal attacks remain rare (one or two a year compared to an
average of 15 in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>), there now are an estimated
500,000 strays on English streets and crowded dog pounds with
cages marked "Mad] Take Care]"
   Despite strong lobbying by police, postmen, the <ORGANIZATION>RSPCA</ORGANIZATION> and
other groups, Parliament narrowly rejected a dog registration
law in <DATE>May</DATE>. But the government now is considering banning
some breeds, or requiring that such dogs be muzzled in
public. "It sounds like hysteria until a Rottweiler chews
your kid to pieces," says <PERSON>Bill Wadman-Taylor</PERSON>, a veterinarian
and head of the Battersea Dogs Home in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Bill Edmond</PERSON>, head of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Kennel Club</ORGANIZATION>, says the <ORGANIZATION>RSPCA</ORGANIZATION>
and other groups are overreacting. "The problem is people,
not dogs," he says. "Irresponsible owners can make any dog
vicious." His organization opposes dog licensing and other
restrictions "because the people who are neglecting their
dogs, or training them to attack, are the very same people
who won't comply with the licensing law."
   The <ORGANIZATION>RSPCA</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Eachus</PERSON> doesn't hesitate to get tough with
both mad dogs and Englishmen. The chain-smoking inspector has
shot two dogs to death and donned riot gear to take in many
others. In his van, he carries a forensic kit containing a
magnifying glass, camera and tweezers to collect evidence
such as dried blood and dogs' hair for use in prosecuting
owners.
   "There's no room for amateurism here," says the veteran
enforcer. He can quote chapter and verse from English dog
law, such as the <DATE>1847</DATE> statute citing owners for "suffering to
be at large a ferocious unmuzzled dog," and more recent laws
regarding the fouling of sidewalks with what some
euphemistically call "dog-logs."
   <PERSON>Mr. Eachus</PERSON> predicts that the craze for pit bulls and other
macho dogs will peak in a few years, as it has in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> In
the meantime, though, "we need to get dangerous dogs off the
street and their owners behind bars," he says.
   Officials fear, however, that another creature may soon
terrorize <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>RSPCA</ORGANIZATION> recently received a panicked
phone call reporting that a wild boar was running amok in a
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> street. It turned out to be a Vietnamese pot-bellied
pig, a faddish pet in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> that is just now reaching
English shores.

   OK, What Rhymes

   Raw Chicken Necks?

   Answer: Dogue de Bordeaux,
   A Breed New to Many
   And a True Power Dog

   NEW YORK -- Douglas Quinn was so taken with the phlegmatic
dog star of the movie "Turner &amp; Hooch" that he took out a
classified ad seeking a "Hooch" pup. "I liked the dog, and I
want it. That's all," says Mr. Quinn, a man of few words and
the father of 3 1/2-year-old twin boys in Barry, Ontario. So
far, no response to the ad.
   Just wait till Mr. Quinn finds out that the gargoyle-faced
dogue de Bordeaux can cost as much as $1,800, weighs 125
pounds and craves 12 pounds of raw chicken necks each day,
plus kibble. "It isn't easy to get chicken necks," concedes
Peter Curley, the breeder who supplied four dogs for the
movie, which also stars Tom Hanks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Mr. Curley</PERSON> adds that though the dogue may have achieved a
certain vogue thanks to <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>, smart (as in fashionable)
doesn't necessarily mean smart (as in intelligent). "The only
thing you can train the <LOCATION>Bordeaux</LOCATION> to do is eat and sleep,"
says <PERSON>Mr. Curley</PERSON>, who now is branching out to an even rarer
breed: the presa de Canario, known as "the gripping dog" of
the <LOCATION>Canary Islands</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Curley</PERSON> expects that strong-jawed
beast to be popular at dog shows and to command maybe <MONEY>$2,500</MONEY>.
   The <LOCATION>Bordeaux</LOCATION> and the presa are power dogs -- not mere pets
but status symbols. "I'm sure it happens that there are
people who buy dogs like they buy cars," says <PERSON>Peter L.
Borchelt</PERSON>, an animal psychologist in <LOCATION>Forest Hills</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>
   <PERSON>Carol Lea Benjamin</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> author whose book
"Second-Hand Dog" is a paean to the mongrel, notes that
"breeds are often chosen because somebody famous has one" --
the president of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, say, or an admired movie star.
Appreciating that fact, the <ORGANIZATION>International Kennel Club</ORGANIZATION>, which
is really just a pet store in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>, sometimes manages to
plant items in the gossip columns disclosing that an actor --
<PERSON>Bruce Willis</PERSON>, for instance -- is taking delivery of some
Akita pups or that singer <PERSON>Roberta Flack</PERSON> has a fox-faced shiba
inu. Gilt by association, in other words. It is supposed to
move dogs, and it undoubtedly does.
   People magazine recently predicted that the bichon frise,
a bit of fluff whose name means curly- haired lap-dog, will
be one of the top five dogs of the <DATE>1990s</DATE>, "style-wise." And
in no time at all, <PERSON>Tina Geores</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> breeder, was
advertising it as "the most stylish dog of the '90s."
   <PERSON>Ms. Geores</PERSON> claims the bichon is getting more and more
popular "with very trendy people, people in show business,"
people like <PERSON>Carly Simon</PERSON>, the singer and songwriter. "They are
such a pleasant little dog," <PERSON>Ms. Geores</PERSON> says. "They're easy
to travel with. They're easy to live with." They cost between
<MONEY>$650</MONEY> and <MONEY>$1,200</MONEY>.
   The authoritative <ORGANIZATION>American Kennel Club</ORGANIZATION>, which is not a pet
store in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>, is a little slower on the uptake than
readers of People. It recognizes only 130 breeds, and the
<LOCATION>Bordeaux</LOCATION> and shiba inu aren't two of them. The <ORGANIZATION>AKC</ORGANIZATION> each year
lists the top 10 breeds (in terms of registrations), and most
are not exotic power dogs. Cockers and Labs, poodles, golden
retrievers and German shepherds head the list, in that order,
although two currently fashionable breeds, Rottweiler and
chow chow (chow for short), do make the latest top 10.
   "The <PERSON>Rotty</PERSON> is the guard dog of the moment," says <PERSON>John
Mandeville</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>AKC</ORGANIZATION> judging official. He says the bear-faced
chow is probably the "pre-eminent fad dog." <PERSON>Mr. Mandeville</PERSON>
notes that both dogs tend to be hard to handle, particularly
if they aren't well trained and if the owner isn't assertive.
But, he says, many breed-conscious masters unfortunately
can't see past the pup. "If there's anything cuter than an
eight- or 10-week-old chow puppy, I'm not sure what it is,"
he says. But then one day, the dog owner wakes up to find a
giant, shedding beast (with a blue tongue in the case of the
chow) who wants to be boss. "Cute" can easily enough turn
into "trouble."
   That hasn't kept <ORGANIZATION>AKC</ORGANIZATION> registrations from reaching an
all-time high, as more Americans seek to spend their mad
money on the perfect dog. The dogue de <LOCATION>Bordeaux</LOCATION> may not be
it, for a variety of reasons, one of which is that it
originally was bred as a fighting dog. It is said to be good
with children. But it might just have the neighbor's shih tzu
for lunch.
   The border collie (like <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> the Dog in the film "Down and
Out in <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>") is a current favorite. So are
bulldogs. <PERSON>Jack Russell</PERSON> terriers are popular with the horsy
set. The short-legged Welsh corgi is big (<ORGANIZATION>Queen Elizabeth II</ORGANIZATION>
has at least one). And so, of course, is the English bull
terrier (thanks to <ORGANIZATION>Anheuser-Busch</ORGANIZATION>, Bud Light and <ORGANIZATION>Spuds
MacKenzie</ORGANIZATION>).
   <PERSON>Barbara Bush</PERSON> and the president have been good for English
springer spaniels. Theirs -- <PERSON>Millie</PERSON> and her pups -- have been
good for the Bushes politically. (Yes, <PERSON>Messrs. Reagan</PERSON>, <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Roosevelt</PERSON> had famous dogs, too.) <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> gave
this advice to a Republican running for <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>:
"One single word. Puppies. Worth 10 points."
   Like politicians, dog breeds have their moment. But the
popular ones get overbred, by puppy mills and others trying
to take advantage of demand. "With anything trendy, there's a
rush to breed for profit," says <PERSON>Mr. Borchelt</PERSON>, the animal
psychologist. "That's no good." Puppy mills turn out dogs
with physical and psychological problems, dogs that can't
handle their aggressive impulses, dogs that bite.
   And ultimately a breed will pass out of fashion, as the
shar-pei seems to be doing now. It is that wrinkly creature
which, as a pup, looks more like a pile of sweat shirts than
a dog.
   On a tour of the Animal Medical Center in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr.
Borchelt</PERSON> is interrupted twice by veterinarians seeking his
advice about their patients. An elderly woman has a "nervous
chow," says one. The other confides: "I've got a problem with
an aggressive shar-pei."
   The Chinese shar-pei, or "sand-skin," was nearly extinct
in the <DATE>1950s</DATE>. But, <DATE>two decades later</DATE>, it caught on with the
rare-dog breeders and, in <DATE>1983</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Neiman Marcus Christmas</ORGANIZATION>
catalog featured a pair of shar-pei pups -- at <MONEY>$2,000</MONEY> each.
The rage began. Today there are more than 50,000 shar-peis.
The price has come down to as little as <MONEY>$100</MONEY>, a sign that the
fad is about played out. And that's only the half of it.
   "The shar-pei is a veterinarian's dream," says <PERSON>Michael
Marder</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> vet. "I'm seeing a lot of health and
behavioral problems, not life-threatening but chronic," he
says. Skin trouble is especially common.
   <PERSON>Ethel Petry</PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION>Central Point</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, is familiar from an
owner's standpoint with the shar-pei's potential for
ailments. She chose her shar-pei puppy largely because his
front paws were "broken down," and she was afraid the
flat-footed dog would be destroyed.
   Timothy, now three years old, cost her a hundred bucks.
But he was no bargain. His doctor bills have been at least
five times that. He contracted a bad case of mange, and he
tends to be sickly. "He can be playing with you one minute,"
<PERSON>Ms. Petry</PERSON> says, "and come down with a temperature of 104
degees the next."
   Efforts to fix the dog's feet failed, and the little pads
on his paws never toughened up. So, "<PERSON>Timothy</PERSON> is a grass-dog.
I never walk him on the street," says his owner. He travels
by car from his backyard to the park for outings. And at
least once, <PERSON>Ms. Petry</PERSON> has had to carry <PERSON>Timothy</PERSON> in her arms to
keep him off the pavement. Still, she says, "We get along."
   Fortunately, passe power dogs seldom seem to end up at the
pound, abandoned by owners who have traded up to a newer
model. <PERSON>Marjorie Stein</PERSON>, manager of adoption services for the
<ORGANIZATION>North Shore Animal League</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Port Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, says she
sees few of the exotic breeds: "A chichi dog has a much
better chance of getting a home by word of mouth. Generally,
somebody wants it."

FT  29 AUG 92 / Please leave me alone, Fergie: Dominic Lawson wishes the
royals would stop interfering with him

<TEXT>
'THIS 'royal tapes' business is the last straw,' said my taxi driver, and I
had to agree. The ever-encroaching invasion of privacy must cease. It is
time that the royal family stopped intruding on our private lives. We may be
only subjects but even under a monarchy we have some rights, above all the
right to be left alone to lead our private lives in peace and quiet, away
from the glare of royal publicity.
The monarch herself, of course, we cannot avoid. Every time we attach a
stamp to an envelope we are obliged to lick the back of the Queen's head, as
if we were a corgi seeking an approving royal pat. Falling asleep at the end
of the day's television on BBC1, one is obliged to wake up and stand to
attention as the national anthem is played at full blast by the <ORGANIZATION>BBC Symphony
Orchestra</ORGANIZATION>, whose members, I gather, call the tune 'royalties'.
Then there are the intrusive royal garden parties. We live near <LOCATION>Buckingham
Palace</LOCATION>, so perhaps I am unduly sensitive. But none of our other neighbours,
not even the inhabitants of <LOCATION>Victoria</LOCATION>'s numerous bail hostels, cause as much
local disturbance and disruption.
Of course one can leave <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> to avoid the din around the Palace. We favour
the south of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, around <ORGANIZATION>St Tropez</ORGANIZATION>. But this year the <ORGANIZATION>Duchess of York</ORGANIZATION> and
her financial adviser got there first, and the place now resembles
Bedlam-by-the-sea.
I cannot understand why, when members of the royal family can stay in
countless castles, all with walls high enough to hide behind and thick
enough to soundproof the most amorous affairs, some of their number should
still choose to cavort in a way which we cannot help but see, in gruesome
colour, all over our servants' newspapers.
Worse still was the return of the errant duchess. Again, perhaps I have been
unlucky, but did she and her exuberant friends have to make such a din at
Foxtrot Oscar while we were trying to enjoy a quiet dinner next door at
Tante Claire?
I suppose the rot started in the <DATE>1960s</DATE>, when the Queen - doubtless following
bad advice, rather than acting on her own sound instincts - agreed to make
the royal household into media stars with the <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> film The Family. Suddenly
these remote and austere figures intruded for the first time into our homes,
like uninvited house guests.
In recent years this publicity-seeking has developed in a distinctly
down-market direction. We had the <ORGANIZATION>Duchess of York</ORGANIZATION>'s characteristically
bizarre television promotion, It's a Royal Knock-Out, not to mention the
interminably over-promoted Budgie the Helicopter books.
While the Prince of <LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION>'s publications have been less intrusive, indeed
tastefully obscure, it came as a shock to turn on one's television to see
the heir to the throne cavorting about in the highlands and islands with the
popular TV personality <PERSON>Selina Scott</PERSON>. I would not question the prince's
choice of companion - I, too, consider <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> to be a woman of rare beauty
and intelligence - but could not the future king have left us in peace,
rather than forced us to watch the two of them at peak-time and grind our
teeth in envy at his good fortune? To encourage such resentment is to foment
revolution and the overthrow of the monarchy.
But, as the taxi driver said, the saga of the royal tapes is the final
straw. I have no idea whether the tape purporting to be of the Princess of
<LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION> talking to a male admirer is in fact a recording of the princess's
voice or not, and the official line from the palace is that they have no
idea either.
But let us suppose that the tape is genuine, as The Sun claims. Surely the
royal family with its enormous and untaxed wealth, can afford a private
telephone exchange. Surely they realise how easy it is to get a crossed line
on <ORGANIZATION>British Telecom</ORGANIZATION>'s outmoded system. How many innocent members of the
general public must over the years have suffered the irritation of suddenly
hearing snatches of conversation between members of the royal family who
ought to know better.
No wonder a retired bank manager, exasperated at having his calls
interrupted, finally lost his temper, recorded his latest crossed royal
line, and handed it to The Sun.
Perhaps this incident will finally teach the royal family their lesson. If
they will only go back to their castles, fill their moats, pull up their
drawbridges and leave us alone, then we will once again love, cherish and
admire them.
God Save The Queen.

   Crowds of fans, some of whom had camped out overnight to get a

<HEAD>Tower Of Windsor Castle Damaged By Shifting Foundations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDSOR, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 800-year-old Round Tower at <ORGANIZATION>Windsor
Castle</ORGANIZATION>, one of Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth II</PERSON>'s homes, has been damaged by
shifting foundations, the <ORGANIZATION>Department of the Environment</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>today</DATE>.
   The castle overlooking the <LOCATION>River Thames</LOCATION> is reportedly the
queen's favorite home and is one of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s top tourist
attractions. The monarch's royal standard is flown from the tower
when she is in residence.
   ``There has been a slight movement to the Round Tower at <ORGANIZATION>Windsor
Castle</ORGANIZATION>. We are looking into it,'' the government department said in
a brief statement.
   The statement added that the cause was not known and gave no
details about the extent of the damage.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Daily Telegraph</ORGANIZATION>, which first broke the story, described the
damage to the five-story tower as serious following a shift in its
ancient foundations.
   The <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> newspaper said the tower moved two weeks ago,
bringing down plaster, causing cracks to appear in the stonework
and jamming a door and two windows.
   It said the queen had inspected the tower. <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION>
said in a statement: ``The queen is obviously concerned and is
being kept informed.''
   The queen and her husband, <PERSON>Prince Philip</PERSON>, live for much of the
year at <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> but they and their family spend
each Christmas at <ORGANIZATION>Windsor Castle</ORGANIZATION>. Windsor is 21 miles west of
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
   The Round Tower is the most imposing feature of the castle. The
foundations of the tower and the rest of its lower part were built
by <ORGANIZATION>King Henry II</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1172</DATE>. The upper part was added 6{ centuries
later in the reign of <ORGANIZATION>King George IV</ORGANIZATION>.
   The Round Tower is built on a mound thrown up by the Saxons, the
Teutonic invaders who conquered <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> between the 5th and 7th
centuries. They ruled until their army under <PERSON>King Harold</PERSON> was beaten
at the <ORGANIZATION>Battle of Hastings</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1066</DATE> by <PERSON>Duke William</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Normandy</LOCATION>, who
then became King William I of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>.
   The original castle was built by <ORGANIZATION>King William</ORGANIZATION> around 1070.

<HEAD>Bush Samples Splendor of Palace and Smiles At Queen's Command</HEAD>

   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> had lunch with <PERSON>Queen Elizabeth II</PERSON>
on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, sampled the splendor of <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> and smiled
for the cameras at her majesty's command.
   The royal event began with a glitch over the delayed opening of
<PERSON>Barbara Bush</PERSON>'s car door, but by the time lunch ended 30 minutes
behind schedule there were smiles all around and the queen told the
president: ``I hope to see you again soon.''
   When the presidential limousine pulled up to the palace's
red-carpeted <ORGANIZATION>Grand Entrance</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> jumped out. But nobody opened
<PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON>'s door until the queen, frowning and shaking her head,
raised her voice and said: ``Open it.''
   A <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Secret Service</ORGANIZATION> agent complied immediately and <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON>,
wearing an emerald green dress, emerged smiling as though nothing
had happened.
   It was the Bushes' first taste of British royal hospitality and
the queen and her husband, <PERSON>Prince Philip</PERSON>, brought out one of
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s biggest tourist attractions _ the <ORGANIZATION>2nd Battalion Scots
Guards</ORGANIZATION> in their red tunics and bearskin hats.
   The president arrived at <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> from talks with Prime
Minister <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON> at her Downing Street residence.
Escorted by <LOCATION>Philip</LOCATION>, he inspected a 100-strong honor guard mounted
by the <ORGANIZATION>Scots Guards</ORGANIZATION> after their band played the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> national
anthem.
   ``That was so beautiful,'' <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> told his hosts. ``I have never
heard `The Star-Spangled Banner' being played better.''
   Then he added hastily: ``with all respect to the <ORGANIZATION>Marine</ORGANIZATION> band.''
   Both couples then went inside, chatting animatedly as they
walked through a few of the palace's 600 rooms on their way to
cocktails with the 30 other luncheon guests.
   Between cocktails and lunch, the Bushes and their royal hosts
slipped out for a quick look at the mainly 17th century Dutch
masterpieces in the palace picture gallery.
   ``It's just us. It's very quiet,'' <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said in a joking
reference to the cocktail hubbub he left behind.
   As they approached photographers, the queen, wearing a blue and
white striped silk dress, told <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> with a grin: ``Smile.'' He
obeyed.
   Luncheon was served in the ivory and gold Music Room overlooking
the 45-acre palace garden. The magnificent domed room with 18 blue
and gilt columns has been used for many royal christenings
including those of Prince <PERSON>Charles</PERSON>, the heir to the throne, and
<PERSON>Charles</PERSON>' heir, <PERSON>Prince William</PERSON>.
   Flanked by the queen and Prime Minister <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>
sat down to a meal of smoked salmon mousse, duck with honey and
brandy sauce, broad beans, asparagus and potatoes, artichoke salad
and mango ice cream.
   The three wines included two which the queen served Soviet
leader <PERSON>Mikhail S. Gorbachev</PERSON> and his wife <PERSON>Raisa</PERSON> when they lunched
together at <ORGANIZATION>Windsor Castle</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>April</DATE>. They are an Alsatian white
Gewurztraminer Dopff <DATE>1983</DATE> and the queen's private port, Royal
Vintage <DATE>1955</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> said the queen's choice of wines was
``coincidence.''
   The guests included <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON>'s husband <PERSON>Denis</PERSON>, Secretary of
State <PERSON>James Baker III</PERSON>, his British counterpart Sir <PERSON>Geoffrey Howe</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Terry Hands</PERSON>, artistic director of the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Shakespeare Theater</ORGANIZATION>,
and <PERSON>Charles Wilson</PERSON>, editor of The Times of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
   When former President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> went to <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> just a
year ago for tea with the queen, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> television reporter shouted
questions to him, breeching accepted behavior at formal royal
occasions.
   To avoid a repetition, reporters at the entrance were made to
stand behind a sound-proof glass screen.

   <PERSON>Mikhail Gorbachev</PERSON> today had lunch with
<PERSON>Queen Elizabeth II</PERSON> at <LOCATION>Windsor Castle</LOCATION> and invited her to visit the
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.
   Her office said the queen told <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> she would like to
accept, but her foreign travel is fixed years in advance.
   She would be the first British sovereign to visit the <LOCATION>Soviet
Union</LOCATION> since the Russian royal family, her cousins, were murdered
after the <DATE>1917</DATE> Bolshevik revolution.
   ``Thanking <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON>, Her Majesty explained that the program
for her visits were fixed a number of years in advance. She hoped
it would be possible to visit the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> in due course,'' a
<ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> statement said.
   The announcement came as the Soviet leader left <LOCATION>Windsor Castle</LOCATION>
for <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Heathrow Airport</LOCATION> to return home at the end of a
40-hour visit to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.
   Earlier, <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> and his wife <PERSON>Raisa</PERSON> drove to the majestic
castle on the <LOCATION>Thames River</LOCATION> in drizzling rain.
   Maj. <PERSON>Nicholas Parsons</PERSON> invited the <ORGANIZATION>Kremlin</ORGANIZATION> leader in fluent
Russian to inspect a guard of honor of bearskin-capped <ORGANIZATION>Coldstream
Guards</ORGANIZATION>.
   The queen, in bright pink skirt and cape, and her husband,
<PERSON>Prince Philip</PERSON>, greeted her guests on the castle doorstep.
   <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> was the first Soviet leader since <DATE>1967</DATE> to meet the
queen, and by putting the royal seal on his 40-hour visit to
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, he clearly hoped to enhance the benign image he is trying
to implant in <LOCATION>Western</LOCATION> minds.
   <ORGANIZATION>Windsor Castle</ORGANIZATION>, the palace 20 miles west of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, has been a
royal residence for more than 800 years, and the queen took the
Gorbachevs on a tour of some of its rooms and held a lunch in their
honor.
   The 34 guests, including Prime Minister <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON> and
her husband <PERSON>Denis</PERSON>, ate smoked salmon cornets filled with crabmeat,
layers of fillet of beef, duck puree and sliced artichoke, all
baked in pastry.
   Earlier today, <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> delivered a major televised policy
speech in the oak-paneled, chandeliered splendor of <LOCATION>Guildhall</LOCATION>, for
800 years the seat of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> city government.
   Like many of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s archaic institutions, the <ORGANIZATION>Guildhall</ORGANIZATION>'s
power is more in its looks than in its powers. Like Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth
II</PERSON>, the Guildhall and its lord mayor are restricted largely to
ceremonial duties.
   The Gorbachevs arrived at the <ORGANIZATION>Guildhall</ORGANIZATION> in a 24-car motorcade
through the congested streets of the <LOCATION>City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s financial
district, where the lord mayor, <PERSON>Alderman</PERSON> Sir <PERSON>Christopher Collett</PERSON>,
waited, resplendent in black, gold-braided robes and three-corner
hat.
   <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> was escorted into the building in a procession led by
the mayor, the sergeant at arms and officials bearing a sword and a
gold mace, symbol of city authority.
   A trumpet fanfare announced the Gorbachevs' entry into the hall,
and they stood beside <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> and her husband <PERSON>Denis</PERSON> as the
Soviet and British anthems were played.
   An array of dignitaries packed the hall, ranging across the
political spectrum from <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> through Archbishop of
Canterbury <PERSON>Robert Runcie</PERSON> to <PERSON>Bruce Kent</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Campaign
for Nuclear Disarmament</ORGANIZATION>.
   Pikemen, musketeers, sheriffs and city elders in blue robes
stood by to complete the pageant.

<HEAD>Intruder Arrested In Buckingham Palace Mews</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drunken youth penetrated security devices
designed to protect the royal family and was arrested about 200
yards from <LOCATION>Buckingham Palace</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION> Yard said early <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   The Yard, headquarters of the metropolitan police, said the
incident occurred <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>. It said no further action was
planned against the youth, who was released after being cautioned
for being drunk and disorderly.
   The Yard declined to give the youth's name, address or age. It
also would not detail how he got into the royal mews, which serves
as stable and garage for <ORGANIZATION>Queen Elizabeth II</ORGANIZATION>'s 30 carriage horses,
coaches and cars.
   He was arrested in the mews, about 200 yards from the palace.
   The mews is normally entered from <LOCATION>Buckingham Palace Road</LOCATION> through
a huge pair of doors set in a high wall topped with spikes, barbed
wire, alarms and remote control cameras.
   The palace said the queen was not at <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> at the
time of the intrusion.
   She was at <ORGANIZATION>Windsor Castle</ORGANIZATION>, 21 miles west of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, where the
royal family often prefers to spend weekends.
   Security at 650-room <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> and its 45 acres of
grounds was improved after an unemployed drifter, <PERSON>Michael Fagan</PERSON>,
climbed a drainpipe in <DATE>1982</DATE> to reach the queen's bedroom, sat on
her bed and spoke to her before he was nabbed.
   A jury found <PERSON>Fagan</PERSON> innocent of stealing a bottle of Californian
wine which he drank during a break-in at the palace earlier in
<DATE>1982</DATE>. He was never charged with breaking in to the palace because
it was regarded as trespassing, a civil offense, and the palace
wouldn't take him to court.

   <PERSON>Mikhail S. Gorbachev</PERSON> followed in the
footsteps of the czars and came to <PERSON>Queen Elizabeth II</PERSON>'s castle on
<DATE>Friday</DATE>, then asked the question Britons have been speculating about
for months.
   He asked the monarch if she would come to <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>. Prime Minister
<PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON> said the queen gave ``a very definite yes.''
   Winding up his two-day visit, the Soviet leader sampled
old-fashioned British pageantry _ first in the oak-paneled splendor
of the <LOCATION>Guildhall</LOCATION>, for 800 years the seat of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> city government,
then in majestic <LOCATION>Windsor Castle</LOCATION> overlooking the <LOCATION>River Thames</LOCATION>.
   Elizabeth will be the first British monarch to visit the <LOCATION>Soviet
Union</LOCATION> since the revolution that ousted the czars and brought the
communists to power.
   The invitation has great implications because of the close
kinship of the Russian and British royal families. Czar <PERSON>Nicholas
II</PERSON>, a cousin of the queen's grandfather, was murdered with his
family in <DATE>1918</DATE>, ending the <LOCATION>Romanov</LOCATION> dynasty.
   The queen's reaction sounded somewhat guarded. A <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham
Palace</ORGANIZATION> statement said: ``Thanking <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON>, Her Majesty
explained that the program for her visits were fixed a number of
years in advance. She hoped it would be possible to visit the
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> in due course.''
   But <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON>, whose government has the final word on
approving or rejecting a visit, said: ``It's a very definite yes.''
She added the queen was ``very positive, very glad, very happy''
about the invitation.
   In <DATE>November</DATE>, a month before <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> originally was scheduled
to visit <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, reports of a Soviet prospective invitation to the
queen started circulating and <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> let it be known she
thought it was too soon to give such a resounding stamp of approval
to the Soviet leader's reform plans.
   At a news conference in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, Soviet officials
were asked whether the palace or British government had insisted
the Soviets apologize for the treatment of the Russian royal family
before the queen accepted the invitation.
   Yevgeny Primakov of the <ORGANIZATION>Soviet Institute of World Economic and
International Politics</ORGANIZATION> said there were ``no preconditions on either
side.''
   He said Soviets are reasessing their history but added: ``This
is not the point. This is an invitation to a head of state of a
country with which we are trying to find points of convergence.''
   <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> was driven to <LOCATION>Windsor Castle</LOCATION>, 21 miles west of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>
_ the first Soviet leader since <DATE>1967</DATE> to visit the queen.
   In drizzling rain, he took the Royal Salute from the Guard of
Honor mounted by the <ORGANIZATION>1st Battalion Coldstream Guards</ORGANIZATION>. The captain
then reported to <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> in Russian and the Soviet leader,
carrying his hat in his hand, reviewed the troops clad in gray
greatcoats and bearskin hats.
   The queen, wearing a pink cape and matching skirt, then took
<PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON>Raisa</PERSON>, on a quick tour of the palace _ past
relics from the <LOCATION>Crusades</LOCATION>, medieval knights on horseback, <PERSON>King Henry
VIII</PERSON>'s suit of armor, and a painting of the Russian Emperor
<PERSON>Alexander I. Gorbachev</PERSON> beamed in recognition.
   The party made a brief detour to enable <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> to look at a
malachite vase given to Queen Victoria by Czar <PERSON>Nicholas I.
   Nicholas</PERSON> I was the first of the czarist cousins to come to
<LOCATION>Windsor</LOCATION>, spending three days in <DATE>June 1844</DATE> as <LOCATION>Victoria</LOCATION>'s guest.
Alexander II, the future <PERSON>Alexander III</PERSON>, and the future <PERSON>Nicholas II</PERSON>,
were also entertained at <LOCATION>Windsor</LOCATION> by the British royals.
   <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> invited the queen to visit the
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> over a lunch of smoked salmon, pastry filled with
layers of beef, duck puree and artichoke and avocado salad, and
three wines.
   The 34 guests included <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON>Denis</PERSON>, and
the queen's youngest son, <PERSON>Prince Edward</PERSON>, who will be visiting
<LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> next week with the <ORGANIZATION>National Youth Theater</ORGANIZATION>.
   Lord <ORGANIZATION>St. John of Fawsley</ORGANIZATION>, a constitutional expert, said the
invitation ``will cement the very warm relationship between
ourselves and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>. I think it will put an end to all
tensions that could have come from the memories of the
assassination of the czar and I think the queen will have a very
ecstatic reception.''
   <PERSON>Harold Brooks-Baker</PERSON>, publishing director of <PERSON>Burke</PERSON>'s peerage,
said the queen should insist that the Soviets disclose where Czar
<PERSON>Nicolas II</PERSON> and his family are buried, and that she be allowed to
pay her respects.
   ``The fact that the queen could see the graves of her relations,
and repair the damage done after the Russian Revolution in a
Christian and religious way, would perhaps bring these countries
closer together than anyone ever thought possible,'' he said.

<HL> Technology: AT&amp;T Computer Business Gets Big Boost --- Massive Air Force Contract Bolsters Firm in Battle Over Standards for Unix </HL>

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s computer business and its Unix operating system got a big boost <DATE>Friday</DATE> when the company won an estimated <MONEY>$929 million</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> contract. 

   The award provides <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION> with much-needed credibility in the computer industry, analysts said, and is likely to be used by the telephone giant as a major marketing tool. 
<ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION> executives said the contract with options runs for eight years and could be worth more than <MONEY>$4.5 billion</MONEY> if the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Department</ORGANIZATION> and civilian agencies order their authorized limits for equipment, software and services. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> contract, one of the government's largest computer orders ever, had been closely watched by the computer industry. 
The size of the contract helped create a major industry fight over future computer standards, because the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> required bidders to offer systems compatible with Unix, an operating system developed and licensed by <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION> that has become increasingly popular as the base level of software controlling operations on engineering workstations, many minicomputers and some personal computers. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Digital Equipment Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Wang Laboratories Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, for instance, didn't bid after protesting against the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION>'s requirement of compatibility with <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION>'s latest version of Unix-Unix System <PERSON>V. 

   Robert Kavner</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Data Systems Group</ORGANIZATION>, said he hopes the contract will help <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION> reach an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION>Open Software Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, a computer group challenging the company's control of Unix. 
The group has pledged to develop a system using <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s Unix version, <LOCATION>AIX</LOCATION>, which isn't fully compatible with <ORGANIZATION>Unix System V. AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION>, in turn, has formed a group to push Unix System V. 

   "This bid doesn't decide the entire marketplace," <PERSON>Mr. Kavner</PERSON> said. 
"But it is an incremental affirmation of our operating system. 
I hope those in <ORGANIZATION>OSF</ORGANIZATION> will continue to ship Unix System V and feel more and more comfortable it's the route to go." 

   How much business <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION> actually will get from the contract isn't clear. 
Capt. <PERSON>Warren Sypher</PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force Communications Command</ORGANIZATION>, which announced the contract, said he understood its value to be <MONEY>$929 million</MONEY> over eight years. 
However, <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION> executives said that the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> agencies covered by the contract are authorized to spend about <MONEY>$4.5 billion</MONEY>, and that the <MONEY>$929 million</MONEY> estimate covers only the first two years. 

   Whatever its final value, the win gives <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION>'s computer business a shot in the arm. 
<ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION>'s current computer revenue is about <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> annually, analysts estimate, and the unit, which has had losses totaling <MONEY>billions of dollars</MONEY>, isn't expected to become profitable until late next year at the earliest. 

   "They certainly need whatever they can get" in computer orders, said <PERSON>Richard Toole</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch &amp; Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
"But I really think their problems in computers will have to be solved by acquisition." 
<PERSON>Mr. Kavner</PERSON> said the contract will help <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Data Systems Group</ORGANIZATION> turn profitable sooner than his budget now plans. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> officials said <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Planning Research Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Honeywell Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Lockheed Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Zenith Electronics Corp.</ORGANIZATION> also bid on the contract. 
One <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said bidding was so competitive that prices were cut by <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT>; the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> originally estimated its initial purchases would cost <MONEY>$3.5 billion</MONEY>, the spokesman said. 

   An <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the computer giant is disappointed it didn't win. 
"We are going to ask the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> for a debriefing to understand why," the spokesman said. 
Any protests would be filed with the <ORGANIZATION>General Services Administration</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> officials said. 

   <PERSON>Warren G. Corgan</PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Federal Systems Division</ORGANIZATION>, said the contract operates as a catalog, with <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION> supplying a list of about 250 items, including <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION>'s 3B2/600 minicomputers, software, maintenance, systems integration and other work. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Defense Department</ORGANIZATION> agencies will buy the estimated <MONEY>$929 million</MONEY> of gear in the first two years, but can continue buying hardware for an additional three years and maintenance for an additional six years, <PERSON>Mr. Corgan</PERSON> said. 
<ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION> has been asked to ship the first 16 minicomputers to the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> by <DATE>Jan. 3</DATE>, he said. 
The agencies may buy as many as 20,000 <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION> minicomputers, according to <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Meanwhile, <PERSON>Mr. Corgan</PERSON> said, civilian agencies can select items from the catalog after the first year of the contract. 
He estimated that buying by civilian agencies could boost purchases by <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> above the <MONEY>$4.6 billion</MONEY> of authorized spending by <ORGANIZATION>Defense Department</ORGANIZATION> agencies. 

   <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION> executives said about <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT> of the revenue from the contract will be for <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION> items, which it will start shipping in volume in next year's second quarter. 
<ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION> also will supply the government with gear and services from other companies. 
<ORGANIZATION>Control Data Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, for instance, will supply magnetic disk drives, and <ORGANIZATION>TRW Inc.</ORGANIZATION> will supply engineering and networks linking computers. 

   <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION> last won a major government computer contract three years ago, when it beat <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> for a three-year contract from the <ORGANIZATION>National Security Agency</ORGANIZATION> with an estimated value at the time of <MONEY>$946 million</MONEY>. 
"This contract dwarfs the <ORGANIZATION>NSA</ORGANIZATION> contract," <PERSON>Mr. Corgan</PERSON> said. 

   In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION> shares rose <MONEY>75 cents</MONEY> to close at <MONEY>$28</MONEY>.

   Princess <PERSON>Beatrice</PERSON>, the 3-month-old daughter of the
<ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Duchess of York</ORGANIZATION>, will be christened by the <ORGANIZATION>Archbishop of
York</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Dec. 20</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   The christening will take place in the historic Chapel Royal in
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>St. James</LOCATION>'s Palace, where <PERSON>Queen Victoria</PERSON> and <PERSON>Prince Albert</PERSON>
were married in <DATE>1840</DATE> and where royal christenings occasionally have
taken place.
   Princess <PERSON>Beatrice Elizabeth Mary</PERSON>, fifth in line to the throne and
the fifth grandchild of Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth II</PERSON>, will wear the royal
family's christening robe of Honiton lace and will be baptized at
the silver gilt <PERSON>Lily Font</PERSON>, the palace said.
   The font was made for the christening in <DATE>1840</DATE> of <LOCATION>Princess
Victoria</LOCATION>, the eldest child of <PERSON>Queen Victoria</PERSON>, and it has been used
to baptize <PERSON>Queen Elizabeth</PERSON>'s four children and grandchildren. The
christening robe has been worn by all royal babies since the baptism
of <LOCATION>Victoria</LOCATION>'s eldest son, <PERSON>Prince Albert Edward</PERSON>, in <DATE>1842</DATE>.
   The christening will take place shortly after the princess'
father, <PERSON>Prince Andrew</PERSON>, returns to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION>Royal Navy</ORGANIZATION> lieutenant,
he is serving on board the destroyer <LOCATION>Edinburgh</LOCATION> which has been in the
<LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION>.
   Princess <PERSON>Beatrice</PERSON>, born <DATE>Aug. 8</DATE>, is the first child of the prince,
the queen's second son, and the former <PERSON>Sarah Ferguson</PERSON>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> said the royal couple chose <PERSON>Dr. John Habgood</PERSON>,
the archbishop of <LOCATION>York</LOCATION> and second-ranking prelate in the Church of
<LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, rather than the <ORGANIZATION>Archbishop of Canterbury</ORGANIZATION>, the church's
spiritual leader, to christen their daughter because of ``personal
and appropriate'' reasons.
   The queen, as <ORGANIZATION>Princess Elizabeth of York</ORGANIZATION>, was also christened by
the then- archbishop of <LOCATION>York</LOCATION> but in the chapel at <LOCATION>Buckingham Palace</LOCATION>.

<LEADPARA>  Is she or isn't she the world's richest woman? And should she or shouldn't she
pay taxes on her income, just like everyone else? Those brash questions about
Queen Elizabeth II were raised in Parliament this week by Liberal Party Member
of Parliament Simon Hughes, in a move that reflected the opinion of a majority
of citizens.;    More than 70 percent of the British, polls show, believe her
income should be subject to taxes. Or as Hughes put it, "When so many people
in my (London) constituency are scraping along and asked to contribute tax on
very low incomes, it seems grossly unfair that the person with the highest
income escapes. And there's no reason a modern constitutional monarch
shouldn't pay taxes."  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  COUNTING QUEEN ELIZABETH'S MILLIONS
ESTIMATES PLACE MONARCH'S WEALTH AT $7.4
BILLION  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The queen's personal net worth has long been a matter of considerable
speculation and argument, since, unlike <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> heads of state, she is not
required to make public the amount of her wealth and she has not volunteered
the information. Estimates range on the high side -- Fortune magazine
estimates it at <MONEY>$7.4 billion</MONEY>, with an annual income of perhaps <MONEY>$3 million</MONEY> a
day; <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> snorts that such a sum is "grossly exaggerated." There
also is a more modest estimate that her income is <MONEY>$35 million</MONEY> annually.;   
Over the years, researchers have tried to estimate the queen's personal
capital and income. Those assets are different from the institutions of the
monarchy, including the crown jewels in the Tower of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and the official
residences of <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Castle</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Windsor Castle</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Holyrood Castle.</ORGANIZATION>;    As
far as current official income goes, she receives from the British government
-- in what is called the Civil List -- 7.9 million pounds, or about <MONEY>$12.5
million</MONEY>. That sum is much more than her royal household expenses, giving her a
comfortable surplus this year. (Her employees, incidentally, pay taxes on
their salaries.);    But the queen has other major resources: Whatever money
she inherited from her father, <PERSON>King George VI</PERSON>; a vault full of precious jewels
-- crowns, tiaras, diamonds, rubies, emeralds; <ORGANIZATION>Faberge</ORGANIZATION> eggs; and the royal art
collection with 900 <PERSON>Leonardo Da Vinci</PERSON> drawings, 26 Van Dycks and works by
other masters. There is also one of the world's most valuable stamp
collections.;    Further, she owns hundreds of thousands of prime agricultural
acres, as well as valuable property in central <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. Then there are <LOCATION>Balmoral</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Sandringham</LOCATION> castles with 64,000 acres between them. Not to be forgotten
are the royal stud farms and stables.;    The queen's major source of income
may be her private investments, which have accrued tax-free over a long
period. In <DATE>1971</DATE>, to quiet speculation, the palace let it be known that her
investment portfolio in stock shares did not exceed 50 million pounds.;   
Taking an even lower figure of 35 million pounds, <PERSON>Andrew Morton</PERSON>, author of
"Theirs Is the Kingdom: The Wealth of the Windsors," consulted experts who
estimated that, if reasonably wisely invested, the portfolio would be worth
600 million pounds today. He estimates the queen's personal wealth at <MONEY>1.2
billion pounds</MONEY>.  </TEXT>

Harrods, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s luxury department store, today presented a new toothpaste for 
dogs that fights tooth decay and promises to give pets fresh breath. 
</P>
<P>
"<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> has nearly 7 million dogs, and their life expectancy is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
But often they have decaying teeth and gums, and their breath smells foul 
because they are fed on dog food that is soft," said <PERSON>Dr. Roger Mugford</PERSON>, an 
animal behaviorist. 
</P>
<P>
Mugford told reporters at the presentation of the new Petrodex toothpaste that 
he had tried the product out himself on a long-haired Irish setter and a 
short-legged Welsh corgi. "They loved the paste since it tastes malty," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But he conceded that he would not venture to try to brush just any dog's teeth, 
saying: "I would think about it with a Rottweiler" -- a breed known for its 
sharp teeth.

   Have you ever bought English tea thinking that the
royal seal on the package means Queen Elizabeth II drinks it?
   Brace yourself for a disappointment if you did. The warrant
doesn't guarantee that she does. Actually, <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> won't
say what Her Majesty prefers.
   ``Does that matter?'' asks <PERSON>Hugh Faulkner</PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION>Royal
Warrant Holders Association</ORGANIZATION>. ``The fact that she might not drink it
is irrelevant. That tea goes into <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION>.''
   Nevertheless, the Economist magazine wrote recently, ``Such
labels could mislead the unwary for two reasons'' _ a warrant
holder can display the royal insignia on goods other than just
those it supplies to a palace, and warrants also go to companies
supplying palace staff but not the royals themselves.
   Warrants are dispensed by the queen, the queen mother, <LOCATION>Prince
Philip</LOCATION> or Prince <PERSON>Charles</PERSON>. The warrants entitle holders to put a
royal coat of arms on labels, letterheads, trucks and buildings,
along with the words ``by appointment'' to whichever royal has
given the warrant.
   The wording changes with the monarch.
   Royal <LOCATION>Worcester</LOCATION>, the maker of fine china, got its warrant from
<ORGANIZATION>King George III</ORGANIZATION> 200 years ago, and today is ``by appointment to
Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth II</PERSON>.''
   Other countries' surviving monarchs also grant warrants, and in
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> the practice is centuries old.
   To win a warrant in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, a tradesman must have supplied the
royal household regularly for three years, and gotten paid by the
royal family for his goods or services, <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> says.
   Various holders have more than one warrant, but only about a
dozen elite, including Harrod's department store, hold all four.
   Others, like <ORGANIZATION>Royal Worcester</ORGANIZATION>, take pride in the length of their
service to the queen, who grants the most warrants of the four
entitled to.
   The queen's list is studded with luxury goods makers, including
12 jewelers and eight champagne sellers. There also are bagpipe
makers, military outfitters, suppliers of venison, chimney sweeps,
shipping agents, clock makers, porcelain restorers, purveyors of
potted shrimp and sloe gin, suppliers of gold and silver lace,
insignia and embroidery, and a heraldic artist.
   There's even a seller of mopeds on the list.
   More practical are suppliers who sell eggs and plastic bags and
``installers of intruder alarms,'' something all the more necessary
since <DATE>July 1982</DATE>, when a <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> eccentric broke into the queen's
bedroom and woke her up.
   The lists do keep up with the times. They contain, for example,
more computer equipment makers than in the past.
   About 10 to 40 warrants are granted a year. They cost nothing.
   A <ORGANIZATION>Royal Household Tradesmen's Warrants Committee</ORGANIZATION> decides once a
year who should get a warrant from the queen or her son and heir,
<PERSON>Prince Charles</PERSON>, subject to royal approval, and announce the results
in the <LOCATION>London Gazette</LOCATION>, the government bulletin. Queen Mother
<PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON> and Prince Philip consider applications throughout the
year.
   In olden times the granting of warrants was a more personal
affair. According to <LOCATION>Royal Worcester</LOCATION>, it got its warrant from
<PERSON>George III</PERSON> after he happened by the porcelain works and was
enchanted with the china.
   The products don't have to be British, but most are.
   ``There are very few outsiders,'' <PERSON>Faulkner</PERSON> said.
   British subsidiaries of foreign companies have won warrants,
including American ones, like <PERSON>Kellogg</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Heinz</PERSON>, and the makers
of <ORGANIZATION>Johnson</ORGANIZATION>'s wax.
   When companies lose their warrants _ because they aren't
measuring up, change hands, or the palace's needs have changed _
they are simply omitted from the published list.
   No official reason is given, and no figures are available
showing how many have been dropped.
   But, <PERSON>Faulkner</PERSON> said, ``people ... will notice.''
   Does a warrant help sales?
   ``Yes, it does,'' said a Royal Worcester spokesman.
   ``As you're aware, in this country the royal family is very
important. People do take note of it.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Cadbury Schweppes</ORGANIZATION> says it displays royal arms on chocolate bars
sold overseas.
   <PERSON>Faulkner</PERSON> said: ``Particularly in the Japanese market and
certainly in the American market, it doesn't hurt.''
   On the question of the queen's tea, <PERSON>Faulkner</PERSON> said: ``I wouldn't
make too much play of that particular angle. The lovely thing about
this is that people's imaginations can run wild. You don't want to
disappoint them.''
   Besides, he said, it's not something you'd bring up with the
queen.
   ``I think it would really be wrong, it would be bloody bad
manners to inquire ... what her personal likes and dislikes might
be.''

<HEAD>Queen Mother's Visit To London's East End Recalls Britain at War</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The woman who brought a queen's comfort to the
bomb-shattered East End during World War II returned to the rebuilt
district <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to celebrate <DATE>her 90th birthday</DATE>.
   Nearly 50 years after the German blitz, the presence of Queen
<PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON> the Queen Mother rekindled warm memories of a bitter time.
   During the war years, the then-Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON> picked her way
through the rubble in high heels and the pastel dresses she still
favors today, offering words of ecouragement to <LOCATION>East Enders</LOCATION>. They
still remember.
   ``She really did cheer us up. People were down in their depths
at the time,'' said <PERSON>Myrtle Lester</PERSON>, who as an 11-year-old spent long
hours in a damp backyard bomb shelter.
   The visit to the East End was a sentimental high point in four
months of parades and pageants leading up to the birthday on
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> of the ``Queen Mum,'' as she is fondly known.
   She arrived in the riverside district aboard the royal yacht
<ORGANIZATION>Britannia</ORGANIZATION>, wearing a light blue dress and matching hat with a wispy
veil, a string of pearls and a beaming smile.
   Elderly East <PERSON>Enders</PERSON> mingled with youngsters waving <ORGANIZATION>Union Jacks</ORGANIZATION>
who turned out to greet her. <PERSON>Alice Poyser</PERSON>, 69, said she remembered
well the wartime visits of the queen and <ORGANIZATION>King George VI</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We were pleased to see her. It felt like a mother talking to
us,'' she said. <PERSON>Mrs. Poyser</PERSON> said her family was bombed out of three
successive homes.
   Several people in the crowd recalled the queen's words after
<ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> was hit by a bomb: ``I'm glad we've been bombed.
It makes me feel I can look the East End in the face.''
   During the war, Prime Minister <PERSON>Winston Churchill</PERSON> advised her to
go to <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> for safety. She ignored him, and took lessons at
<ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> on how to use a rifle.
   Her daughters _ <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON>, now the queen, and Princess Margaret
_ stayed at <LOCATION>Windsor Castle</LOCATION>, 21 miles west of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, during the
conflict.
   The East End's shattered docks and factories have been replaced
by a huge redevelopment project that has brought new homes, shops
and offices.
   The Queen Mother unveiled a plaque honoring 76 people killed by
a bomb and revisited the shelters underneath All Saints' Church,
itself a bombing casualty in <DATE>1945</DATE>. She also saw some of those she
met during wartime.
   <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, she was to be guest of honor at a birthday
dinner on the Britannia given by the queen and <PERSON>Prince Philip</PERSON>,
followed by fireworks over the Tower of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
   The Queen Mother was born <DATE>Aug. 4, 1900</DATE>. Lady <PERSON>Elizabeth Angela
Marguerite Bowes-Lyon</PERSON> was the ninth child of the <LOCATION>Earl</LOCATION> and Countess
of <ORGANIZATION>Strathmore</ORGANIZATION>, whose family home was <ORGANIZATION>Glamis Castle</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>.
   In <DATE>1923</DATE> she married the <ORGANIZATION>Duke of York</ORGANIZATION>, second of four surviving
sons of King <PERSON>George V.</PERSON>
   She became queen, quite unexpectedly, when the duke's elder
brother, <LOCATION>Edward</LOCATION>, abdicated in <DATE>1936</DATE> to marry American divorcee
<PERSON>Wallis Warfield Simpson</PERSON>.
   Biographers say the Queen Mother never recovered from her
husband's early death from lung cancer in <DATE>1952</DATE>. She still refers to
him as ``the king'' and declines public appearances on the
anniversaries of his birth, marriage and death.
   Despite her age, the Queen Mother is still one of the most
active royals. Only the queen and Princess Anne make more public
appearances.

<TEXT>
From Leicester via a national tour and the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Court</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Sue Townsend</ORGANIZATION>'s
comedy has passed to the West End. As you must know, both the play and the
original 'novel' are about the present royal family, imagined as reduced by
a newly republican <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> to a grim council estate in <LOCATION>Leicester</LOCATION>. And why
not?
Ms <PERSON>Townsend</PERSON> chooses, however, not to explore many questions. I do not mean
that she ought to have explored any of them; only that her leaving them
untouched (why has the republic treated the royals so brutally? do they
learn anything significant in their exile? do their neighbours?) restricts
her play to a simple, homely vein in a never-never land.
The time of its notional future must be just weeks away, since the royals we
meet here have done nothing newly ridiculous since the ludicrous things we
think we know about already. Though there are mischievous little sallies
about those, none is followed up, and no character develops. For the guiding
premise is only this: wouldn't it be funny if the Queen and her clan were
stuck in a council estate?
Here I should declare a disability, from birth. All Brits, one gathers,
sometimes dream about meeting the Queen (often in unlikely circumstances,
but most often over tea) - even hard-Left Brits. That suggests that she
occupies a special place in your national dream-world, somewhere far beyond
ordinary assessment. When <ORGANIZATION>Ms Townsend</ORGANIZATION> brings her on to the stage in the
<LOCATION>Celia</LOCATION> Johnson-ish persona of <PERSON>Paula Wilcox</PERSON>, she comes ready-made as an icon;
you can then be titillated by hints of lese-majeste, and reminders of recent
'misconduct', and by the royals' supposed incomprehension of council-estate
demotic.
Those account for nearly all the comic substance of The Queen and I; those,
and a steady dribble of knowing references. For example, <PERSON>Prince Philip</PERSON>
insists on having his tea 'in my World Wildlife Fund mug]' Ha ha. Later the
Queen remarks that she has 'never met a butcher - except Bomber <PERSON>Harris</PERSON>, of
course.' Ha ha. But I liked the stuffed but lively corgi and the baby, both
in Spitting Image style.
Thanks to television, we expect stage-royal figures to be good
impersonators. Miss <PERSON>Wilcox</PERSON> makes a shy, engaging Queen, with glints of
something shyly aggressive. There is crepitating charm from <PERSON>Gillian Hanna</PERSON>'s
Queen Mum (and Crawfie); <PERSON>David Horovitch</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Philip</LOCATION> is a testy but kindly soul
out of sit-com, and <PERSON>Toby Salaman</PERSON>'s Charles a sympathetic, full-blooded
impersonation. Lizzy McInnerney's Di looks good, though the accent is more
striving-toward-Sloane-from-below than upper-class drooping Sloanewards;
<PERSON>Carole Hayman</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Margaret</PERSON> is a creature from <ORGANIZATION>Noel Coward</ORGANIZATION>'s stage milieu.
<PERSON>Pearce Quigley</PERSON> is outstandingly gormless as <PERSON>Prince William</PERSON>, two other chaps
and a <PERSON>Mrs Newman</PERSON>.
Their caricatured speech betrays scarcely any common ground, so we get no
sense of an aristocracy collectively at bay in an unfamiliar real world. In
<ORGANIZATION>Ms Townsend</ORGANIZATION>'s 'novels', there is something steady and unwinking behind their
cute prose surfaces. Here, that is dissipated among all the actors' turns
and the continual one-joke vignettes. But the amiability-factor is pretty
high; and if you can top it up with your own monarchical kink, you should
enjoy the show.

<HEAD>Government Acts to End Annual Row Over Royal Finances</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an attempt to end yearly budget-time rows over
the royal allowance, Prime Minister <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>
the royal family will receive a fixed annual increase for the next
decade.
   Such an arrangement was used for about 200 years before <DATE>1975</DATE>.
Then, the government began granting the royal allotment on an
annual basis as part of the national budget.
   The Civil List, as the payment is known, will rise at about <PERCENT>7.5
percent</PERCENT> per year for the next decade, <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> said.
   She said the royal family is ``a focus of patriotism, loyalty,
affection and esteem. It is a rare combination and we should value
it.''
   Behind her move was the wish to avoid the annual budget-day
``pay rise'' announcement, which both politicians and the royal
family found unseemly. Anti-monarchists used the budget
announcement as a chance to attack the expense of maintaining the
royals.
   Under the <DATE>1990</DATE> budget, the royal allowance totalled about <MONEY>$12.1
million</MONEY>. Queen Elizabeth II received the lion's share at <MONEY>$9.26
million</MONEY>.
   The Civil List officially repays the monarch and 10 other
members of her family for official duties. About <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of the
money goes to salaries and employment costs for royal staff.
   The queen has 250 permanent full-time employees, including those
in her private office, the <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> press office staff and
those responsible for ceremonial duties.
   Prince <PERSON>Charles</PERSON>, the heir to the throne, is not on the Civil
List. He receives undisclosed income from royal estates.
   <ORGANIZATION>Opposition Labor Party</ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON>Neil Kinnock</PERSON> applauded the new
arrangement and said it would ``provide for greater continuity and
more effective planning in the financing of the royal household.''
   Meanwhile, the queen has recruited a leading <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> accountant
to help run her households more efficiently.
   <PERSON>Michael Peat</PERSON>, 40, a partner in the accounting firm of <ORGANIZATION>Peat
Marwick McLintock</ORGANIZATION>, was named the royal household's director of
finance and property services. He will oversee the management of
<ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Windsor Castle</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>St. James Palace</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Kensington
Palace</ORGANIZATION>.

to divorce Capt. <PERSON>Mark Phillips</PERSON>.
   ``Divorce? It's not been mentioned,'' <PERSON>Queen Elizabeth II</PERSON>'s only

   <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> refused to comment on the <DATE>Monday</DATE> reports in

   Anne, 39, and <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON>, 41, separated <DATE>last August</DATE> after 15 years
of marriage. They have two children.
   A spokesman at <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION>, who was not identified in
keeping with British custom, said: ``I have nothing to add to what
was said at the time of the separation.''
   The palace issued a statement on <DATE>Aug. 31</DATE> that said: ``Her Royal
Highness, the Princess Royal, and Captain <PERSON>Mark Phillips</PERSON> have
decided to separate on terms agreed between them. There are no
plans for divorce proceedings.''
   At the time, royal sources said the queen was ``obviously
saddened'' but understood the couple's decision.

   The new baby, daughter of the queen's second son, is sixth in

breech position, a <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. ``It was the
wrong way round,'' he said.
   The duchess, the former <PERSON>Sarah Ferguson</PERSON>, had spent the last week
at <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> instead of her country home. She
arrived at the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> hospital nearly four hours earlier in a
chauffeur-driven car and entered through a side entrance, avoiding
photographers waiting at the front.
   Her husband joined her <DATE>two hours later</DATE> after driving the 150
miles from <LOCATION>Devonport</LOCATION> naval dockyard, where he is based as a flight
commander on the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Navy</ORGANIZATION> frigate <LOCATION>Campbeltown</LOCATION>.
   As tradition dictates, a notice was posted on the railings at
<ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> giving news of the birth.
   It read: ``Her Royal Highness the Duchess of <LOCATION>York</LOCATION> was safely
delivered of a daughter at <TIME>7:58 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>today</DATE>. Her Royal Highness and
her child are well.''
   The birth was greeted by cheering and the cracking of champagne
corks by a small crowd of well-wishers outside the hospital.
   The Duchess of <LOCATION>York</LOCATION>'s father, Maj. <PERSON>Ronald Ferguson</PERSON>, said at his
home at <LOCATION>Dummer</LOCATION>, a village 53 miles southwest of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>: ``I am
delighted for the mother and daughter.''
   For <PERSON>Beatrice</PERSON>'s birth, the duchess was admitted shortly after <TIME>10
a.m.</TIME> and gave birth at <TIME>8:18 p.m.</TIME>
   No name was announced immediately for the new baby, but she will
be known as <ORGANIZATION>Her Royal Highness</ORGANIZATION>, Princess (baby's name) of <LOCATION>York</LOCATION>.
   Andrew's elder brother <PERSON>Prince Charles</PERSON>, 41, is first in line to
the throne, followed by his sons <PERSON>Prince William and Prince Harry</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION>. Then comes <PERSON>Andrew</PERSON>, 30, then <PERSON>Beatrice</PERSON>.
   The queen's unmarried youngest son, <PERSON>Edward</PERSON>, 26, is now seventh
in line of succession. Her 39-year-old daughter <PERSON>Anne</PERSON>, the Princess
Royal, is eighth and has a son and daughter, <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> and <PERSON>Zara</PERSON>, who
are ninth and tenth.
   The duke's ship has returned to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> after exercises and is
to remain in home waters until <DATE>July</DATE>. The queen went to <LOCATION>Windsor
Castle</LOCATION>, 21 miles west of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, for the <DATE>weekend</DATE> and has been
notified of the birth.

   Fresh from the splendors of the <ORGANIZATION>Kremlin</ORGANIZATION>, President
<PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> and his wife <PERSON>Nancy</PERSON> went to <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> for tea with
the queen <DATE>Thursday</DATE> and smiled aside all invitations to compare the
virtues of East and <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>.
   Standing on a red carpet in the marble-columned Grand Entrance
<PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of the 600-room palace, the president was asked by a reporter
whether he was happy to be out of <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> and back in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
   ``Let me put it very simply, I'm very happy to be in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>,''
he replied, smiling wryly.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Reagan</PERSON>, whose prickly relationship with <PERSON>Raisa Gorbachev</PERSON> was
evident during this week's <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> summit, was asked whether she was
happy to be seeing Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth II</PERSON> rather than the Soviet
leader's wife.
   ``I'm very happy to see the queen at all times,'' she replied
with a big smile.
   The hour-long tea in the queen's Audience Room overlooking the
45-acre palace gardens was a meeting of old friends. The Reagans
were guests of the royal family at <ORGANIZATION>Windsor Castle</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1982</DATE>, and the
62-year-old monarch stayed at the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> ranch in <DATE>1983</DATE>. <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>
attended a <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> dinner during the <DATE>1984</DATE> economic summit.
   The Reagans arrived at the palace two minutes late, getting out
of their limousine at the glassed-in <LOCATION>Grand Entrance</LOCATION>, where Prince
<PERSON>Charles</PERSON> and Princess Diana returned in a horse-drawn open carriage
after their <DATE>1981</DATE> wedding extravaganza.
   Inside the hall, the queen, hatless and wearing a sapphire-blue
silk dress, stretched out her hand and said: ``Nice to see you
again. How are you Mr. President?''
   <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>, in a blue suit and red and blue striped tie, and the
first lady, wearing a silk two-piece dress and matching shoes in
her favorite color of red, chatted with the queen while posing for
photographers.
   Then, the queen led them along the gilt-and-white <ORGANIZATION>Marble Hall</ORGANIZATION>,
lined with sculptures and paintings mainly of her great-great
grandmother Queen <PERSON>Victoria</PERSON>, to the Audience Room, where she
receives Prime Minister <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON> for her weekly audience.
   It was just tea for three, since the queen's husband, <PERSON>Prince
Philip</PERSON>, had a previous engagement in <LOCATION>Suffolk</LOCATION>.
   The Reagans' greeting was watched by about 50 members of the
queen's household who stood behind a red rope in the <ORGANIZATION>Marble Hall</ORGANIZATION>.
   Outside the palace, police said about 1,500 people gathered,
cheering and waving as the Reagans drove by. The president and his
wife waved back as they swept through the iron gates.
   ``We got a beautiful warm smile. It was worth the 2{-hour
wait,'' said <PERSON>Barbara Lee</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Barbara Black</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Camarillo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, said: ``I live ... about
30 miles from <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s ranch, and I don't bother to visit him, and
here I am half way around the world standing in line waiting to get
a vague glimpse of him.''
   <PERSON>Justine Griffin</PERSON>, a Scot who waited outside the palace, also was
enthusiastic about the American president.
   ``I think he's a good bloke,'' she said.
   After tea, the Reagans went their separate ways.
   The president went to the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Office</ORGANIZATION> where he was officially
welcomed by <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> and a band of <ORGANIZATION>Welsh Guards</ORGANIZATION> playing the
national anthem and <PERSON>Irving Berlin</PERSON> hits.
   The first lady returned to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ambassador's residence,
<ORGANIZATION>Winfield House</ORGANIZATION>, to meet with <PERSON>Prince Charles</PERSON>, who flew back to
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> from a series of public engagements in <LOCATION>Lancashire</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Reagan</PERSON> and the 39-year-old heir to the throne have met
several times previously in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, and the palace
said they share an interest in social and human rights issues.

Still on the subject of presents, the lull in new product launches in
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s royal memorabilia market seems to have ended. One company, no
doubt staffed by republicans, has produced a 'Windsor in Flames'
commemorative mug. On one side is a picture of a burning <LOCATION>Windsor</LOCATION> castle,
while the other has a cartoon of a monarch, plus corgis, living in a
cardboard box on the Embankment and saying 'Can you spare us Pounds 60m,
guv?'
Rather surprisingly, the Guardian carried the advert but Time Out, the
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> listings magazine, rejected it. Bet that wouldn't have happened when
it was being run by the previous bunch of lefties.

TRANSIT OF VENUS: TRAVELS IN THESOUTH PACIFIC by <ORGANIZATION>Julian Evans Secker &amp;
Warburg Pounds</ORGANIZATION> 16.99, 277 pages
PILGRIM OF THE VOID by <PERSON>Kenneth White Mainstream</PERSON> Pounds 14.99, 254 pages
PRE-publication hype is getting more and more serious. Nowadays, books have
to be garlanded with pre-pub quotes. You know the sort: 'The best book on
Corgi breeding I have ever read' - <PERSON>Queen Elizabeth II</PERSON>; 'A wonderful
introduction to developing your personality. Invaluable bedtime reading' -
<PERSON>John Major</PERSON>.
The pre-pub quote that accompanies <ORGANIZATION>Transit of Venus</ORGANIZATION> is from <PERSON>Norman Lewis</PERSON>, no
less. Lewis is in the premier division of travel writers. '<ORGANIZATION>Transit of Venus</ORGANIZATION>
is the best book about the South Seas I have ever read. <PERSON>Julian Evans</PERSON> is the
<PERSON>Robert Louis Stevenson</PERSON> of the post-nuclear <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>,' he says.
Post-nuclear Pacific? <PERSON>Robert Louis Stevenson</PERSON>? Mid-way through the book, I
thought that <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> had flipped; by the end, I was happily changing my mind,
for <PERSON>Julian Evans</PERSON> builds his story well and is a meticulous, vivid writer -
reminiscent of <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> himself.
Evans starts in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>. He goes to <LOCATION>New Caledonia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fiji</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Samoa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tonga</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Tuvalu</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kiribati</LOCATION> and finally the <LOCATION>Marshall Islands</LOCATION>, including the military
base at <LOCATION>Kwajalein</LOCATION> and the island ghetto of <LOCATION>Kili</LOCATION>. By the time he reaches the
Marshalls he is close to despair, and little wonder. In the Marshalls,
everyone sleeps with everyone, gets syphilis, gets treated, sleeps with
everyone else again.
The Marshallese, says <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, do not see the point of contraception, so the
president had imported 15m tonnes of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s domestic garbage to create
lagoon landfills - 'a brilliantly simple scheme in which the government
would be paid Dollars 140m by grateful waste disposal companies and
potentially end up doubling the land area of <LOCATION>Majuro</LOCATION> island . . . in 10 years
time he would be able to say he was president of the biggest garbage dump in
the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>.' This is a bleak book. <PERSON>Robert Louis Stevenson</PERSON> or not, <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> is
honest and shrewd: a first-rate reporter.
Pilgrim of the Void is not an easy read, but perhaps the fault is mine.
<PERSON>Kenneth White</PERSON>, says his publisher, was born in <LOCATION>Glasgow</LOCATION>, settled in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in
<DATE>1967</DATE> and holds the chair of <DATE>20th century</DATE> poetics at the <LOCATION>Sorbonne</LOCATION>. He has won
prizes, and is an expert on post-modernity, but can't be all bad.
Pilgrim of the Void starts in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>, moves to <LOCATION>Macao</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>, then
<LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. Here is a typical passage (the author is taking a train
from <LOCATION>Kowloon</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Shatin</LOCATION>, to visit the 10,000 <ORGANIZATION>Buddha Temples</ORGANIZATION>): 'There was a
little beauty in the carriage, one of these beauties that grace <LOCATION>South China</LOCATION>,
only 16 years old, the kind of girl described in the beautiful Cantonese
phrase ham bao doi fong (flower blossom waiting open). Ah yes, lovely,
perfect loveliness - ni ho lei, little girl, ni ho lei, ni ho lei], shall I
say it a hundred times under my breath, like a prayer?' Either this is a
reasonably good travel book, or else a load of tosh. I expect I read it too
quickly. I will now read it slowly.

<HEAD>Queen Elizabeth Gives Preview of Christmas Message</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth II</PERSON>, in a preview of her annual
Christmas message, spoke optimistically of <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Western
Europe</LOCATION> living as neighbors and an unselfish world uniting to save
the planet.
   The queen broke the tradition of keeping her message secret
until <DATE>Christmas</DATE> day and delivered part of it to an audience of
6,000 at <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Royal Albert Hall</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> confirmed <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that sections of her
speech would be included in her Christmas message to the 49-nation
<ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth of Britain</ORGANIZATION> and its former colonies.
   The monarch, speaking on the ``exciting'' political and social
changes in recent months, said people in both <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Western
Europe</LOCATION> have been able to think about themselves more as neighbors.
And the key to the future was learning to ``love thy neighbor as
thyself,'' she said.
   The possibility that <ORGANIZATION>Christ</ORGANIZATION>'s message might at last be heeded
could make the <DATE>1990s</DATE> a time for peace and cooperation to preserve
the planet from environmental threats, she said.
   ``If we can reduce dishonesty, selfishness and injustice, the
'90s might become years of peace and tranquillity, and a time to
work together for the benefit of our planet as a whole,'' the queen
said.
   ``We must be kind to it for the sake of our children and our
children's children,'' she said.
   The queen was attending a Christmas fund-raising gala for the
Save The Children charity, headed by her daughter, <PERSON>Princess Anne</PERSON>.
   ``I usually make my Christmas broadcast to the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION> from
<LOCATION>Windsor</LOCATION> or <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. ``This year I thought I
would use the presence of 2,000 children in the <PERSON>Royal Albert Hall</PERSON>
to send this special message to the children of the Commonwealth.''
   Among the children at the gala, where a cast of 700 told the
story of the Bible from creation to the birth of <LOCATION>Christ</LOCATION>, were two
of the queen's grandsons: <PERSON>Peter Philips</PERSON>, 12, who is <PERSON>Anne</PERSON>'s son, and
<PERSON>Prince William</PERSON>, 7, son of Prince <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Princess Diana</ORGANIZATION>.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Princess <PERSON>Beatrice</PERSON> was bapitized <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by the
archbishop of <LOCATION>York</LOCATION> with water from the <LOCATION>Jordan River</LOCATION>, and she let out
just one quick cry as her parents, the <ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Duchess of York</ORGANIZATION>,
watched in delight.
   The 19-week-old princess, the newest member of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s royal
family, got a calming pat on the back from her mother after the
archbishop poured the water on her forehead in a ceremony that made
her a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Church of England</ORGANIZATION>.
   Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth II</PERSON>, the baby's grandmother who is temporal head
of the Anglican church, smiled broadly as she led the baby and about
100 relatives and friends out of the <ORGANIZATION>Chapel Royal</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>St. James'
Palace</ORGANIZATION> after the christening to pose briefly for photographers.
   The blue-eyed princess, who has her mother's red hair, looked
directly into the cameras. She didn't let out a peep as she rested
in the arms of the duchess, who wore an emerald green suit and
matching hat with a wide upturned brim and black band.
   Princess <PERSON>Beatrice Elizabeth Mary</PERSON>, fifth in line to the throne and
the queen's fifth grandchild, was born on <DATE>Aug. 8, 1988</DATE>, at <TIME>8:18
p.m.</TIME>, considered to be lucky by Chinese astrologers.
   Poet Laureate <PERSON>Ted Hughes</PERSON> wrote what he called a nursey-rhyme hymn
woven around the six eights in her birth. It notes that the
``blessed and fortunate'' child comes into a world of ``poisoned
glut'' and ``poisoned seas.''
   The princess' baptism was delayed until after her father, <PERSON>Prince
Andrew</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Royal Navy</ORGANIZATION> lieutenant, returned last week from a tour of
duty in the <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> said the duke and duchess chose the Most Rev.
<PERSON>John Habgood</PERSON>, Archbishop of <LOCATION>York</LOCATION> and second-ranking prelate in the
church rather than <ORGANIZATION>Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie</ORGANIZATION>, the
church's spiritual leader, to christen their daughter because of
``personal and appropriate'' reasons _ a reference to their York
title.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Chapel Royal</ORGANIZATION>, the main surviving part of the <ORGANIZATION>Tudor Palace</ORGANIZATION>
built by <PERSON>Henry VIII</PERSON>, was also chosen by the couple, the palace said.
Queen <PERSON>Victoria</PERSON> and <PERSON>Prince Albert</PERSON> were married in the chapel in <DATE>1840</DATE>
and royal christenings occasionally have taken place there.
   The 30-minute private ceremony included three hymns chosen by the
parents, ``Jesus, Good Above All Other,'' ``All Things Bright and
Beautiful,'' and a Christmas touch, ``Away In A Manger.''
   The choir also sang ``Princess <PERSON>Beatrice</PERSON>'s Anthem,'' composed by
<PERSON>Richard Popplewell</PERSON>, organist and choir master of the queen's Chapels
Royal, with words by the late <PERSON>Lord Gorell</PERSON>, a literary magazine
editor.
   Beatrice was dressed in the royal family's christening robe of
flowing cream Honiton lace, first worn by Queen <PERSON>Victoria</PERSON>'s eldest
son in <DATE>1842</DATE>.
   She was baptized at the silver gilt <PERSON>Lily Font</PERSON>, made for the
christening in <DATE>1840</DATE> of <LOCATION>Princess Victoria</LOCATION>, Queen <PERSON>Victoria</PERSON>'s eldest
child, and used to baptize Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON>'s four children.
   Like all godparents at Anglican baptisms, <PERSON>Beatrice</PERSON>'s five were
reminded of their duty to raise the princess to fight against evil
and to follow Christ.
   Her godparents are <PERSON>Viscount Linley</PERSON>, son of the queen's sister
Princess <PERSON>Margaret</PERSON>; property developer <PERSON>Peter Palumbo</PERSON>, who is chairman
of the Arts Council; <PERSON>Mrs. Harry Cotterell</PERSON>, who formerly shared an
apartment with the duchess; the Duchess of Roxburghe, at whose
Scottish home the duke proposed to the then-Sarah <PERSON>Ferguson</PERSON>; and <PERSON>Mrs.
John Greenall</PERSON>, a friend of the duchess.
   Among the guests at the christening were the queen's eldest son
and heir to the throne, <PERSON>Prince Charles</PERSON>, his wife, Princess <PERSON>Diana</PERSON> and
their two children, <PERSON>Prince William</PERSON>, 6, and <LOCATION>Prince Harry</LOCATION>, 4. Queen
Mother <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON>, the baby's 88-year-old great-grandmother, was also
there.
   After the ceremony, the guests went to <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> for a
tea party in the white and gold decorated Bow Room overlooking the
palace gardens. The duke, an accomplished amateur photographer, took
the official family photographs of the christening party.

   Because of the large number of guests, the palace picture
gallery with its valuable collection of Old Master paintings was

   Royal aide <PERSON>Timothy Laurence</PERSON>, whose letters to
Princess <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> have renewed speculation her marriage is in trouble,
was dropped from <PERSON>Queen Elizabeth II</PERSON>'s entourage at the public
premiere of a new <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> musical.
   But <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> stressed in a statement that <PERSON>Laurence</PERSON> had
remained on duty back at <LOCATION>Windsor Castle</LOCATION>, 21 miles west of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
   The bachelor, a <ORGANIZATION>Royal Navy</ORGANIZATION> commander, had been scheduled to
accompany the queen, <PERSON>Anne</PERSON>'s mother, to a charity performance <DATE>Monday</DATE>
<TIME>night</TIME> of composer <PERSON>Andrew Lloyd Webber</PERSON>'s new show, ``Aspects of
Love,'' in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s West End.
   As <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION> Yard investigated the theft of four of <PERSON>Laurence</PERSON>'s
letters to <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> from the palace, speculation about her 15-year
marriage to <PERSON>Mark Phillips</PERSON> made front-page news again today in
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s royal-mad tabloids.
   Phillips, a farmer and equestrian, is a former captain in The
Queen's <ORGANIZATION>Dragoon Guards</ORGANIZATION>. Rumors his marriage to <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> is in trouble
have circulated for years and recently the two have spent up to six
months a year apart.
   They have two children, <PERSON>Peter</PERSON>, 11, and <PERSON>Zara</PERSON>, 7.
   ``Dashing queen's equerry (aide) <PERSON>Tim Laurence</PERSON> is `besotted' with
Princess <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> and believes she loves him too,'' The Sun, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s
largest circulation newspaper, reported today, quoting unnamed
friends of <PERSON>Laurence</PERSON>.
   ``The handsome 34-year-old Naval Commander often speaks to her
on the phone late at night, sometimes for more than an hour. And he
meets her secretly whenever possible in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> or at country
homes.''
   Anne's father-in-law, Maj. <PERSON>Peter Phillips</PERSON>, denied <DATE>Monday</DATE> that
the marriage was on the rocks, and said he spoke to his son as
recently as <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   ``He would confide in me if there was anything wrong but all the
conversation was about horses,'' <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> said.
   ``It's not the sort of marriage that ordinary people would
understand at all _ they spend so much time away from one another.
   ``If people are royal, they don't necessarily spend lots of time
together ... Of course their marriage is very unusual.''
   The British domestic news agency <ORGANIZATION>Press Association</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Anne</PERSON>,
38, and her 40-year-old husband were reunited for six hours
overnight at their country mansion, <LOCATION>Gatcombe Park</LOCATION>, 90 miles west of
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, after she spent a busy day fulfilling engagements in
<LOCATION>northwest England</LOCATION>.
   The news agency said <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> arrived home after <TIME>midnight</TIME> but left
about <TIME>6 a.m.</TIME> to go horseback riding. When she returned three hours
later to prepare for engagements in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> had left the
house. His business agent, <PERSON>Taryn Bennelick</PERSON>, said <DATE>today</DATE> he was
somewhere in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> but gave no details.
   Anne has become the busiest and one of the most admired member
of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s royal family. As president of the Save the Children
Fund charity, she travels on behalf of children in poverty-stricken
and war-torn Third World countries. Phillips also travels widely on
various business and equestrian interests.
   The latest speculation about the couple's marriage began after
The Sun reported <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that it had been sent anonymously four
letters stolen from <PERSON>Anne</PERSON>'s desk at <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION>.
   The Sun pledged not to publish the contents and said it had
turned them over to <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION> Yard.
   After a <DATE>Sunday</DATE> newspaper told <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> it was going to
name the author, the palace identified <PERSON>Laurence</PERSON>.
   Royalty correspondent <PERSON>Richard Kay</PERSON> wrote today in The Daily Mail
``Anne and Mark no longer have a marriage in the conventional
sense.''
   But <PERSON>Kay</PERSON> predicted: ``There won't be any announcement of a
divorce ... For it is she... who has brought back much

From the fog of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> to the glitter of Hollywood to the sands of the <LOCATION>Sahara</LOCATION>, 
there are no boundaries for Sissy Harrington-McGill and her holistic pet food. 
Whether it's royalty's horses, a celebrity's chow chow or a sheik's camel, when 
pampered pets get hungry, their concerned owners look to <LOCATION>El Cajon</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
What started out as a small dog food business in <DATE>1974</DATE> out of 
Harrington-McGill's La <LOCATION>Mesa</LOCATION> home has now turned into a multipurpose pet product 
center -- Solid Gold Animal Nutrition Center at <DATE>1483</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Cuyamaca St.</ORGANIZATION> 
</P>
<P>
So what makes the Queen of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and so many other celebrities go for the 
Gold? The answer is in the food's ingredients, some of which are said to be 
unique to the pet world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stumbled Upon Business 
</P>
<P>
According to Harrington-McGill, her introduction to the pet products field came 
by accident while searching overseas for <ORGANIZATION>Great Danes</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I bred <PERSON>Great Danes</PERSON> as a hobby," <PERSON>Harrington-McGill</PERSON> said. "After losing three of 
them to bloat, I decided to go to <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> to buy another. I visited 44 kennels 
until I found the dog I was looking for. In fact, I bought two of them." 
</P>
<P>
While there, she asked the owner of the kennel, <PERSON>Baron Hans-Georg von Maischack</PERSON>, 
if he knew what caused bloat. To her surprise, he said he had never heard of 
the canine ailment because it doesn't exist in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Bloat, according to <PERSON>Dean Gahring</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>San Diego County Veterinary 
Assn.</ORGANIZATION>, kills about 500 dogs a week in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. The specific cause is 
unknown, he said, but it's mainly because of gastric torsion -- where the 
stomach twists from 90 to 100 degrees or more, causing the juncture between the 
stomach and the esophagus, and the stomach and small intestines to close. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe he had never heard of it." Harrington-McGill said. "There 
wasn't even a word for it. This baffled both me and the kennel owner, so we 
began to explore the cause of bloat." 
</P>
<P>
After the two talked, they discovered that dogs in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United 
States</LOCATION> have different diets. German dog food contains mainly fish and no animal 
fat, preservatives or soybeans. In the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, some of the main 
ingredients are chicken, animal fat, sugar and soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
Her conviction that bloat stemmed from dietary differences led 
Harrington-McGill to purchase a recipe <PERSON>Von Maischack</PERSON> had developed over the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"Since Great <PERSON>Danes</PERSON> were originally from <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, it made sense to me that they 
should eat the food they had eaten for generations," she said. "I wasn't sure 
if diet was the main cause for the ailment, but it sounded like the most 
logical one." 
</P>
<P>
After buying two <PERSON>Great Danes</PERSON>, and with her new dog food recipe in hand, she 
returned to this country. For several months after that, she crisscrossed the 
states in search of a mill that would put together her formula. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really hard to get anybody interested in making this formula," she 
said. "It wasn't the ingredients, it was the quantity and type of kibble I 
wanted. I just wanted it for my dogs, so I only needed a little, but most 
manufacturers said they didn't work with small amounts." 
</P>
<P>
Harrington-McGill said she decided to "play it their way," and, after finding a 
receptive mill in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, she placed a 10-ton order for small-pellet, 
hard-baked kibbles. 
</P>
<P>
Pleased with the outcome, she said she continued feeding her dogs the kibble 
and noticed how well they responded to it. Apparently, she wasn't the only one 
to notice. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was showing my <PERSON>Great Danes</PERSON> at dog shows, people would comment on their 
gleaming coats and asked what I was feeding them," she said. "That's the first 
thing people ask when they see a dog in good condition." 
</P>
<P>
After a couple of months, she had several people asking her if she could "throw 
in an extra bag of kibble" when ordering her dogs' food from the mill. 
</P>
<P>
"In the begining, I had extra bags so I gave some to my friends," said 
<PERSON>Harrington-McGill</PERSON>, who was working then as an elementary school teacher. "But, 
after a while, I had to put in larger orders to accommodate everyone." 
</P>
<P>
By the <DATE>end of 1974</DATE>, she was ordering 4 to 5 tons of kibble monthly. Realizing 
that there were tantalizing business possibilities, she decided to test her 
dog-food formula to see what form was most marketable. 
</P>
<P>
During those experiments, she said, she found that the hard-baked kibble sold 
best. 
</P>
<P>
"It was such a new concept, no one in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> had anything like it," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
By <DATE>1978</DATE>, when <PERSON>Harrington-McGill</PERSON>'s monthly manufacturing total had reached 7 
tons, she resigned from her teaching position to give full-time attention to 
her dog-food venture. She also began selling food products for cats, horses and 
other animals. 
</P>
<P>
"You are what you eat, and that goes for animals, too," she said. "Most people 
really care about their animals, so why not give them the best?" 
</P>
<P>
Harrington-McGill started a mail-order business and offered products such as 
Seal Meal, <PERSON>Herbal Wormer</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Natural Flea Powder and Natural Flee Shampoo</ORGANIZATION>. 
Initially, she ran the business out of her home and a rented warehouse, but in 
<DATE>1984</DATE> she moved to her present location in <LOCATION>El Cajon</LOCATION>, where, in addition to the 
food, she also sells a animal accessories. 
</P>
<P>
As business grew, so did her marketing strategies. While attending a trade show 
in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, she said she sneaked through an unopen gate in the back of 
<ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> in an attempt to give her products to <ORGANIZATION>Queen Elizabeth II</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe I got in there," she said. "But, as soon as I was in, a 
guard caught me and asked me what I wanted. I quickly showed him two of my 
products and asked him if he could give the samples to Her Majesty." 
</P>
<P>
Although the guard assured her that he would do so, Harrington-McGill left 
assuming that he would simply discard her samples after she was gone. Three 
weeks later, however, she was shocked when she received a <MONEY>$1,700</MONEY> telephone 
order from <LOCATION>Buckingham Palace</LOCATION> for a product called Solid Gold Golden Edge, which 
contains natural herbs believed to induce calm in animals. 
</P>
<P>
Through word of mouth, her products soon came to the attention of other royalty 
and celebrities. Shortly after the queen's order was placed, she received a 
call from a man she described as an Arab sheik asking for <MONEY>$2,200</MONEY> worth of her 
products. Over the years, her client list grew to include such notables as 
<PERSON>Frank Sinatra</PERSON>, <PERSON>Zsa Zsa Gabor</PERSON>, <PERSON>William Shatner</PERSON>, <PERSON>Stephanie Powers</PERSON> and director 
<PERSON>John Frankenheimer</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Most of her clients, however, are everyday people with the same goal in mind 
that she had at the outset: finding healthy food for their pets. Today, about 
<PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> of her business is conducted by mail order. The rest of her sales occur at 
her <ORGANIZATION>El Cajon</ORGANIZATION> store and other outlets throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Solid Gold is the stuff of a health-minded dog owner's dream or just 
one more entrepreneurial spin in in the crowded animal products market is hard 
to say now. Dean <PERSON>Gahring</PERSON> said he wouldn't rule it out that Solid Gold is all 
Harrington-McGill says it is, but there no studies have been done to confirm 
it. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, business has been so good, <PERSON>Harrington-McGill</PERSON> said she hasn't 
had time to think about it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all happened so rapidly, I'm too busy to be surprised," she said. "I just 
keep working at it."

<HEAD>A Princess's Wonderful Day at Coronation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Papa looked very beautiful in his crimson robe,
but there was a terrible draft in <LOCATION>Westminster Abbey</LOCATION>, wrote the
little princess after her parents' coronation in <DATE>1937</DATE>.
   The childhood essay of Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth II</PERSON> gets its first public
showing beginning <DATE>Friday</DATE> in the <LOCATION>Queen</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Gallery</LOCATION>, where royal
treasures are displayed at <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION>.
   It's part of 271 exhibits called ``A Royal Miscellany'' showing
through <DATE>Jan. 13, 1991</DATE>.
   The exhibition includes everything from clocks and jewelry to
the embroidered linen overshirt worn by King Charles I as he knelt
to the headsman's ax in <DATE>1649</DATE>.
   Visitors can view a lock of French Emperor <PERSON>Napoleon Bonaparte</PERSON>'s
hair, a watercolor of <LOCATION>Balmoral</LOCATION> royal estate by <PERSON>Prince Charles</PERSON>, and
a copy of the <LOCATION>Mainz</LOCATION> Psalter _ a <DATE>1457</DATE> German collection of prayers
that was the first book printed in more than one color.
   Among the displays are the neat, proper letters of the
11-year-old princess <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON>. They are written in a lined
exercise book that would have cost tuppence, <MONEY>four cents</MONEY> at that
time.
   ``I thought it all very, very wonderful and I expect the <ORGANIZATION>Abbey</ORGANIZATION>
did, too. The arches and beams at the top were covered with a sort
of haze of wonder as <LOCATION>Papa</LOCATION> was crowned, at least I thought so,''
wrote the princess.
   Elizabeth, her sister Princess <PERSON>Margaret</PERSON> and their widowed
grandmother Queen <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> had a grandstand view of the ceremony from a
royal box in the abbey, where <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON> herself would be crowned in
<DATE>1953</DATE>.
   ``What struck me as being rather odd was that <PERSON>Grannie</PERSON> did not
remember much of her own coronation. I should have thought that it
would have stayed in her mind forever,'' Princess <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON> wrote.
   However, toward the end, the child found the service becoming
``rather boring'' as it was all prayers.
   ``Grannie and I were looking to see how many more pages to the
end, and we turned one more and then I pointed to the word at the
bottom of the page and it said `Finis.' We both smiled at each
other and turned back to the service,'' she wrote.
   ``The princess was probably asked by her tutor to record her
impressions of the coronation,'' said <PERSON>Oliver Everett</PERSON>, director of
the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Library</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Windsor Castle</ORGANIZATION>, the favorite royal residence
21 miles west of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
   Everett, a former diplomat, selected the essay and 270 other
items for the exhibition.
   ``The library is closed to the public, but the queen takes her
guests there. As the castle is being rewired and repaired, guests
cannot be shown round so we took the opportunity to send some
interesting things to the gallery,'' <PERSON>Everett</PERSON> said in an interview
at <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s preview.
   Even the prophetic thoughts of <ORGANIZATION>King George III</ORGANIZATION> after the British
defeat by the American colonists in <DATE>1781</DATE> are displayed: ``<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>
is lost! Must we fall beneath this blow?'' he wrote.
   But he was consoled by the thought that ``it is to be hoped we
shall reap more advantages from their trade as friends than ever we
could derive from them as Colonies.''

<HEAD>Trooping the Color: Queen Honored On Official Birthday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cavalrymen and foot soldiers in scarlet tunics and
bearskin hats paraded in the center of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> <DATE>Saturday</DATE> to honor
<PERSON>Queen Elizabeth II</PERSON> with the Trooping the Color on her ``official''
birthday.
   The queen, who is 62, celebrated her real birthday on <DATE>April 21</DATE>,
but the official birthday ceremonies are held on the <DATE>second
Saturday of June</DATE> when the weather normally is better. The sky was
overcast and there was a damp chill in the air <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   This year, for the first time since <DATE>1973</DATE>, the 1,588 men of all
five regiments of the <ORGANIZATION>Brigade of Guards</ORGANIZATION> joined the parade because
all are currently based in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
   The guards _ <ORGANIZATION>Grenadier</ORGANIZATION>, Coldstream, <LOCATION>Scots</LOCATION>, Irish and Welsh
regiments _ are often scattered, seeing service in such places as
<LOCATION>Northern Ireland</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Falkland Islands</LOCATION>.
   Four generations of the royal family joined the ceremony this
year, riding in coaches or on horseback to the Horse Guards Parade,
an open square in <ORGANIZATION>Whitehall</ORGANIZATION>, where the queen inspected the Irish
Guards while massed bands played.
   Each year one regiment performs the honors, marching in
intricate patterns and carrying the ``color,'' or regimental
standard.
   Elizabeth, wearing a blue coat and wide-brimmed hat, arrived in
a horse-drawn phaeton and took the salute standing on a dais. It
was the second year she had used the carriage since retiring her
horse, Burmese, which she used to ride sidesaddle for the occasion,
wearing a scarlet uniform.
   The queen's 5-year-old grandson, <PERSON>Prince William</PERSON>, was with his
mother, the <PERSON>Princess Diana</PERSON>, and his great-grandmother, Queen Mother
<PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON>, in her carriage.
   Riding horseback was the heir to the throne, <PERSON>Prince Charles</PERSON> in
his uniform as colonel of the <ORGANIZATION>Welsh Guards</ORGANIZATION>, along with the queen's
husband, <PERSON>Prince Philip</PERSON>, a colonel of the <ORGANIZATION>Grenadier Guards</ORGANIZATION>.
   On her return to <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION>, the queen appeared on a
balcony to wave to her subjects and thousands of tourists.
   <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s pageantry was based on the ceremony used for guard
mounting in the <DATE>18th century</DATE> and was first performed on the
sovereign's birthday for <ORGANIZATION>King George III</ORGANIZATION>. But during the 18th and
<DATE>19th</DATE> centuries the trooping was seldom attended by the monarch.
   In <DATE>1895</DATE>, the color was trooped in the quadrangle at <LOCATION>Windsor
Castle</LOCATION>, west of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, and Queen <PERSON>Victoria</PERSON> took the salute from a
carriage. From that year on, a senior royal person has always been
in attendance.

   News that a handsome aide to the queen wrote
personal letters to Princess <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> prompted new Page One speculation
<DATE>Monday</DATE> that <PERSON>Anne</PERSON>'s marriage is on the rocks. But her father-in-law
denied the marriage has broken down.
   Anne herself, the 38-year-old daughter of Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth II</PERSON>,
smiled through a typically busy day of engagements.
   As <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION> Yard investigated the theft of the letters from the
princess' desk at <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s tabloids questioned
in banner headlines whether her 15-year marriage to fellow
equestrian <PERSON>Mark Phillips</PERSON> would survive.
   ``Can This Marriage Be Saved?,'' asked the <ORGANIZATION>Daily Mail</ORGANIZATION>. ``Anne
Divorce Crisis At Palace,'' said <DATE>Today</DATE>. ``Royal Marriage Crisis:
Anne Sad, Shattered, Alone,'' trumpeted the Daily Mirror.
   Maj. <PERSON>Peter Phillips</PERSON>, <PERSON>Anne</PERSON>'s 68-year-old father-in-law, denied
the marriage was washed up. He told reporters: ``It's not the sort
of marriage that ordinary people would understand at all _ they
spend so much time away from one another.
   ``If people are royal, they don't necessarily spend lots of time
together. It's inevitable. Princess <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mark</PERSON> come together and
they part, doing the various jobs which they have got to do.
   ``One does not inquire about when they last got together. ... Of
course their marriage is very unusual.''
   Phillips added, ``Mark rang me <TIME>last night</TIME> (<DATE>Sunday</DATE>). ... He would
confide in me if there was anything wrong but all the conversation
was about horses. ... The marriage side of things was not discussed
at all.''
   The three principals at the heart of the speculation remained
silent on the subject.
   Anne appeared in a happy mood as she carried out a busy schedule
of activities in <LOCATION>northwest England</LOCATION> including opening a <MONEY>$68 million</MONEY>
shopping center in <LOCATION>Liverpool</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Margaret Maguire</PERSON>, a shopper who talked with <PERSON>Anne</PERSON>, said later,
``She is beautiful _ a credit to her country. It is her own life
and the press should leave her alone.''
   Phillips, a 40-year-old commoner and former captain in The
Queen's <ORGANIZATION>Dragoon Guards</ORGANIZATION>, spent the day at the couple's <LOCATION>Gatcombe Park</LOCATION>
estate in western <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>.
   Royal <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON>Timothy Laurence</PERSON>, the 34-year-old bachelor who
wrote the stolen letters, was at <ORGANIZATION>Windsor Castle</ORGANIZATION>, continuing with
his normal duties as an equerry, or aide, to the queen, <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham
Palace</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Rumors of trouble in the princess' marriage have circulated
since <DATE>1981</DATE>. In recent years, she and her husband have spent up to
six months a year apart.
   Anne has become the busiest and one of the most admired members
of the royal family, undertaking grueling travels on behalf of
children in poverty-stricken and war-torn Third World countries.
<PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> has also traveled widely for a variety of business and
equestrian interests.
   On their 15th anniversary on <DATE>Nov. 15</DATE>, <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> attended a <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham
Palace</ORGANIZATION> ball while <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> was giving riding lessons in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s tabloids have tried to link <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> to a former bodyguard
and actor <PERSON>Anthony Andrews</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> to one of his stable girls,
a Canadian public relations executive and <PERSON>Pamella Bordes</PERSON>, a former
Miss <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> who worked as a researcher in the <ORGANIZATION>House of Commons</ORGANIZATION>.
   The latest rumors began after The Sun, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s
largest-circulation tabloid, reported <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that four letters
stolen from <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> had been sent anonymously to the paper and turned
over to <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION> Yard.
   After a <DATE>Sunday</DATE> newspaper told <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> it was going to
name the letter-writer, the palace identified <PERSON>Laurence</PERSON>, who served
on the royal yacht Britannia before become a top aide to the queen.
It described him as a friend of the princess' but refused to
disclose the contents.
   The Daily Mirror, which called the letters ``highly personal,''
said <DATE>Monday</DATE> that the princess had visited <PERSON>Laurence</PERSON>'s home in
Winchester at least half a dozen times, sometimes with her two
children, <PERSON>Peter</PERSON>, 11, and <PERSON>Zara</PERSON>, 7.
   <PERSON>Harold Brooks-Baker</PERSON>, publishing director of <PERSON>Burke</PERSON>'s Peerage,
said: ``The matter cannot be left hanging in the air like this.''
   There is a precedent for a royal divorce. Anne's aunt, Princess
<PERSON>Margaret</PERSON>, the queen's only sister, was divorced in <DATE>1978</DATE> from <PERSON>Lord
Snowden</PERSON>, who has since remarried. Anne herself is seventh in line
to the throne, far enough down the line of succession not to create
problems for the monarchy if she were to divorce.
   <PERSON>Nigel Dempster</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s best-known gossip columnist who writes
in The Daily Mail, said <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> and <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> haven't divorced because
neither wants to marry someone else.
   ``I think everyone including Mark and the royal family have been
aware that the marriage as such had been over for a very long
time,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Anne and Mark to Split; Just Another Soap Opera Episode?</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   All, it would seem, was bliss at <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION>.
   Prince <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> and <PERSON>Diana</PERSON> emerged unscathed from a spate of rumors
about their marriage. Prince <PERSON>Andrew</PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON>, are happily
raising a baby. Prince Edward gave up military life and apparently
found peace with a theater company.
   Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth II</PERSON> was the picture of grandmotherly contentment.
   But now, suddenly, shocking headlines! Headstrong Princess <PERSON>Anne</PERSON>
and her shy commoner husband are splitting up. Is the British royal
family in trouble?
   Not really. It has survived worse crises, only to grow in
prestige and popularity. And compared with the scandals that beset
some of their ancestors, the separation announced <DATE>Thursday</DATE> of the
queen's daughter from Capt. <PERSON>Mark Phillips</PERSON> is small potatoes.
   ``Many, many royal marriages have been very unhappy indeed,''
says <PERSON>Michelle Brown</PERSON>, curator of the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Britain Exhibition</ORGANIZATION>.
``There have been lots of royal divorces in the past, and many
people far more miserable than Capt. <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> and Princess <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> seem
to have been.''
   Like the unfortunate <PERSON>Sophia Dorothea</PERSON>, whose husband, <PERSON>George I</PERSON>,
locked her in a castle for 32 years for being unfaithful to him in
<DATE>1694</DATE>.
   Or, more recently, the drawn-out saga of Princess <PERSON>Margaret</PERSON>, the
queen's younger sister, whose marriage to <PERSON>Lord Snowdon</PERSON> ended in
divorce in <DATE>1978</DATE>.
   And then there was 19th-century <PERSON>George IV</PERSON>, whose attempts to
divorce <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> of Brunswick became a prolonged and disgraceful
public spectacle.
   Anne and <PERSON>Mark</PERSON>, who have two children, do not plan to divorce,
<ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> says.
   While most newspapers ran the split on the front page <DATE>Friday</DATE>, The
Independent ran just one paragraph on page 2. The Independent simply
doesn't believe the royals matter. Others enjoy them as soap opera.
   ``No scriptwriter could wish for a better cast,'' the columnist
<PERSON>Godfrey Smith</PERSON> has written: Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth II</PERSON> as ``everyone's
favorite mum,'' <PERSON>Prince Margaret</PERSON> the ``willful younger sister,''
<PERSON>Prince Philip</PERSON> ``the cantankerous father,'' ``interesting children
(cheerful <PERSON>Charlie</PERSON>, randy <PERSON>Andy</PERSON>, educated <PERSON>Edward</PERSON> and angular Anne),
all sorts of in-laws (divine <LOCATION>Diana</LOCATION>, problem-girl Princess <PERSON>Michael</PERSON>),
grandchildren galore...''
   There is, however, genuine sympathy for Anne.
   Her marriage in <DATE>1973</DATE> to <LOCATION>Phillips</LOCATION>, televised from <LOCATION>Westminster
Abbey</LOCATION>, was dubbed a storybook romance, but rested mainly on a shared
passion for horses, and marital strife has been rumored for eight
years.
   Anne's short temper and caustic tongue earned her an unpopular
image that only changed in the <DATE>1980s</DATE> through her quiet, sustained
and often courageous work on behalf of the world's needy children.
   She may never rival <ORGANIZATION>Princess Diana</ORGANIZATION> in looks, and as seventh in
line to the throne she is unlikely to become Queen <PERSON>Anne</PERSON>. But she is
blessed with wit, poise and intellect, and at 39 she is by far the
most interesting of the British royals.
   ``We are very possessive about our royal family, and we were all,
in a sense, guests at that fairy-tale wedding 15 years ago,'' The
Times editorialized <DATE>Friday</DATE>. ``The queen's daughter has never been a
fairy-tale princess, however, and the monarchy is the stronger for
it.''
   Indeed, the line was taken by some newspapers that the marriage
was a sham, and that its end came as a relief.
   Other European countries also treasure their royals, and scandals
are far fewer. <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> hasn't had any problems since <PERSON>King Leopold
III</PERSON> married a commoner in <DATE>1941</DATE> without his government's approval.
Holland's Princess <PERSON>Irene</PERSON> scandalized Protestants by converting to
Catholicism to marry a Spaniard, but her divorce 17 years later
barely caused a ripple. The Swedish and Danish royal families are
squeaky clean.
   So, for the most part, is the British family. But when it does
arise, divorce is always an emotional issue, from much-married <PERSON>Henry
VIII</PERSON> four centuries ago to <PERSON>Edward VIII</PERSON>, who had to abdicate in <DATE>1936</DATE>
to marry the twice-divorced American, <PERSON>Wallis Simpson</PERSON>.
   ``It was only since Queen <PERSON>Victoria</PERSON> and <PERSON>Prince Albert</PERSON> set up this
wonderful sort of epitome of the perfect family that the pressure
existed,'' curator <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>London Broadcasting Corp.</ORGANIZATION> radio.
   ``Before then, royal marriages had all the rough and tumble and
all the problems of any other marriage and nobody tried to pretend
otherwise.''

   PITTSBURGH -- When it comes to publicity, Mellon Bank
Corp. keeps shooting itself in the foot.
   First, the Pittsburgh bank offended Nabisco Brands Inc.
with a full-page advertisement depicting an Oreo cookie minus
the cream. Nabisco, a unit of RJR Nabisco Inc., viewed the ad
as a violation of the Oreo icon.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Now, a new Mellon ad for a "Phone In &amp; Win <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY>" game
has sent <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> into a tizzy. The ad features a
photo of Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth II</PERSON>, her forefinger pointing at
something. "Your forefinger can get you five figures," the ad
proclaims. Different versions of the ad, which began running
in local publications last month, feature photos of former
Prime Minister <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON> and former Soviet President
<PERSON>Mikhail Gorbachev</PERSON> pointing their forefingers.
   In the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION>, commercial uses of the queen are simply not
tolerated. "It's not done, at least not by reputable firms,"
says <PERSON>Nick Brown</PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>British Embassy</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. Offending companies receive tersely worded royal
reprimands, often from the <PERSON>Lord Chamberlain</PERSON>'s office at
<ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION>. Although the admonitions don't carry the
force of law, <PERSON>Mr. Brown</PERSON> says they tend to discourage
companies from improperly using the royal family's images.
Foreign companies aren't exempt from the consequences of
British indignation. The <ORGANIZATION>British Embassy</ORGANIZATION> sent a letter to
<ORGANIZATION>Mellon</ORGANIZATION> this week requesting the ad be withdrawn.
   What's the big deal? British comics have long made the
queen a butt of ridicule. Consider, for example, the raunchy
irreverence of <ORGANIZATION>Monty Python</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Brown</PERSON> objects to the
comparison. "That's different from trying to use the queen or
the royal family for commercial gain," he says, adding a bit
defensively that "we've got a sense of humor. I'd say
probably more than a lot of Americans have. We're not afraid
of being satirical about public figures. A lot of that goes
on in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>. But this is about whether it's right to use
images of members of the royal family to try to sell a
product."
   A <ORGANIZATION>Mellon</ORGANIZATION> spokesman says the bank pulled the offending ad
before hearing from the British government. The decision was
made, he says, after several customers complained about the
light-hearted treatment of Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON>.
No one seemed to mind with <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON>.
   Mellon doesn't view the tiff with <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> as yet
another publicity gaffe on <ORGANIZATION>Mellon</ORGANIZATION>'s part. Indeed, it believes
the publicity surrounding the Oreo cookie incident worked to
<ORGANIZATION>Mellon</ORGANIZATION>'s benefit. Mellon eventually redid the ad, that time
with the cream intact.
   The bank staunchly defends the ad agency that created both
offending ads, <PERSON>Werner</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Chepelsky &amp; Partners</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>.
"What you want to do with advertising is provoke a reaction,"
the <ORGANIZATION>Mellon</ORGANIZATION> spokesman says.
