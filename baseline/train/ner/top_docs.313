   MONTREAL -- Severe production cuts in March didn't make a
dent in Canadian pulp producers' big inventories. Meanwhile,
Canadian newsprint makers were able to trim their inventories
slightly as shipments picked up.

   MONTREAL -- Canadian production of market pulp rose 16% in
June from a year earlier as the industry operated at 89% of
capacity.
   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry
group, said Canadian mills produced 580,000 metric tons of
market pulp in June, compared with 500,000 metric tons a year
earlier. The June 89% operating rate was up from 84% in May
and from 82% a year earlier.

   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to

   North American Newsprint Producers
   Push Through a Price Increase of 5%

   Most North American newsprint producers pushed through a
scheduled price increase of slightly more than 5% Friday, the
first good news in two years for struggling newsprint makers.
But if labor negotiations in Eastern Canada are settled
without a strike, prices could slide back to pre-increase
levels, some industry executives and observers said.
   "It looks like {the increase} has a better chance of
sticking than it did two months ago," said Homer Taylor, vice
president, supply, at Knight-Ridder Inc. Mason Sizemore,
president of the Seattle Times, said five of his six
newsprint suppliers raised their prices, and, "As far as I
know, it's going through."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Led by <ORGANIZATION>Toronto-based Abitibi-Price Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which said it
expects the price boost to hold, most North American
producers earlier this year announced the increase for <DATE>June
1</DATE>. Producers raised the benchmark <LOCATION>Eastern U.S.</LOCATION> list price of
standard newsprint <PERCENT>5.4%</PERCENT>, or <MONEY>US$35</MONEY> a metric ton, to <MONEY>$685</MONEY> a
metric ton. A similar increase was announced in other
markets, where the pricing system is slightly different. A
metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.
   Newsprint now is sold at about a <PERCENT>19%</PERCENT> discount from list,
so the price increase raises transaction prices, or actual
selling prices, to about <MONEY>$555</MONEY> a metric ton from about <MONEY>$525</MONEY> in
the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION>.
   When the price increase was first announced, many
newsprint buyers said it had little chance of going into
effect. But the supply of newsprint has tightened in the past
several weeks, newsprint buyers said, as publishers built
inventory in anticipation of a possible strike at mills in
<LOCATION>Eastern Canada</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> publishers buy more than half of their
newsprint from Canadian mills.
   Any strike would first hit Montreal-based <ORGANIZATION>Stone
Consolidated Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Stone Container Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Paperworkers Union</ORGANIZATION> targeted certain Stone
Consolidated mills for negotiation of contracts that will
then set the pattern for settlements at other <ORGANIZATION>Eastern
Canadian</ORGANIZATION> mills. A Stone Consolidated spokeswoman said that
negotiations on contract language began last <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, and
that once those points are settled, discussion of salary
issues will start. The union is seeking wage increases of <PERCENT>8%</PERCENT>
a year in each of two years.
   Canadian newsprint producers in particular are desperate
for a price increase. "The average Canadian company isn't
making money" at current prices, said <PERSON>Brian Topp</PERSON>, an analyst
at <ORGANIZATION>Capital Group Securities Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>. Along with
facing higher labor costs, Canadian producers continue to be
hurt by the high level of the Canadian dollar, valued against
the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollar.
   Analysts said that, without a strike, producers will have
to curtail production to make the price increase stick. While
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> output has increased this year, Canadian mills have
already cut some production. Canadian newsprint output in the
<DATE>first four months of this year</DATE> dropped <PERCENT>2.6%</PERCENT> from a year
earlier, according to the <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Pulp and Paper
Association</ORGANIZATION>, an industry group. Canadian mills operated at
<PERCENT>94%</PERCENT> of capacity through the end of <DATE>April</DATE>, compared with <PERCENT>97%</PERCENT> a
year earlier.
   Meanwhile, Canadian producers of market pulp continue to
make sharp cuts in production to keep prices for their major
premium grade pulp from falling. Canadian producers of market
pulp operated at just <PERCENT>77%</PERCENT> of capacity in <DATE>April</DATE>, as production
fell <PERCENT>11%</PERCENT> from a year earlier. For the first four months,
Canadian market pulp production fell <PERCENT>8%</PERCENT> and shipments
declined <PERCENT>13%</PERCENT>.
   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to
producers of paper, sanitary and other products. The
statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or
shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing
mill. <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> is the world's largest producer of newsprint and
of market pulp.

   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- MacMillan Bloedel Ltd. said
it will close its biggest pulp mill for two weeks beginning
June 25, because of soft market conditions.
   The temporary closure of the Harmac pulp mill, near
Nanaimo, British Columbia, will reduce MacMillan Bloedel's
inventory of bleached pulp by about 16,000 metric tons, it
said. The move follows an extended maintenance closedown at
Harmac in March, which curtailed the mill's output by about
15,000 metric tons.

mill and about 100 workers at the company's Thunderbird
sawmill, which is scheduled to close for maintenance during
the same period.
   Canadian shipments of market pulp fell <PERCENT>13%</PERCENT> in <DATE>March</DATE>,
compared with <DATE>March, 1989</DATE>. The big drop in shipments left
producers with 532,000 metric tons of inventory, a 30day

   <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s pulp and paper industry expects output to reach record levels in <DATE>1987</DATE>, and its mills to operate at the highest capacity in almost a decade. 

   The Canadian Pulp and <ORGANIZATION>Paper Association</ORGANIZATION>, an industry group, said in its annual forecast that total shipments of pulp and paper are expected to rise <PERCENT>5%</PERCENT> this year to 24.3 million metric tons from last year's 23.2 million, which was a <PERCENT>7%</PERCENT> increase from <DATE>1985</DATE>. 
The group expects the industry to operate at <PERCENT>98%</PERCENT> capacity this year, compared with <PERCENT>94%</PERCENT> last year and <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1985</DATE>. 

   Analysts said that strong demand and the near absence of new production capacity are likely to lead to price increases, particularly for newsprint and wood pulp. 
The price rises also could lead to a series of tough labor negotiations involving 30,000 paper workers in eastern <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> whose contracts expire <DATE>April 30</DATE>. 

   "This is the best situation the Canadian producers have had since <DATE>1978</DATE>," said <PERSON>Brian Topp</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Capital Group Securities Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Topp</PERSON> said he expects <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> newsprint prices to rise about <MONEY>$30</MONEY>, or <PERCENT>5.3%</PERCENT>, from the current level of <MONEY>$570</MONEY> a metric ton, as early as <DATE>May 1</DATE>. 
Other analysts said they felt the price won't rise until later this year. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> newsprint prices went up <PERCENT>6.5%</PERCENT> <DATE>Oct. 1</DATE>, the first such increase in 2 1/2 years. 

   "The psychology has changed," said <PERSON>Oscar Stangeland</PERSON>, president and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION>Montreal-based Consolidated-Bathurst Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a big newsprint supplier. 
"It is recognized that we are in a more shortage-prone period." 

   "It would seem as if a <DATE>1987</DATE> (price) increase is appropriate," said <PERSON>Mr. Stangeland</PERSON>, although he wouldn't elaborate on the timing and size of such a price boost. 

   But clouding the picture for the paper industry in eastern <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> are talks that are set to begin in <DATE>March</DATE> on a new labor agreement for 30,000 unionized employees at over 20 paper companies. 

   <PERSON>James Buchanan</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Paperworkers Union</ORGANIZATION>, said delegates to a convention here this week have set demands for a wage increase at <PERCENT>7.1%</PERCENT> in the first year and <PERCENT>8%</PERCENT> in the second year of the union's next two-year pact. 
The current average wage rate is <MONEY>$14.10</MONEY> (Canadian) an hour, he said. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Buchanan</PERSON> said the workers' current contract has lost ground to increases in the cost of living, and "we're anticipating catching up." 
He said the union also wants improved pensions, a shorter work week and better job security. 

   But <ORGANIZATION>Consolidated-Bathurst</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Stangeland</PERSON> termed the wage demands as "exaggerated" when compared with recent settlements at forest products producers in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>British Columbia</ORGANIZATION>. 
"One doesn't see how and why <PERCENT>7%</PERCENT> and <PERCENT>8%</PERCENT> would be appropriate." 

   According to the pulp and paper association, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s newsprint shipments are expected to grow <PERCENT>6.5%</PERCENT> this year to 9.9 million metric tons, after rising an estimated <PERCENT>3%</PERCENT> last year. 
Most of this year's growth is expected to come in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> market, which depends on <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> for over half of its newsprint supplies. 

   Offshore exports of newsprint, which surged <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1986</DATE>, are expected to continue growing this year because of last year's decline in the value of the Canadian dollar in relation to European currencies. 

   If the forecasts are accurate, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s newsprint portion of the industry will operate at <PERCENT>99%</PERCENT> capacity this year, compared with <PERCENT>94%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1986</DATE>. 

   <PERSON>Raymond Kilroy</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>, said the forecast for a <PERCENT>99%</PERCENT> operating rate may be overly optimistic, but "if you have an operating rate of <PERCENT>95%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>96%</PERCENT>, it's a seller's market." 
He also expects pulp prices, which have gone up four times in the past year, to continue rising.

   MONTREAL -- Workers at three Stone Container Corp. paper
mills in Quebec narrowly ratified new labor contracts, but
the settlement, which sets the pattern for contracts covering
30,000 pulp and paper workers in eastern Canada, may run into
trouble at other mills.
   "We still face some difficulties in the rest of Canada,"
said Don Holder, president of the Canadian Paperworkers
Union. He said some companies may be reluctant to grant
workers perquisites, such as bonus vacation pay, which are
included in the contracts at Stone Container, a Chicago-based
paper and packaging concern. Given the slim margin of
approval at the three Stone Container mills, rejection of the
contract at some other mills is a possibility, Mr. Holder
said. He said the union leadership is satisfied with the
settlement.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Just <PERCENT>56.4%</PERCENT> of workers at the three <ORGANIZATION>Stone Container</ORGANIZATION> mills
voted in favor of the contract. The three-year agreement
includes an hourly wage increase of <MONEY>85 Canadian cents</MONEY> (73
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> cents) in the first year and <PERCENT>5.5%</PERCENT> pay increases in each
of the following two years. The current base wage at mills in
eastern <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> is <MONEY>15.37 Canadian dollars</MONEY> (US$13.22) an hour.
   The three paper mills are operated by the
<ORGANIZATION>Stone-Consolidated Inc.</ORGANIZATION> unit of <ORGANIZATION>Stone Container</ORGANIZATION>. In <ORGANIZATION>New York
Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Stone Container</ORGANIZATION>
shares closed at <MONEY>$15.75</MONEY>, up <MONEY>12.5 cents</MONEY>.
   Analysts said the settlement may face a rough ride at
certain mills but generally expect that it will be adopted
without major problems throughout the region by the end of
the <DATE>summer</DATE>. They said the agreement at the <ORGANIZATION>Stone Container</ORGANIZATION>
mills removes the threat of an industrywide strike in eastern
<LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, because in pattern bargaining, other sites usually
fall in line with the initial settlement. This in turn may
force North American newsprint producers to give up a <DATE>June 1</DATE>
price increase. "There's definitely going to be pressure,"
said <PERSON>Stephen Atkinson</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Deacon BZW Ltd</ORGANIZATION>.
   The threat of a strike helped most major North American
newsprint producers push through price increases of about <PERCENT>5%</PERCENT>
last month. <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Canada</ORGANIZATION> is a major source of newsprint for
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Canadian publishers. The benchmark <LOCATION>Eastern U.S.</LOCATION> list
price for newsprint rose <PERCENT>5.4%</PERCENT> to <MONEY>$685</MONEY> a metric ton from <MONEY>$650</MONEY>.
A metric ton is 2,204.6 pounds. A similar increase took
effect in other markets, where the pricing system is slightly
different. Newsprint now is sold at about a <PERCENT>19%</PERCENT> discount from
list price.
   In anticipation of a possible strike, publishers built up
their inventories of newsprint this <DATE>spring</DATE>. Analysts said
publishers now will probably reduce inventories.
   Separately on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Pulp and Paper
Association</ORGANIZATION> said Canadian production of newsprint in <DATE>May</DATE> rose
<PERCENT>2%</PERCENT> from a year earlier, as the industry operated at <PERCENT>97%</PERCENT> of
capacity.
   The industry group said Canadian mills produced 847,000
metric tons of newsprint in <DATE>May</DATE>, compared with 830,000 tons a
year earlier. For the <DATE>first five months of this year</DATE>,
production fell <PERCENT>1.6%</PERCENT> to 3,971,000 metric tons from 4,037,000
tons.
   The <PERCENT>97%</PERCENT> operating rate in <DATE>May</DATE> was up from <PERCENT>93%</PERCENT> in <DATE>April</DATE> and
<PERCENT>96%</PERCENT> in <DATE>May 1989</DATE>.
   The association said <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> consumer stocks at the end of
<DATE>May</DATE> totaled 1,299,000 metric tons, a 40-day supply, up from
1,276,000 tons at the end of <DATE>April</DATE>, a 37-day supply. Canadian
mills' stocks at the end of <DATE>May</DATE> totaled 358,000 metric tons,
down from 372,000 tons at the <DATE>end of April</DATE>.

   TORONTO -- Workers at most Abitibi-Price Inc. paper mills
in eastern Canada went on strike, shutting down about 7% of
North American newsprint capacity.
   Analysts and industry executives said a short strike won't
have much impact on the newsprint market. Other producers can
make up some of the production lost at Abitibi's mills. As
well, U.S. publishers and other users had an average 39-day
supply of newsprint on hand at the end of July, the latest
figures available.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But a long strike could cause problems for publishers and
push up newsprint prices. "The newsprint market was pretty
tight already," said <PERSON>Raymond Kilroy</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Nesbitt
Thomson Deacon Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
   Publishers are worried about possible strikes at other big
Canadian newsprint concerns. On <DATE>Friday</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Pacific
Forest Products Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> presented a final offer to workers at
three newsprint mills and one pulp mill in eastern <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>.
The company expects an answer by tomorrow, a spokesman said.
The three <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Pacific Forest</ORGANIZATION> newsprint mills account for
about <PERCENT>7%</PERCENT> of North American capacity.
   Talks with <ORGANIZATION>Abitibi</ORGANIZATION> broke down late yesterday, a spokesman
for the <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Paperworkers Union</ORGANIZATION> said. The company
presented its final offer to the union early yesterday
morning. The union presented a counteroffer yesterday
afternoon but the company wouldn't alter its final proposal,
the union spokesman said.
   Industry and union officials said workers at <ORGANIZATION>Abitibi</ORGANIZATION> and
other pulp and paper mills in eastern <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> aren't happy
with the contract accepted earlier this <DATE>summer</DATE> by workers at
<ORGANIZATION>Stone Container Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s Canadian unit. The <ORGANIZATION>Stone Container</ORGANIZATION>
contract was supposed to set the pattern for workers at other
mills in the region.
   The strike has shut down seven <ORGANIZATION>Abitibi</ORGANIZATION> mills in <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Quebec</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Newfoundland</LOCATION>, six of which make newsprint, <ORGANIZATION>Abitibi</ORGANIZATION>
said. A union official said two other mills in <LOCATION>Quebec</LOCATION> are
expected to join the strike. Abitibi mills at <ORGANIZATION>Alma</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Quebec</LOCATION>,
and Pine Falls, <LOCATION>Manitoba</LOCATION>, which are represented by other
unions, will continue to operate, <ORGANIZATION>Abitibi</ORGANIZATION> said. As well, the
company's two <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> mills aren't affected by the strike. In
<ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading <ORGANIZATION>Abitibi</ORGANIZATION> closed at
<MONEY>$13.375</MONEY>, down <MONEY>12.5 cents</MONEY>.
   Separately, the <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Pulp and Paper Association</ORGANIZATION> said
Canadian production of newsprint rose <PERCENT>1.4%</PERCENT> in <DATE>July</DATE> from a
year earlier as the industry operated at <PERCENT>94%</PERCENT> of capacity.
   The industry group said Canadian mills produced 826,000
metric tons of newsprint in <DATE>July</DATE> compared with 815,000 metric
tons a year earlier. For the year to date, output fell <PERCENT>1.4%</PERCENT>
to 5.56 million metric tons from 5.64 million metric tons a
year earlier. A metric ton equals 2,204.6 pounds.
   The July <PERCENT>94%</PERCENT> operating rate was down from <PERCENT>95%</PERCENT> in <DATE>May</DATE> and
from <PERCENT>96%</PERCENT> a year earlier.
   July shipments fell <PERCENT>3.0%</PERCENT> to 751,000 metric tons from
775,000 metric tons a year earlier. Shipments to <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> rose
while shipments to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and other foreign markets fell.
For the year to date, shipments rose <PERCENT>0.2%</PERCENT> to 5.49 million
metric tons from 5.48 million metric tons in the year-earlier
period.

   Canadian newsprint production dropped <PERCENT>3.3%</PERCENT> in <DATE>July</DATE> from year-ago levels, as strikes during the latest month disrupted production at several paper mills in eastern <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. 

   According to the <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Pulp and Paper Association</ORGANIZATION>, an industry group, Canadian mills produced 791,000 metric tons of newsprint in <DATE>July</DATE>, compared with 818,000 tons a year earlier. 
A metric ton equals 2,204.62 pounds. 

   As previously reported, strikes lasting between a few days and several weeks halted output in <DATE>July</DATE> at newsprint mills operated by <ORGANIZATION>Consolidated-Bathurst Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Donohue Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION>CIP Inc.</ORGANIZATION> unit of <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Pacific Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. 
All of the strikes have since been settled with the signing of new labor agreements.

   MONTREAL -- Canadian newsprint production fell 0.6% in
October from a year earlier as the industry operated at 79%
of capacity.
   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry
group, said Canadian mills produced 706,000 metric tons of
newsprint in October compared with 711,000 metric tons a year
earlier. The October 79% operating rate was down from 85% in
September and up from 78% a year ago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Though production fell slightly, the operating rate was
higher in <DATE>October</DATE> compared with a year earlier because
available newsprint capacity was slightly lower than a year
earlier. Some paper machines that ordinarily make newsprint
were used to make other grades of paper in <DATE>October</DATE> and
therefore weren't included in available capacity.
   <DATE>October</DATE> shipments rose <PERCENT>3.6%</PERCENT> to 735,000 metric tons from
710,000 metric tons a year earlier. Shipments to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
fell <PERCENT>4.9%</PERCENT> to 488,000 metric tons from 513,000 metric tons a
year earlier. A metric ton equals 2,204.62 pounds.
   For the first 10 months, Canadian newsprint production
fell <PERCENT>2.1%</PERCENT> to 7,523,000 metric tons from 7,688,000 metric tons
a year earlier. Canadian mills operated at <PERCENT>87%</PERCENT> of capacity in
the first 10 months compared with <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> a year earlier.
Shipments for the first 10 months fell <PERCENT>5.4%</PERCENT> to 7,232,000
metric tons from 7,647,000 metric tons a year ago.
   The association said <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> consumer stocks at the end of
<DATE>October</DATE> were 1,324,000 metric tons, a 40-day supply, compared
with 1,269,000 metric tons, a 37-day supply, a year earlier.
Canadian mills' stocks at the end of <DATE>October</DATE> were 606,000
metric tons compared with 363,000 metric tons a year earlier.

   MONTREAL -- The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association said
it expects 1991 pulp and paper shipments to rise 1.9% to
24.62 million metric tons from 24.15 million metric tons a
year earlier.
   The industry group said that according to preliminary
figures, Canadian pulp and paper shipments last year declined
about 2.9%, or 715,000 metric tons, from 1989 levels. A
metric ton equals about 2,204.6 pounds.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The association said its forecast is based on the
expectation that the North American economy will start to
grow and inflationary pressures will decrease during the
second half. It said pulp and paper markets should begin to
improve by this <DATE>summer</DATE> and Canadian pulp and paper production
should rise slightly over <DATE>1990</DATE>.
   The association said the ratio of industry shipments to
rated production capacity was <PERCENT>87%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1990</DATE> compared with <PERCENT>93%</PERCENT>
in <DATE>1989</DATE>. It said industry capacity is expected to rise 1.6
million metric tons, or <PERCENT>6%</PERCENT>, to 28.7 million metric tons in
<DATE>1991</DATE>. As a result, the ratio of shipments to rated capacity
is expected to fall three points to <PERCENT>84%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1991</DATE>.
   The association made the following forecasts for Canadian
shipments of pulp and paper products, compared with
preliminary estimates for <DATE>1990</DATE>. All figures are in metric
tons:
