   There are more than 20 million people of
Hispanic origin in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, a nine-year increase of 5{
million, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> reported <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   ``This is our first estimate of over 20 million,'' said <PERSON>Jorge
Del Pinal</PERSON>, chief of the Ethnic and <ORGANIZATION>Hispanic Statistics Branch</ORGANIZATION> at
the bureau. ``It's up from about 14.5 million in <DATE>1980</DATE>.''
   Hispanics constitute <PERCENT>8.2 percent</PERCENT> of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> population and are
the fastest growing large population group. The bureau said
immigration was a major factor in the increase, accounting for
about half of the growth.
   About two-thirds of the Hispanics in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> live in
just three states. <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> leads with <PERCENT>34 percent</PERCENT>, followed by
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> at <PERCENT>21 percent</PERCENT> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> with <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT>.
   <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> has <PERCENT>8 percent</PERCENT> of the nation's Hispanics, and there are
significant populations in <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New
Mexico</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, the bureau reported.
   Estimates are not prepared for every state because ``Hispanics
are not well spread out throughout the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION>Del Pinal</ORGANIZATION>
said.
   The Census report estimated the total Hispanic population of the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> at 20,076,000 as of <DATE>March</DATE>, up from 19,431,000 a year
earlier.
   The largest segment is Mexicans at 12,567,000, followed by
people of Central and South American origin, 2,545,000, <LOCATION>Puerto
Ricans</LOCATION>, 2,328,000, and Cubans, 1,068,000. The balance were of
Spanish or other Hispanic origin.
   Mexicans were mostly concentrated in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, the
report said. Cubans are mostly in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, while <LOCATION>Puerto Ricans</LOCATION> tend
to live in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, and Central and South Americans are largely in
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   While Mexicans were the largest group they are not the fastest
growing, the report said.
   Comparing the estimates for <DATE>1982</DATE> and <DATE>1989</DATE>, the bureau said
<ORGANIZATION>Central</ORGANIZATION> and South Americans had increased by <PERCENT>67 percent</PERCENT>. The
``other Hispanic'' category rose <PERCENT>31 percent</PERCENT>, followed by Mexicans,
up <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT>, <LOCATION>Puerto Ricans</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>14 percent</PERCENT> and Cubans, <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT>.

   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has more than 20 million

  [Excerpt] <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas, 5 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- 
The authorities announced that the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican Army</ORGANIZATION> has been able to 
recover several townships taken over last <DATE>Saturday</DATE> by an armed 
group in the southeastern <LOCATION>State of Chiapas</LOCATION>, although there are 
still some regions that are considered "unsafe." 
  Official Spokesman <PERSON>Eloy Cantu</PERSON> stated <TIME>last night</TIME> that the 
government had virtually recovered control of <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de 
las Casas, <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Las Margaritas</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Altamirano</PERSON>, population 
centers occupied by the so-called <ORGANIZATION>Zapatist National Liberation 
Army</ORGANIZATION> [<ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>]. 
  Nevertheless, in reporting on the events that took place in 
<LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION>, the aforementioned <ORGANIZATION>Mexican Government</ORGANIZATION> spokesman 
explained that "there are still specific areas where conditions 
of insecurity still persist." "Institutional life and normalcy 
are painstakingly being recovered, in other words, with each 
passing moment civilian authority is being reinstated," <PERSON>Cantu</PERSON> 
stated. 
  Dozens of bodies with evidence of bullet wounds where laying 
along <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION>'s streets after the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> was able establish 
control of the last population center taken by the armed group. 
The rebel groups decided to withdraw to the mountain region 
located in the north-central part of <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION>. 
  In <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION>, located 800 kms south east of <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION>, 
Zapatista members attempted to hold on to the last population 
center it originally took. After taking over the first four 
communities, the up until now unknown <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> began to appear in 
other communities such as <LOCATION>Abasolo</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Chanal del Carmen</PERSON>, and 
<ORGANIZATION>Oxchuc</ORGANIZATION>. During the last few hours the rebel group also withdrew 
from <LOCATION>Oxchuc</LOCATION>. [Passages omitted]

<FÊP=106> [Report by <PERSON>Juan Manuel Pereyra</PERSON> and <PERSON>Marisa Lopez</PERSON> from the </F>
"Good Morning From <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>" newscast] 
  [Excerpts] [<LOCATION>Pereyra</LOCATION>] <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s 32 departments register 
different poverty levels. Experts feel that poverty is 
ancestral since its origins date back 500 years. <ORGANIZATION>Oaxaca State</ORGANIZATION> 
has a poverty level of <PERCENT>11 percent</PERCENT> and is the poorest state in 
the country. <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION>, with a poverty level of <PERCENT>0.1 percent</PERCENT>, 
is the least impoverished. <ORGANIZATION>Chiapas State</ORGANIZATION>'s 111 municipalities 
are poor. It is the second most impoverished state in the 
country. The poverty there, as anywhere else, generates 
ignorance. There is poverty, not misery, in <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION>. Poverty 
and the ignorance of those suffering from its consequences have 
become a breeding ground for professional terrorists who have 
pit the people of <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> -- luckily a minority of them -- 
against their institutions. Rural areas have the highest poverty 
levels in this state. Monoculture is the chief occupation of 
the people here. [passage omitted] It is in these areas where 
the level of production and service infrastructure is very low. 
About <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> residents live in rural areas. 
Moreover, <PERCENT>99 percent</PERCENT> of the state's 16,400 towns are rural. 
Poverty in <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> has many indicators. For instance, <PERCENT>60 
percent</PERCENT> of the economically active population earns minimum 
wages. Indians make up one-fifth of the population. Also, <PERCENT>19 
percent</PERCENT> of the people have no income. The illiteracy rate is <PERCENT>30 
percent</PERCENT>. There are no roads. [passage omitted] 
  [<PERSON>Lopez</PERSON>] <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> has a population of approximately 3.6 
million. The current strife zone is located in six of its 111 
municipalities. Four of these municipalities have a population 
of a little more than 360,000 persons, or <PERCENT>11.8 percent</PERCENT> of the 
population. The majority of the people in <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>San 
Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas, <LOCATION>Las Margaritas</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Comitan</LOCATION> de 
<PERSON>Dominguez</PERSON>, the site of <DATE>last week</DATE>'s clashes, work the land. That 
is where one cause of the conflict lies. With almost 
nonexistent land reform following the victory of the revolution 
and inadequate land distribution during the <PERSON>Cardenas</PERSON> eras, 
pressure on the land has displaced a large number of people, 
mostly Indians. [passage omitted]

<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s Latino population, which represents one-third of the Latinos 
nationally, has increased by nearly 2 million since <DATE>1980</DATE>, according to a <ORGANIZATION>Census 
Bureau</ORGANIZATION> estimate released <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The bureau said that the nation's total Latino population has grown by <PERCENT>39%</PERCENT> 
since <DATE>1980</DATE>, rising to a record 20.1 million. Latinos now make up <PERCENT>8.2%</PERCENT> of the 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> population and have a population growth rate that is five times that of 
non-Latinos, the bureau said. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Carmen Denavas</PERSON> said that half of the 6.7 million 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> residents of Latino origin are immigrants. Immigration accounted for 
about <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> of the national increase in the Latino population. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our first estimate of over 20 million," said bureau spokesman <ORGANIZATION>Jorge 
Del Pinal</ORGANIZATION>. "It's up from about 14.5 million in <DATE>1980</DATE>." 
</P>
<P>
The figures in the report are estimates and include illegal immigrants. There 
are no precise figures for the numbers of illegal immigrants in the state or 
the country, and estimates of the number vary widely. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> retains its rank as the state with by far the largest Latino 
population, followed by <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, which is home to <PERCENT>21%</PERCENT> of the nation's Latinos. 
Next are <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> with <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> with <PERCENT>8%</PERCENT>. The report also identified 
<LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> as having significant 
Latino populations. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates are not prepared for every state because "Hispanics are not well 
spread out throughout the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>," <ORGANIZATION>Del Pinal</ORGANIZATION> said. 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, Mayor <PERSON>Tom Bradley</PERSON> joined with Latino leaders and 
celebrities to kick off a city campaign designed to encourage Latino youths to 
stand and be counted in the <DATE>1990</DATE> census. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell your friends, tell your family that Hispanics must be counted to earn 
political power," came a message shouted not from the mouth of a politician, 
but by Latin American rock star <PERSON>Jose Luis Rodriguez</PERSON>, who attended the event at 
<ORGANIZATION>Roosevelt High School</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
And, based on the high-pitched screams of approval from hundreds of teen-agers, 
the words were well received. 
</P>
<P>
The city of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, bolstered with <MONEY>$600,000</MONEY> in funding, has joined forces 
with a host of community and civic groups to find ways to reach traditionally 
undercounted groups, including Latinos, the homeless and those who live in 
overcrowded apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they have targeted high school-age Latino youths because the 
students can pass along census information to their parents and push them to 
fill out forms for the <DATE>April 1</DATE> head count. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the campaign, schools in areas with large immigrant populations will 
be sent census lessons for classroom instruction throughout the campaign, which 
lasts until <DATE>April 1</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The official <DATE>1980</DATE> count missed as many as <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Latinos, according to 
federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau report said that the largest segment of the Latino population 
is of Mexican descent, about 12.6 million. Residents of Central and South 
American origin total 2.5 million, while those of Puerto Rican descent total 
2.3 million and those of Cuban descent account for 1.1 million. The remainder 
are of Spanish or other Latino origin. 
</P>
<P>
While people of Mexican descent are the largest Latino group in the <LOCATION>United 
States</LOCATION>, they are not the fastest-growing segment, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Comparing estimates from <DATE>1982</DATE> and <DATE>1989</DATE>, the bureau said that the number of 
Central and South Americans had increased by <PERCENT>67%</PERCENT>. The "other Hispanic" category 
rose <PERCENT>31%</PERCENT>, followed by Mexicans, up <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT>, <LOCATION>Puerto Ricans</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>14%</PERCENT>, and Cubans, <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT>.

  [Text] <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, 5 Jan (EFE) -- 
The Mexican Armed Forces on 5 <DATE>January</DATE> resumed bombing enemy 
positions in the mountainous zone of <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas, 
<ORGANIZATION>Chiapas State</ORGANIZATION>, civilian sources told <ORGANIZATION>EFE</ORGANIZATION>. 
  At least three helicopters and two planes are participating 
in the bombings that began in early this morning in a zone 
located approximately 4 kms south of <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas 
and where there are 13 Indian towns with a population of 5,000. 
The main towns under attack, where clashes have been held with 
scattered guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION>Zapatista National Liberation Army</ORGANIZATION> 
(<ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>), are: Corralito, <LOCATION>San Isidro</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>El Ocotal</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Corazon de Maria</ORGANIZATION>, 
<LOCATION>San Antonio Los Banos</LOCATION>, and Pinavetal. 
  The residents of <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas have said the 
situation has become "alarming" because the bombings started 
behind the mountain ranges and are now continuing on the 
outskirts of the city, although sources said that at first 
glance one cannot detect the presence of guerrillas. The 
sources could not say how many soldiers are involved in the 
operation but noted there are 10,000 soldiers just in the 
state's capital, <PERSON>Tuxtla Gutierrez</PERSON>, in addition to other 
contingents in <LOCATION>Altamirano</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Las Margaritas</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION>, where 
the fighting continues. 
  Official reports indicate the bombings and clashes have 
ceased, although there is the possibility that the authorities 
have refused to give information on the new attacks to keep it 
from leaking to other rebel groups and warning them. 
  This past <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> alone, approximately 5,000 soldiers, 27 
tanks, two amphibious vehicles, 18 all-terrain vehicles, two 
fuel trucks, a repair unit, and 10 troop transport trucks 
arrived in <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas. Unofficial sources 
indicated that the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> had possibly uncovered several rebel 
headquarters located in the <LOCATION>Lacandona</LOCATION> jungle and those were the 
objectives being bombed at the moment. According to experts, 
the force deployed to <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> is greater than any used by 
neighboring Central American countries against a particular 
guerrilla force. This force has become a genuine military 
offensive. 
  Unofficially it is being said that, despite the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> having 
regained near total control of the municipalities of <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION>, 
the Zapatists continue to harass nearby communities. Ocosingo 
as well as the communities of Altamirano, <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION>, and La 
Margaritas have not yet returned to their daily work or school 
activities, neither has potable water, electricity, or gas been 
reestablished. 
  On the other hand, several warnings have appeared written in 
red on the walls of buildings in the municipality of <LOCATION>Tapachula</LOCATION>, 
located 12 kms from the Guatemalan border, indicating: "We are 
already here, we will continue our struggle," and describe the 
population as cowards. 
  In the meantime, rumors still persist in <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> 
related to the alleged capture of "Commander <PERSON>Marco</PERSON>," leader of 
the armed uprising that broke out this past <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. The 
prosecutor general of the republic has scheduled a news 
conference in the next few hours to provide details on the 
numerous rumors circulating on the situation.

  [Text] The <ORGANIZATION>National Human Rights Committee</ORGANIZATION> [<ORGANIZATION>CNDH</ORGANIZATION>] issued

  [Text] <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, 2 Jan (AFP) -- 
Members of the <ORGANIZATION>Zapata National Liberation Army</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>) remain in 
the towns of <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION>, and they apparently also remain in the 
towns of <LOCATION>Altamirano</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Chanal</PERSON>, and <LOCATION>Las Margaritas</LOCATION>, after suddenly 
leaving <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas, it was reported on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> by 
media sources. 
  The guerrilla members, it was confirmed by TIEMPO newspaper 
in <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION>, burned the municipal palace in <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION> <TIME>early 
this morning</TIME> and continued to hold their positions in the town 
as of <DATE>0730</DATE> (1330 GMT). 
  The <ORGANIZATION>San Cristobal Municipal Police</ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> members 
left 
the city, the second most important one in the Mexican state of 
<LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION>, and painted graffiti on the wall to announce they were 
en route to the town of <ORGANIZATION>Rancho Nuevo</ORGANIZATION>. A local journalist, 
however, noted that the announcement was actually "black humor," 
because the 31st Military Zone is located in <LOCATION>Rancho Nuevo</LOCATION> and 
the guerrilla members "will not walk into the wolf's lair." 
  The <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> members' graffiti indicated they will continue 
along 
their way "to <PERSON>Tuxtla Gutierrez</PERSON> (capital of <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION>) and there 
will be no rest." Other graffiti read: "We do not want <ORGANIZATION>NAFTA</ORGANIZATION>. 
We want freedom and a legitimate government." 
  The authorities have yet to issue a report on the situation 
which prevails in <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Las Margaritas</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Chanal</PERSON>, and 
<PERSON>Altamirano</PERSON>, or to indicate if troops are pursuing the guerrilla 
forces which left <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> and whose whereabouts are 
unknown. 
  According to different reports, the toll of the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>'s 
arrival is six dead -- three in <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION> and three in <LOCATION>Las 
Margaritas</LOCATION>. 
  <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION>, on the Guatemalan border, is located 700 km south 
of 
<LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION>, and it is one of the most backward and poorest 
states in the country and has a predominantly Indian population.

<LEADPARA>  Professor David Hayes-Bautista, a third-generation Mexican-American who sends
his daughter to Mexico for tennis lessons, is part of an immigrant wave that
he says is unlike any other in American history.;    Because of the
geographical closeness of the country of his ancestors and because of modern
communications and transportation, he and other Mexican-Americans are
maintaining ties with their ancestral culture to a degree generally not
possible for other immigrant groups.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Front  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  U.S. HISPANICS LIVING IN TWO WORLDS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The connections are vivid in interviews with Mexican immigrants in <LOCATION>Los
Angeles</LOCATION>, and form a unifying theme in a three-year study of Hispanic cultural
attitudes by <PERSON>Hayes-Bautista</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>Chicano Studies Research Center</ORGANIZATION> at
the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Los Angeles.</LOCATION>;    Although his study did not
separate those of Mexican descent from other Hispanic people, <PERSON>Hayes-Bautista</PERSON>
said he believed that many of the findings about cultural ties could be
generalized to include descendants of <LOCATION>Puerto Ricans</LOCATION>, Cubans or other Hispanic
nationalities who predominate in other areas of the country.;    He said
attitudes expressed by more than 1,000 participants in his study about
language, culture and self-identification led him to the conclusion that
Hispanic people are evolving into a bilingual, dual culture.;    "We could
come back in 100 years and the Latinos will not have assimilated in the
classic sense," <PERSON>Hayes-Bautista</PERSON> said. "I'm pretty sure they will still have a
sense of being Latinos.";    The nation's Hispanic minority grew by about 2.5
million people over the past decade, to about 22.4 million, or <PERCENT>8.9 percent</PERCENT> of
the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> population in <DATE>1990</DATE>, the census found.;    In <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, about 7.7
million people, or <PERCENT>26 percent</PERCENT> of the population, are of Hispanic descent.
Mexican-Americans make up <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of the Hispanic population in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>,
as against <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>65 percent</PERCENT> of the Hispanic population nationwide,
<PERSON>Hayes-Bautista</PERSON> said.;    If Mexican-Americans have stronger cultural ties to
their ancestral country than many other immigrant groups have had over the
years, one explanation is the history of seasonal or temporary migration from
Mexico.;    Jobs in the north are one part of the national dream in a country
that shares 2,000 miles of border with the <LOCATION>United States.</LOCATION>;    In
<PERSON>Hayes-Bautista</PERSON>'s study, many respondents said Hispanic history should be
taught in schools and that children should maintain their families' Hispanic
culture.  </TEXT>

<FÊP=106> [Report by <PERSON>Juan Carlos Santoyo</PERSON>] </F>
  [Text] We arrived in <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas, <ORGANIZATION>Chiapas 
State</ORGANIZATION>, after a long journey, as has been the case in the past 
days. We learned that <PERSON>Eloy Cantu Segovia</PERSON>, the federal 
government's official spokesman in <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas, 
will give a news conference. He told us, as we reported to our 
listeners moments ago, that <PERSON>Jorge Madrazo Cuellar</PERSON>, president of 
the <ORGANIZATION>National Human Rights Commission</ORGANIZATION>, would visit <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION>. 
We will give details of <PERSON>Madrazo</PERSON>'s news conference later. 
  He reported that there were clashes overnight, that clashes 
continued at about 0400, especially in the mountain areas near 
<LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas. It was also reported that the 
rebels managed to corner a squad that was attacking these law 
violators, but the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican Army</ORGANIZATION> rescued them. 
  Cantu admitted that there are still areas where uncertainty 
prevails. The rebels continue to operate out of and to hide in 
houses, as was the case in <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION>. Members of the <ORGANIZATION>Zapatista 
National Liberation Army</ORGANIZATION> [<ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>] are hiding in houses there and 
holding its occupants hostage to protect their own lives. 
  He said that the bodies of 20 <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> members were found in 
<LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION>. According to the observations and estimates we made 
on 4 <DATE>January</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> sustained more than 30 dead here. Cantu 
added that the rebels have sustained 61 dead so far. This is 
the figure registered by the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican Army</ORGANIZATION>, which managed to 
arrest 34 subversives. 
  As for <PERSON>Jorge Madrazo Cuellar</PERSON>'s visit here, <PERSON>Cantu</PERSON> said that 
the priority is to ensure a respect for human rights and the 
civilian population. He added that greater guarantees will be 
granted to reporters to allow us to perform our work. Cantu 
also reported that in a few hours there will be shipments of 
food, potable water, and food to the residents of <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION>, 
which will mark its fifth day under siege, so to speak, or amid 
clashes. 
  Cantu profoundly regretted the incidents involving our 
fellow 
reporters who were sent here. He added that each incident will 
be investigated. We will now hear <PERSON>Jorge Madrazo Cuellar</PERSON>, 
president of the <ORGANIZATION>National Human Rights Commission</ORGANIZATION>, during his 
news conference. 
  <PERSON>Madrazo</PERSON> said that he came with other officials of this 
commission to register complaints and reports on human rights 
violations during the clashes. Madrazo reaffirmed that each of 
these reports will be investigated, because human rights are 
respected and guaranteed in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. He added the following: 
  [Begin Madrazo recording, in progress] ...in <LOCATION>Tuxtla 
Gutierrez</LOCATION>. We initially responded to a request to help in 
evacuating tourists from the conflict area [words indistinct] I 
am accompanied in this work brigade by the first general 
inspector, the third general inspector, experts on criminology 
and forensic medicine, and personnel who are involved in 
investigations and communications. 
  At this juncture of the conflict the <ORGANIZATION>National Human Rights 
Commission</ORGANIZATION>'s work will focus on offering support to civilians 
who have nothing to do with the armed confrontation. The 
commission will also register all existing evidence on alleged 
human rights violations. The investigation and the report on 
conclusions will take place within the terms established by the 
Constitution and the Basic Law of the <ORGANIZATION>National Human Rights 
Commission</ORGANIZATION>. [end recording] 
  These were the highlights of developments that occurred on 5 
<DATE>June</DATE> in <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas, <ORGANIZATION>Chiapas State</ORGANIZATION>.

   WASHINGTON -- The overall U.S. population became
significantly less white and Anglo-Saxon during the 1980s,
largely because of growth in the number of Hispanics and
Asians living in this country, according to the 1990 census.
   The proportion of U.S. residents identifying themselves as
white declined to 80.3% in 1990 from 83.1% in 1980. At the
same time, the proportion of Hispanics increased to 9% in
1990 from 6.4% in 1980. Roughly half of those who identified
themselves as Hispanic, the most rapidly growing minority
group, also identified themselves as white. Asians and
Pacific Islanders grew to 2.9% of the population from 1.5% 10
years ago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition, blacks became a slightly larger segment of
the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> population, increasing to <PERCENT>12.1%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1990</DATE> from <PERCENT>11.7%</PERCENT>
in <DATE>1980</DATE>, and Native Americans grew to <PERCENT>0.8%</PERCENT> from <PERCENT>0.6%</PERCENT>.
Although still an overwhelming majority in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, whites
have shrunk as a proportion of the population from <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> in
<DATE>1960</DATE>.
   Among Hispanics, the largest group remains people of
Mexican origin, followed by Puerto Ricans and Cubans. But the
census numbers suggest that a sizable migration of Central
and South Americans is under way. Between <DATE>1980</DATE> and <DATE>1990</DATE>, the
number of people identifying themselves as "other Hispanic,"
a group largely from <ORGANIZATION>Central</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>, increased by
two-thirds. They now represent <PERCENT>2%</PERCENT> of the population.
   People of Chinese descent remain the largest element in
the growing <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> population of Asians and <LOCATION>Pacific Islanders</LOCATION>,
followed by those of Philippine and Japanese origins. In
addition, the census found significant growth among certain
groups from <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> -- especially the Hmong, who are from
mountainous regions of <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION>, and people from <LOCATION>Bangladesh</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sri Lanka</LOCATION>. Emigres from <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION> and the
Asian subcontinent have been arriving in significant numbers,
but they don't yet represent a large portion of the overall
population.
   Minority groups remain unevenly distributed around the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, with Asians and Hispanics concentrated in the West,
blacks and Cuban-Americans concentrated in the South, and
Puerto Ricans concentrated in the <LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION>. More recent
arrivals, however, appear to be dispersed less predictably.
According to <PERSON>Jesus Garcia</PERSON>, a census statistician, growth in
the "other Hispanic" category was evenly divided among the
<ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION>, the South and the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>, though it was slower in
the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>.
   In addition, people of Mexican, Cuban or Puerto Rican
origin are more widely dispersed than in the past. The number
of people of <LOCATION>Puerto Rican</LOCATION> origin living in <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, for example, more than doubled in the <DATE>last decade</DATE>.
   "When a group gets larger, it simply cannot concentrate
the way it used to," said <PERSON>Marty Riche</PERSON>, director of policy
studies for the nonprofit <ORGANIZATION>Population Reference Bureau</ORGANIZATION>.
   Among Asians, those of Hmong descent were most numerous in
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>, while those of Pakistani
descent were found principally in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>.

  [Text] <LOCATION>San Cristobal de Las Casas</LOCATION>, 5 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- The 
<ORGANIZATION>Zapatist National Liberation Army</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>) has asked Mexican 
nongovernmental organizations to create a "peace cordon 
[cinturon de paz] to avoid pressure, intimidation, or even 
attacks" by the parties involved in conflict. 
  In a communique dated 1 <DATE>February</DATE> and released in this 
southeastern Mexican city on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> [5 <DATE>February</DATE>], it was noted 
that the request was made in view of the imminent start of peace 
talks between Peace and Reconciliation Commissioner <PERSON>Manuel 
Camacho Solis</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>. The fact that the dialogue could be 
held within a conflict zone would entail risks of provocation 
that could obstruct or bog down the dialogue. 
  "With the goal of reducing undesirable tensions to a minimum 
between the parties involved, a security or peace cordon should 
be formed around the dialogue site to avoid pressure, 
intimidation, or even attacks by one of the parties involved in 
the conflict against the other." 
  Meanwhile, Peace Commissioner <PERSON>Manuel Camacho Solis</PERSON> said here 
today that the direct talks with the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> "will be held very 
soon," and he added that "everything is set and there are no 
problems in holding the meeting." 
  After meeting with <PERSON>Samuel Ruiz</PERSON>, bishop of <LOCATION>San Cristobal de 
Las Casas</LOCATION> -- the link between the armed group and the 
commissioner -- <PERSON>Camacho</PERSON> said "we will come out ahead" in efforts 
to find a peaceful solution in <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION>. Buffer zones were 
created to hold the meetings in the area of <LOCATION>Los Altos de Chiapas</LOCATION> 
at the request of <PERSON>Camacho Solis</PERSON>. This request was accepted by 
the armed group on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. The towns of <LOCATION>San Miguel</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Guadalupe Tepeyac</LOCATION>, in north central and southeastern <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION>, 
respectively, were proposed as the two areas that will remain 
free of any armed presence and where the <ORGANIZATION>International Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> 
would provide assistance to the civilian population. 
  <PERSON>Camacho Solis</PERSON> explained this idea is intended "to create 
areas of detente" to support the population that has been 
adversely affected by the conflict. The armed group added that 
it would withdraw its men from <LOCATION>San Miguel</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Guadalupe Tepeyac</LOCATION> 
when the <ORGANIZATION>International Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> installs its camps to provide 
the humanitarian aid. 
  On <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>International Red Cross Committee</ORGANIZATION> announced 
it would restore medical services in certain areas of <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> 
and would organize a program to supervise the health centers run 
by Mexican personnel. According to the plan, the <ORGANIZATION>International 
Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> will only provide humanitarian aid to the civilian 
population and medical treatment to all, including the 
transportation of patients to hospitals in <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> or anywhere 
else in the country as required. 
  Another action that contributed to the progress of the peace 
process was the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>'s sending of a communique to Bishop Ruiz. 
In the communique, the rebels announced they would "shortly" 
release former <ORGANIZATION>Chiapas State</ORGANIZATION> Governor <PERSON>Absalon Castellanos 
Dominguez</PERSON>, who was kidnapped on 2 <DATE>January</DATE>. 
  In another communique addressed to the <ORGANIZATION>Executive 
Coordinating 
Commission of the State Council</ORGANIZATION> of Indian and <ORGANIZATION>Peasant 
Organizations</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> said those Zapatists who "had verbally 
assaulted local residents who did not support our struggle have 
been reprimanded." This communique added: "Neither physical nor 
verbal threats to force anyone to join our struggle will be 
tolerated from our troops and supporters. Our war laws are very 
clear in this regard, and we have already taken action to 
correct the damage done and to prevent the problem from 
recurring."

  [Excerpt] <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION>, 6 Jan (EFE) -- The <ORGANIZATION>Zapatista 
National Liberation Army</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>) today seized Tenejapa, 
approximately 40 km from the city of <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas. 
Meanwhile, fighting continues in the nearby towns of <LOCATION>El 
Corralito</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>San Isidro</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>El Ocotal</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION> de las Bajos, 
<ORGANIZATION>Corazon de Maria</ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION>. 
  Early <TIME>this morning</TIME>, the <ORGANIZATION>Armed Forces</ORGANIZATION> bombed towns near <LOCATION>San 
Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas, forcing many people who live in the 
mountains to flee to the archeological area of <LOCATION>Palenque</LOCATION> or take 
refuge in the city. 
  The rebels today sent a letter to <PERSON>Rigoberta Menchu</PERSON>, winner 
of 
the <DATE>1992</DATE> Nobel Peace Prize, warning her that the Mexican 
Government might accuse the Guatemalan refugees living in 
southeastern <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> of being members of the rebel groups. The 
rebels indicated in the document that the government accepted 
the refugees 10 years ago "to give the world an image of 
humanitarianism and political opening." 
  Nevertheless, they added, that image "is not carried over in 
its relations with our own poor and exploited people, who suffer 
the same policies of genocide and ostracism that are practiced 
against Indian peoples in several Latin American nations." 
  From the beginning of the conflict, <PERSON>Menchu</PERSON> expressed her 
concern about the possible repression of the rebels and the 
conflict's repercussions on the Indian and popular organizations 
of <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION>. She was especially concerned that the return of the 
Guatemalan refugees, which was scheduled to begin now, might be 
hindered. 
  In this regard, the rebels indicated in the letter that "no 
one knows better than us about their poverty and their desire 
for a decent life, which is denied in their own country, and we 
will not be the ones to prevent or use force against our 
brothers' return to their places of origin." 
  Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican Army</ORGANIZATION> today increased its military 
movement in the mountainous areas of <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> and is preparing 
for new clashes with the rebels, who refuse to lay down their 
weapons and are recruiting more peasants to their ranks. 
  The conflict zone has been under siege by thousands of 
soldiers who are guarding all roads, with dozens of tanks, 
helicopters, and airplanes that are overflying the area to 
prevent a new offensive by rebel forces. 
  So far, the armed conflict in <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> has left, according to 
military figures, 96 dead. Unofficially, the number of deaths 
is estimated at 250, including soldiers, rebels, and civilians, 
and the number of wounded is estimated at 1,000. 
  With the intensification of the military offensive, hundreds 
of Indians and peasants are becoming the victim of thefts, and 
many have abandoned their homes and are fleeing to nearby towns 
in search of refuge. The <ORGANIZATION>Mexican Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> has expressed 
its concern over the human rights violations that have been 
committed in the strife-torn area and has urged the government 
not to put down the violence with more violence. 
  <PERSON>Jorge Madrazo</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>National Human Rights 
Commission</ORGANIZATION>, traveled to <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> to investigate charges about 
violations of the civilian population's constitutional rights, 
as well as excesses and arbitrary actions by the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> in its 
attempts to capture the rebels. [passage omitted]

  [Text] <LOCATION>San Cristobal de Las Casas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, 1 Feb (AFP) -- 
Peace Commissioner <PERSON>Manuel Camacho</PERSON> announced in this city on 
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> the creation of two "buffer zones" on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> in the 
towns of <LOCATION>San Miguel</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Guadalupe Tepeyac</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Chiapas State</ORGANIZATION> to 
"create detente areas" following the armed conflict. 
  Camacho read a communique to the media which stated that 
free 
access will be allowed to two "buffer zones" in <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Las 
Margaritas</LOCATION> "as long as weapons are not carried." 
  <LOCATION>San Miguel</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Guadalupe Tepeyac</ORGANIZATION> are villages located far 
from <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> and to which the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> has never had access 
during the conflict because of local guerrilla resistance. 
  Camacho also said that armed members of the <ORGANIZATION>Zapatist 
National 
Liberation Army</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>), which began a military uprising in 
southern <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> on 1 <DATE>January</DATE>, should not be present in the area, 
either. 
  Camacho, who announced a series of actions in support of the 
"life and dignity" of the people in <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION>, did not talk about 
the possibility of a dialogue with the rebels, which remains at 
a standstill. 
  The communique read by <PERSON>Camacho</PERSON> and addressed to the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN 
General Command</ORGANIZATION> said "these will be the first two buffer zones" 
to be established in the state, and he added that "the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican 
Army</ORGANIZATION> from its positions will offer facilities for the movement 
of residents, supplies, and medicines to each one of these 
villages." 
  "The Mexican <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> has already left all areas where it had a 
presence in <LOCATION>Chiapas State</LOCATION>," said <PERSON>Camacho</PERSON> in his message to the 
guerrillas. 
  He said that "traffic will be allowed through the access 
routes" to the buffer zone towns "as long as no weapons are 
carried." He added that the perimeters proposed for these 
places "must be respected." 
  "In these areas there must be no armed presence of the 
<ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>," 
stated the commissioner, and added that the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> 
will provide in both towns "humanitarian health services and 
will assist with supplies." 
  Camacho added that "everyone will receive health care," but 
"only the civilian population" will receive supplies. 
  <PERSON>Camacho</PERSON> said the services provided at the two places will 
consist of health brigades to fight malaria and cholera, to 
provide universal vaccinations and first aid, and to support the 
transportation of patients to hospitals in <LOCATION>Chiapas State</LOCATION> or in 
other places in the country in the cases that may so require. 
  Regarding the supplies, the commissioner announced that 
warehouse and distribution centers for supplying the civilian 
population will be "gradually" installed and that humanitarian 
organizations may support the effort in coordination with the 
<ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION>. He added that the effort "will have full public and 
private support." 
  "With these actions, we all support the life and dignity of 
individuals over all forceful actions and military presence," 
the commissioner stressed.

  [Text] <PERSON>Tuxtla Gutierrez</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>), 7 Jan (EFE) -- The 
Mexican Government has undertaken an operation to help the 
civilian population in <LOCATION>Chiapas State</LOCATION>, victims of the armed 
conflict between the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> and rebel groups since 1 <DATE>January</DATE>. 
  With the intensification of clashes between the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican 
Armed 
Forces</ORGANIZATION> and the rebel <ORGANIZATION>Zapatist National Liberation Army</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>) 
near dozens of civilian towns, thousands of residents are 
without basic services and have fled their homes to save their 
lives. Almost 1,000 peasants and Indians have been caught in 
the middle of the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> bombardment of the mountainous <LOCATION>San 
Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas area and in the midst of crossfires that 
have destroyed homes and crops. 
  In response to complaints by civilians, the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican Army</ORGANIZATION> has 
reiterated that its forces have not attacked civilian towns and 
pledged not to do so. 
  The government, church, and civilian organizations are 
setting up shelters for the Indians and peasants who have fled 
their homes because of the bombings. Thus far two shelters have 
been established in towns far from <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas 
and near neighboring <LOCATION>Tabasco State</LOCATION>, where civilians seeking help 
will be temporarily housed and their safety against rebel 
attacks guaranteed. It is expected that between today and 
tomorrow another two shelters will be opened. Additionally, 
corn, beans, rice, sugar, oil, powdered milk, and soup 
concentrate are being distributed among the most severely 
affected civilians. State-owned <ORGANIZATION>Mexican Petroleum</ORGANIZATION> expects to 
send approximately 20 tons of supplies to the area between <DATE>today</DATE> 
and tomorrow. 
  Hundreds of <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> members have focused on occupying small 
towns in southern <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> to threaten the authorities and 
proclaim fragile victories over the soldiers; in the process, 
they have cut off sewage services and the supply of gas, power, 
and potable water. Dozens of tanker trucks have been sent from 
<LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION> with 50,000 liters of potable water to prevent the 
spread of gastrointestinal diseases among the civilian 
population. As a result of the shortage of domestic gas, the 
operation of a mobile plant has been authorized in the war zone 
to normalize the supply of fuel and to avoid further problems 
for the civilian population. 
  Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION>Institute of Social Security and Services for 
Government Workers</ORGANIZATION> (ISSSTE) has sent ambulances, several tons of 
surgical equipment, analgesics, antidiarrhetics, plasma 
expanders, and first aid material. It is expected that the 
ISSSTE and other medical institutions will continue to send 
medicine, vaccines against typhoid fever and tetanus, oral 
serum, antibiotics, and other first aid material. 
  Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION>National Defense Secretariat</ORGANIZATION> (SDN) reiterated 
today in a press communique that the Armed Forces have not 
staged any attacks whatsoever on civilian targets. "The <ORGANIZATION>SDN</ORGANIZATION> has 
paid special attention to the protection of the civilian 
population and respect for human rights during the course of the 
operations under way in the area," the communique asserts. The 
communique also states that during combat on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> one 
soldier was killed and eight were seriously wounded. The <ORGANIZATION>SDN</ORGANIZATION> 
has officially announced that almost 100 people have been killed 
in the clashes, including soldiers, rebels and civilians, but 
<ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> reports indicate that the bodies of at least 190 
rebels have been picked up from the streets.

  [Excerpts] <LOCATION>San Cristobal de Las Casas</LOCATION>, 1 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- 
<PERSON>Manuel Camacho Solis</PERSON>, commissioner for peace in <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION>, today 
described as "an important step" toward peace a recent 
communique issued by the armed group [<ORGANIZATION>Zapatist National 
Liberation Army</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>] operating in <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> 
communique states that a direct dialogue is "imminent." 
  The message is "an important step toward meeting and 
advancing the process for peace and reconciliation in <LOCATION>Chiapas 
State</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Camacho Solis</PERSON> said in a communique released to the media 
in <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION>, 1,200 km southeast of <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION>. [passage 
omitted] 
  <PERSON>Camacho Solis</PERSON>, in his second communique issued on 1 
<DATE>February</DATE>, 
termed as an additional advancement the fact that the group is 
willing to broaden media coverage of the possible direct 
dialogue. 
  The armed group also agreed today to <PERSON>Camacho Solis</PERSON>' proposal 
for national and foreign journalists to cover the eventual 
negotiations, but the group excluded the private Mexican 
television networks <ORGANIZATION>Televisa</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Television Azteca</ORGANIZATION>. 
  <PERSON>Camacho Solis</PERSON> responded: "My stance is not to exclude anyone 
and to make accreditation and access to the talks subject only 
to the appropriate security measures." 
  The commissioner deemed "appropriate the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>'s suggestion 
for the registration of the media and the procedures for 
coverage to be carried out through the group's mediator, <PERSON>Bishop 
Samuel Ruiz Garcia</PERSON>." 
  <PERSON>Camacho Solis</PERSON>, in his first communique today read this 
morning in <LOCATION>San Cristobal de Las Casas</LOCATION>, proposed to the armed 
group the creation of two "buffer zones" without an armed 
presence to ease the situation and help the civilian population. 
  <PERSON>Camacho Solis</PERSON> also announced that the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican Army</ORGANIZATION> has 
withdrawn from the towns in the conflict area.

  [Text] The most important event featured today in <LOCATION>Mexico 
City</LOCATION>'s newspapers is the following: An armed group, mostly 
Indians, the self-styled <ORGANIZATION>Zapata National Liberation Army</ORGANIZATION> [<ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>] 
-- linked with the Procup [<ORGANIZATION>Revolutionary Workers Clandestine 
People's Union Party</ORGANIZATION>] and the <ORGANIZATION>Poor People's Party</ORGANIZATION>, according to 
state officials -- violently seized on the morning of 1 <DATE>January</DATE> 
the municipal offices in <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas, <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION>, 
<PERSON>Altamirano</PERSON>, <PERSON>Chanal</PERSON>, and <LOCATION>Las Margaritas</LOCATION>, with a toll of at least 
11 dead and dozens of injured -- three in clashes sustained with 
public forces -- according to unofficial sources. 
  According reports from state officials, the Indians -- 
according to witnesses, there were about 2,200 of them -- were 
armed with AR-15 rifles, .22 caliber rifles, and shotguns, and 
they simultaneously stormed the five municipalities. Given the 
situation, the government secretariat warned it cannot justify 
the fact that fair social demands, for which there exists a 
willingness to provide a solution, be used as a pretext to 
violate legal order. 
  A <ORGANIZATION>Government Ministry</ORGANIZATION> communique said the government is 
urging these groups to act wisely, recant, and establish 
negotiations within a legal framework. Meanwhile, state 
officials called these actions a violent provocation. They also 
ordered public security forces to dissuade the armed groups, 
making it possible to seek a solution to their demands, which 
have yet to be stated, through dialogue and legal means. 
  Given the situation, the bishops of <ORGANIZATION>Chiapas State</ORGANIZATION> issued an 
appeal to the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> forces to accept the bishops' mediation in an 
effort to restore harmony and social tranquility in the 
municipalities involved in the conflict. Furthermore, it is 
appropriate to mention that contacts are being maintained 
between federal government officials and state officials in an 
effort to quickly resolve the situation. 
  The declaration of war issued by the <ORGANIZATION>Sandinist National 
Liberation Army</ORGANIZATION>, excuse me, the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>, to the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican Federal 
Army</ORGANIZATION> asks the nation's legislative and judicial branches to 
strive to restore the nation's legality and stability. The <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> 
is asking international organizations and the <ORGANIZATION>International Red 
Cross</ORGANIZATION> to supervise and regulate the clashes that its forces are 
waging to protect the civilian population. 
  The declaration of war rejects any links to drug 
traffickers, 
narcoguerrillas, or any other groups when referring to the 
struggle waged by the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>, which has ordered its military 
forces to advance toward the country's capital, defeat the 
<ORGANIZATION>Mexican Federal Army</ORGANIZATION>, and allow the liberated people to 
democratically elect their own administrative authorities. 
  This is, in short, what is currently taking place in five 
municipalities in <LOCATION>Chiapas State</LOCATION> -- <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas, 
<LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Altamirano</PERSON>, <PERSON>Chanal</PERSON>, and <LOCATION>Las Margaritas</LOCATION> -- where the 
self- proclaimed <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> violently seized the municipal offices and 
where there is a toll of 11 dead and dozens wounded. 
  A report issued early this morning by <ORGANIZATION>NOTIMEX</ORGANIZATION> reports that, 
after stating the need to contribute their efforts to prevent a 
possible confrontation involving the people of <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION>, the 
bishops of <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> agreed to take part as mediators to restore 
harmony and peace in the municipalities involved in the conflict. 
  A communique issued by the diocese of <PERSON>Tuxtla Gutierrez</PERSON> and 
<LOCATION>Tapachula</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Chiapas State</ORGANIZATION>, stated that, in an effort to create 
conditions that will allow a fruitful dialogue, we issue an 
appeal to the so-called <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>, urging it to accept four points. 
The bishops request an end to violence, respect for people's 
lives, the release of kidnapped people, and they urge them to 
put down their weapons, respect the law and human rights, and to 
take part in a dialogue to resolve social problems. 
  The bishops' document mentions that, in the event that their 
proposal is accepted, within the next 48 hours the bishops 
promise to ask the government to establish an office to handle 
social problems in the region. The bishops said they have been 
trying to contact the bishop of <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas, 
<PERSON>Samuel Ruiz Garcia</PERSON>, since <TIME>early this morning</TIME>. Their efforts 
have failed so far, but they add they can count on the 
solidarity of this diocese's pastor. 
  The bishops of <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> note that their agreement to serve as 
mediators was prompted by requests they received from different 
social groups in <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> to search for a solution to the 
problems that have arisen in <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas, 
<LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Las Margaritas</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Altamirano</PERSON>.

   As far as Hispanics are concerned, ``the word minority is
becoming extinct in some parts of the country, although that may
not have hit the policy types yet,'' says <PERSON>Elvira Valenzuela Crocker</PERSON>
of the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican-American National Women's Organization</ORGANIZATION>.
   About two-thirds of the Hispanics in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> live in
just three states. <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> leads with <PERCENT>34 percent</PERCENT>, followed by
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> at <PERCENT>21 percent</PERCENT> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> with <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT>.
   <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> has <PERCENT>8 percent</PERCENT> of the nation's Hispanics, and there are
significant populations in <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New
Mexico</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> reports.
   Latinos are younger, on average, than the rest of the
population. In <DATE>1980</DATE> their median age was 23, compared to 30 for
Americans in general.
   That means more are in the childbearing years and they are
producing a higher growth rate than the rest of the nation. In
<DATE>1988</DATE>, Hispanics averaged 94 births per 1,000 women ages 18 to 44,
compared to 67 per 1,000 for the rest of the country.
   That also means more young Latin Americans are in the nation's
schools, raising the issue of bilingual education in many cities.
   That as-yet-unresolved debate centers on whether it is better to
teach children in their own language while they learn English, or
to immerse them only in English as a means of improving their
skills in that language while they are learning other subjects as
well.
   Only about <PERCENT>44 percent</PERCENT> of Hispanics age 25 and over have
completed high school, compared to nearly <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of
non-Hispanics.
   <PERSON>Cary Davis</PERSON>, a researcher at the private <ORGANIZATION>Population Reference
Bureau</ORGANIZATION>, views the growing Hispanic population as a source of needed
labor in the coming years.
   ``When the baby boom starts to retire in 20 to 30 years, who
will provide the work force? It will be an increasingly minority
and Hispanic society,'' <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> says.
   ``The labor force is going to be very different in the next
couple of decades, with a need for improved literacy and employment
training to educate the work force,'' adds <PERSON>Navarrete</PERSON>. ``We see this
as a challenge for the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, but also a very positve
thing.''
   ``We have to think through what kind of investment to make in a
group with lower levels of educational attainment, that doesn't
have a tradition of education,'' <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> says.
   And <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> cautions non-Hispanics against being ``overly
pessimistic'' about these changes.
   ``They will not be all newly arrived immigrants, there is an
assimilation process going on,'' he says.
   ``Hispanics will soon become the majority of entry-level workers
in some metropolitan areas,'' reported the <ORGANIZATION>Population Reference
Bureau</ORGANIZATION> in a <DATE>1988</DATE> analysis of the Hispanic population.
   However, limited educations and language skills have held down
incomes, with per-capita income in <DATE>1988</DATE> averaging <MONEY>$7,956</MONEY> for
Hispanics, compared to <MONEY>$8,271</MONEY> for blacks and <MONEY>$13,896</MONEY> for whites.
   While many Hispanics are not citizens, the Constitution
specifies that the census count all residents of the country, not
just <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> citizens. Thus, when census figures are used for
political reapportionment and distribution of federal and state
funds, areas with more people _ Hispanic and otherwise _ will be
the gainers.
   Their presence will mean added clout for areas where they live
following the <DATE>1990</DATE> census.
   Between <DATE>1974</DATE> and <DATE>1988</DATE> the number of Hispanic elected officials
in the country grew from 1,500 to 3,300, including 10 members of
the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>William O'Hare</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Population Reference Bureau</ORGANIZATION> has speculated
that minorities, including Hispanics, could gain six to 10 more
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats after the <DATE>1990</DATE> census.
   While Hispanics are not as likely to register as other
Americans, that gap has been narrowed by registration drives in
recent years.
   And when they do register they are as likely to vote as anyone
else.
   In <DATE>1988</DATE>, officials estimate, <PERCENT>44 percent</PERCENT> of voting-age Hispanics
were registered, compared to <PERCENT>54 percent</PERCENT> of blacks and <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of
whites.
   The census report estimated the total Hispanic population of the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> at 20,076,000 as of <DATE>March 1989</DATE>, up from 19,431,000 a
year earlier.
   The largest segment is Mexicans at 12,567,000, followed by
people of Central and South American origin, 2,545,000; <LOCATION>Puerto
Ricans</LOCATION>, 2,328,000; and Cubans, 1,068,000. The balance were of
Spanish or other Hispanic origin.
   In addition to the challenges they pose, <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> points out that
the growing <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Hispanic community can form an important resource
in international business relationships in coming years.
   ``The notion of a smaller world tells us that as we look to
international trade we have a community of representatives who can

<HEAD>Number of Hispanics Up By One-Third This Decade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of Hispanics has grown by more than
one-third since <DATE>1980</DATE> and now represents <PERCENT>8.1 percent</PERCENT> of the nation's
population, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> says.
   In a report issued <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, the bureau also said the rate of
Hispanic growth is nearly five times that for the rest of the
population, and more than half of all Hispanics in this country
live in just two states: <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   The bureau estimated there were 19.4 million Americans of
Hispanic background as of last <DATE>March</DATE>. That is <PERCENT>34 percent</PERCENT> more than
the 14.5 million people who listed themselves as Hispanics in the
<DATE>1980</DATE> census.
   The nation's non-Hispanic population increased by about <PERCENT>7
percent</PERCENT> in the same period.
   About half the Hispanic increase was a result of immigration and
half resulted from birth rates exceeding death rates.
   While people of Spanish ancestry made up a growing share of the
nation's residents, they are extremely concentrated geographically,
the bureau found. About one-third, <PERCENT>33.9 percent</PERCENT>, live in
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, and <PERCENT>21.3 percent</PERCENT> live in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, meaning those two
states account for well over half of all Hispanics in the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>.
   The study did not estimate the Hispanic population of every
state, but it said that nearly <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> live in just nine states.
   Those are <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, 6.6 million; <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, 4.1 million; <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>,
2.1 million; <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, 1.5 million; <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, 801,000; <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>,
648,000; <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, 646,000; <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, 543,000, and <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>,
368,000.
   Other findings of the report include:
   _The unemployment rate among Hispanics was <PERCENT>8.5 percent</PERCENT>, compared
with <PERCENT>5.8 percent</PERCENT> for non-Hispanics.
   _People of Mexican heritage were the largest Hispanic group at
12.1 million. They were followed by Puerto Ricans living on the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> mainland, 2.5 million; Central and South Americans, 2.2
million; and Cubans, 1 million.
   _The proportion of Hispanic families anchored by a married
couple was <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT>, down from <PERCENT>74 percent</PERCENT> when it was last
measured in <DATE>1982</DATE>. At the same time, the share of families headed by
a woman with no spouse present increased from <PERCENT>26 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>30
percent</PERCENT>.
   _More than half (<PERCENT>51 percent</PERCENT>) of Hispanics have completed high
school, and <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> have completed four years of college. That
still trails non-Hispanics, of whom <PERCENT>78 percent</PERCENT> are high school
graduates and <PERCENT>21 percent</PERCENT> have finished college.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION>, 1 Jan (AFP) -- According to several 
sources, a group of Indians rose up in arms today and seized by 
force the mayor's office in <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas in the 
southern state of <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION>. 
  In a communique, the rebels announced the creation of a 
guerrilla group called the <ORGANIZATION>Zapata National Liberation Army</ORGANIZATION> 
[<ORGANIZATION>Ejercito Zapatista de Liberacion Nacional</ORGANIZATION> -- <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>]. The 
communique calls on <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> forces "to advance toward the capital 
of the country, defeat the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican Federal Army</ORGANIZATION>, protect the 
civilian population during this liberating advance, and allow 
the liberated people to elect their own administrative 
authorities in a free and democratic manner." 
  Eyewitness <PERSON>Ernesto Riedwyl</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>AFP</ORGANIZATION> that in <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de 
las Casas some 200-300 people took over the municipal palace. 
According to <LOCATION>Riedwyl</LOCATION>, these people are now engaged in 
destroying and looting the building. Riedwyl said: "They are 
all wearing uniforms with green trousers, brown shirts, and red 
hats and scarfs. They are also carrying weapons of various 
calibers, and they have modern radio communications equipment." 
  He added, "Most of them are Indians, but there are also some 
white people with light-colored eyes." 
  According to this witness, the rebellion began at <DATE>0230</DATE> (0830 
GMT) when the rebels took over the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Palace</ORGANIZATION>, which they 
burned. Later, they took over the <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las <ORGANIZATION>Casas 
Mayor's Office</ORGANIZATION>. According to <ORGANIZATION>Radio Red</ORGANIZATION>, the rebels are also 
causing "disturbances" in other areas of <ORGANIZATION>Chiapas State</ORGANIZATION>, which 
borders <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION>. 
  According to reporters, security forces in <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> have 
tried 
to persuade the rebels to resolve their problems through legal 
means, but this report has not been officially confirmed.

<HEAD>Commission Says Older Hispanics Suffer More, Get Less Help</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elderly Hispanics suffer more financial
hardships and serious health problems than older Americans in
general but are less likely to benefit from Social Security and
private pensions, a private study shows.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Commission on Elderly People Living Alone</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> its
study of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s 1 million older Hispanics shows they ``generally
are not sharing in the economic prosperity enjoyed by other elderly
Americans.''
   The commission, established in <DATE>1985</DATE> by the Commonwealth Fund
philanthropic foundation, said the problems confronting Hispanics in
later years ``reflect cumulative deficits throughout life.''
   For example, it said, <PERCENT>73 percent</PERCENT> of elderly Hispanics received an
eighth-grade education or less and <PERCENT>39 percent</PERCENT> speak only Spanish.
   ``These handicaps have consigned many elderly Hispanics
throughout their lifetimes to jobs that offered low pay and no
pension or health insurance benefits,'' the commission said.
``Despite having worked for most of their lives, many Hispanics find
themselves in old age without the means to maintain their
independence.''
   Higher levels of education and English fluency may help younger
Hispanics get better jobs and retirement benefits, but school-age
Hispanics have high dropout rates and ``many may already be on their
way to lives of low-paying jobs and poverty,'' the report said.
   Advocates for the elderly were to discuss the federal
commission's report at a hearing today of the <ORGANIZATION>House Select Committee
on Aging</ORGANIZATION>.
   The study, based on a national survey of 2,299 older Hispanics,
found <PERCENT>22 percent</PERCENT> of elderly Hispanics live below the federal poverty
line, compared with <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> of all elderly Americans. Fifty-four
percent of older Hispanics report poor or fair health, compared with
<PERCENT>35 percent</PERCENT> of all elderly.
   Forty-eight percent of Hispanic elders are very satisfied with
their lives, compared with <PERCENT>64 percent</PERCENT> of all elderly, the survey
found.
   Hispanics currently make up <PERCENT>3 percent</PERCENT> of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> elderly
population, but are the fastest-growing segment of the senior
population. Their ranks are expected to quadruple to 4 million by
the <DATE>year 2020</DATE>, when they will make up <PERCENT>8 percent</PERCENT> of the elderly
population, the commission said.
   It attributed lower percentages of Social Security and private
pension beneficiaries among today's elderly Hispanics to the
immigration of some later in life and to their work in service,
unskilled and farm jobs with few benefits.
   Seventy-seven percent of elderly Hispanics receive Social
Security, compared with <PERCENT>92 percent</PERCENT> of all elderly; <PERCENT>19 percent</PERCENT> of
older Hispanics receive a pension, compared with <PERCENT>45 percent</PERCENT> of all
elderly, the survey found.
   Because of their lower incomes, <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> of poor elderly
Hispanics receive benefits under <ORGANIZATION>Supplemental Security Income</ORGANIZATION>, a
government program providing minimum income to poor people who are
elderly, blind or disabled. Sixty-seven percent of poor older
Hispanics are eligible for the benefits, but many don't know they
qualify, the report said.
   Although the report found poverty and health problems throughout
the elderly Hispanic population, there were differences among
different ethnic categories.
   For example, because elderly Mexican-Americans were the most
likely to have been born in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and work there longer,
<PERCENT>85 percent</PERCENT> received Social Security benefits. But <PERCENT>74 percent</PERCENT> of
Puerto Ricans living in the continental <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <PERCENT>66 percent</PERCENT>
of Cuban-Americans receive the benefits.
   Cuban-Americans were the best educated and had the lowest poverty
rate _ <PERCENT>35 percent</PERCENT> _ compared with <PERCENT>42 percent</PERCENT> for <LOCATION>Puerto Ricans</LOCATION> and
<PERCENT>43 percent</PERCENT> for Mexican-Americans.

  [Excerpts] The civilian population in <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las 
Casas, <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Abasolo</PERSON>, <PERSON>Chanal del Carmen</PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION>Las Margaritas</ORGANIZATION> 
face an uncertain situation, fearing new surprise attacks by the 
so-called <ORGANIZATION>Zapata National Liberation Army</ORGANIZATION>, which has declared a 
war on the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican Army</ORGANIZATION>. 
  There are scenes of destruction and death today. Members of 
the armed group are warning they will not remain entrenched. 
They intend to advance to the central part of the state and the 
country to demand the formation of what they call a free and 
democratic government. 
  The most recent offensive launched by the armed group 
resulted in the kidnapping of former <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> Governor General 
<PERSON>Absalon Castellanos</PERSON>. Approximately 40 heavily armed men arrived 
at his ranch in Margaritas municipality. There is still no clue 
as to the whereabouts of <PERSON>Absalon Castellanos</PERSON>. 
  Today, the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican Army</ORGANIZATION> controls the city of <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> 
de 
las Casas, which was suddenly abandoned by the rebels who tried 
to storm the 31st Military Zone's general headquarters. 
However, the action was successfully repelled by the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican 
Army</ORGANIZATION>. 
  Clashes between the two sides in two days have left 57 dead. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> has decided not to go into areas of conflict 
given the lack of security for its humanitarian work. This 
follows attacks on two <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> ambulances in <LOCATION>San Cristobal de 
las Casas</LOCATION>, where a rescue team member was killed. The <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> 
is warning it lacks medicine and the necessary material to 
handle the emergency. [passage omitted] 
  The Judicial Police and the <ORGANIZATION>General Secretariat of 
Protection 
and Highways</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION> have launched a special security 
operation which includes heightened security at government 
facilities, media installations, and embassies. This is being 
done as a precautionary measure to prevent any surprise takeover.

<FÊP=106> [Report by <PERSON>Carlos Santoyo</PERSON> from <LOCATION>San Cristobal de Las Casas</LOCATION>, </F>
<LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION>; from the "Acir Radio News" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] Indian and peasant organizations concluded a meeting 
in <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de <LOCATION>Las Casas</LOCATION> and announced an agreement to 
block roads, occupy government agency buildings related to 
agricultural and livestock production, and take over the <ORGANIZATION>Chamber 
of Deputies</ORGANIZATION> and congressional headquarters. <PERSON>Jorge Arturo Luna</PERSON>, 
a leader of the <ORGANIZATION>Independent Peasants Central Organization</ORGANIZATION> [CCI], 
reported that the peasant demand for greater participation in 
agricultural issues should be reinforced with enhanced grain 
crop yield and land tenure protection controls. Therefore, they 
say, Article 27 of the Constitution should be reformed. They 
added that Article 4 should also be changed to give Indian 
communities more rights and greater recognition of their worth 
and political participation nationwide. The peasant 
organizations announced that another national meeting will be 
held on 22 <DATE>March</DATE> in <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION>. Agricultural and Indian 
organizations from all over the country will participate in this 
meeting. 
  The important thing now, though, is that the <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> 
is said to be justifying the recent land invasions. We spoke 
with Father <PERSON>Joel Padron</PERSON>, parish priest of <PERSON>Simon Jovel</PERSON>, which is 
a community about three and one half hours away from <LOCATION>San 
Cristobal de Las Casas</LOCATION>. It is noteworthy that Fr. <PERSON>Joel Padron</PERSON> 
said that the hunger, poverty, and destitution among Indians and 
peasants is high and explained that this is why they are seeking 
some way to support their families. He added that the church 
has no part in the issue of land invasion or the armed movement 
of last <DATE>January</DATE>. He went on to say that the church is not to 
blame for the hunger and, especially, for the deaths of 
thousands of children, or for the indigence of thousands of 
Indians. <PERSON>Joel Padron</PERSON> also said that the church must also change 
is attitude, because it -- along with the political parties -- 
has been left behind by society in general and by a community 
that has organized itself to struggle in defense of its rights. 
  [Begin Padron recording] The civilian population is 
awakening 
with the events in <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> and claiming its rightful place. I 
believe the political parties must feel left behind by the 
civilian society. They have new challenges at every turn. How 
can they offer these discontented groups, who have been rejected 
for so long any truly dependable solutions? How can they 
respond to the civilian population? The community is capable of 
making a more constructive contribution to the peace process. I 
believe the civilian population, as such, which goes beyond any 
political party, does not respond to any specific group interest 
or any political interest. It is more interested in creating a 
new <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. [end recording] 
  He said that a new <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> should rise from the movement 
that 
began in <DATE>January</DATE>. It should become a new state where justice is 
pure; deprivation is left behind; peasants are given their 
rights, especially their right to speak out, because they were 
never allowed to do so. 
  <PERSON>Joel Padron</PERSON> added that one guarantee that must be secured in 
order to attain peace in this state is that the community in 
general be allowed to participate in the peace process. The 
church cannot remove itself from this process and must become a 
true promoter of peace, and never extricate itself. He 
responded to those critics who are calling for Monsignor <PERSON>Samuel 
Ruiz</PERSON> and himself to resign. Those demanding this are mistaken, 
because the church does not promote violence. Violence has 
appeared because of the hunger and poverty of thousands of 
people who are seeking some way to support their families.

  [Text] <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas, 6 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- Today 
in <LOCATION>Chiapas State</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican Army</ORGANIZATION> continued to pursue the armed 
groups which, during their retreat, launched a propaganda 
campaign. Meanwhile, the government provided food and supplies 
to the adversely affected population. The people who have been 
adversely affected by the violence in central-northern <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> 
over the past six days have begun to receive food, clothing, and 
water in the wake of the destruction of the infrastructure in 
the area, official sources said. 
  The government had announced that starting <DATE>Thursday</DATE> it would 
begin distributing those goods that are in low supply in the 
stores in the area of <LOCATION>Los Altos de Chiapas</LOCATION> -- the area from 
which the rebels emerged <DATE>last Saturday</DATE>. Just as in other towns, 
residents of <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas, located some 800 km 
southeast of <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION>, are carrying out their daily chores 
under the protection of a large military contingent, according 
to eyewitnesses. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> is pursuing the armed groups, which began 
retreating 
to the mountains following the operations carried out by 
military forces, which have received air support in the place 
known as <LOCATION>El Corralito</LOCATION>, more than 4 km south of <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION>. 
The operations are limited to the mountainous region of <LOCATION>Los 
Altos</LOCATION>, where the takeover of towns and clashes with the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> 
have officially led to 100 deaths, 34 arrests, and an 
undetermined number of people wounded. 
  The armed groups of the so-called <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> [<ORGANIZATION>Zapatista National 
Liberation Army</ORGANIZATION>] today launched a propaganda campaign with 
fliers handed out to the press, in which they claim a "right to 
speak," although they have rejected the government's proposal 
for a dialogue. The government requested on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> an end to 
the attacks, the surrender of weapons, a return of hostages and 
those kidnapped, and the identification of the leaders of the 
armed groups as prerequisites for establishing a dialogue. 
  In their campaign, the armed groups assert that they are 
fighting to end the "violence of poverty," as well as in support 
of the lower classes and socialism, even though their leaders 
asserted in the beginning that "we are not communists or 
socialists." 
  The government reported on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that one of the 34 
rebels captured was the Guatemalan national <PERSON>Jesus Sanchez 
Galicia</PERSON>, who admitted he participated with the armed groups and 
that he received military training in <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION>. The Mexican 
authorities are ruling out the possibility of the "organized" 
participation of the guerrilla <ORGANIZATION>Guatemalan National Revolutionary 
Unity</ORGANIZATION>, although they consider it possible that there has been 
personal participation of foreigners, especially from <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> 
and <LOCATION>El Salvador</LOCATION>.

  [Text] <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas, 8 Jan (DPA) -- Members 
of the Indian communities settled in the mountains near <LOCATION>San 
Cristobal</LOCATION> de <ORGANIZATION>Las Casas</ORGANIZATION> are beginning to panic due to operations 
by the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican Army</ORGANIZATION> to "comb" the area for guerrillas of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Zapatist National Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>. 
  "Please tell the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> that we are not Zapatists and to give 
us a warning before they bomb the area because we are very 
scared," a group of Chamulas Indians living in the <LOCATION>Zontehuitz</LOCATION> 
and <LOCATION>Tenejapa</LOCATION> area, where military actions have concentrated 
during the past 48 hours, told journalists. 
  Although there is no evidence of injuries among the civilian 
population, rockets fired from "Pilatus" planes and shooting 
from tanks and armored vehicles have made that wooded 
mountainous region a veritable inferno for its inhabitants. 
  According to the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Ministry</ORGANIZATION>, the area was bombed 
during 
the pursuit of 400 <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> guerrillas who were planning to sabotage 
a microwave tower on Huitepec Hill, a strategic communications 
point in southeastern <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. The bombing began at dusk on 9 
<DATE>December</DATE> and grew more intensity on the morning of 10 <DATE>December</DATE>. 
According to the same source, the rebels managed to damage 
three airplanes and two helicopters. 
  Witnesses said that at least four airplanes, three 
helicopters, 12 tanks, combat vehicles and artillery-equipped 
jeeps participated in the actions, as well as an undetermined 
number of troops, who were transported to the area in 10 trucks. 
  Just as it happened with the settlers in the southeastern 
mountains -- where the communities of Corralito and <LOCATION>San Antonio 
Banos</LOCATION>, which were also bombed for three days, are situated -- 
the inhabitants of Zontehuitz and Tenejapa told journalists 
they have not seen any guerrillas in that region. 
  According to nongovernmental organizations in <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION>, 
the bombings during the first days of the week against areas 
near <LOCATION>Corralito</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>San Antonio Banos</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>San Isidro Ocotal</LOCATION>, 
southeast of the city, caused more than 2,000 Chamulas Indians 
to flee. 
  These organizations, grouped in an alliance called "Chiltac" 
-- which in the Tzotzil language means "companero" -- said that 
the majority of Indians sought refuge in the same hills so they 
would be near their homes. Only a few have moved to <LOCATION>San 
Cristobal</LOCATION> for safety. 
  San <PERSON>Cristobal Bishop Samuel Ruiz</PERSON> said he has no information 
on the situation in the conflict area because land and telephone 
communications have been cut off. "I have been unable to 
communicate with my pastors or representatives," he said. 
  On <DATE>Thursday</DATE> the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> placed a viselike grip on the 
guerrilla's territory in what seemed like the beginning of a 
vast offensive to "clean up" the region following the retreat of 
rebel forces into the mountains. 
  Armored personnel carriers and troops on alert are denying 
access to the area, which is a triangle covering several hundred 
square kilometers with points at <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas, 
<LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Las Margaritas</ORGANIZATION>. 
  During this apparent offensive, the army recovered control 
in 
the majority of the towns previously occupied by the rebels such 
as Huixtan, <LOCATION>Oxchuc</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Altamirano</PERSON> without pressure from the 
military. 
  There is no independent information about the fate of the 
civilian population within the triangle of operations, although 
the military command allowed the government's <ORGANIZATION>National Human 
Rights Commission</ORGANIZATION> to send a representative into <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION> 
yesterday. 
  The commission president, <PERSON>Jorge Madrazo</PERSON>, who has been in <LOCATION>San 
Cristobal</LOCATION> since <DATE>last Wednesday</DATE>, asked local and military 
authorities to provide shelters for the refugees immediately.

permitted civilian authorities to carry out their normal

assistance to the population. 
  Soldiers continue to assist the civilian population by

  The <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> will continue to participate in these humanitarian 
tasks and will assist civil institutions and organizations that 
require its assistance.

<FÊP=106> [Report by Gerardo Tena] </F>
  [Text] <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, 4 Jan (AFP) -- 
<PERSON>Samuel Ruiz</PERSON>, <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas bishop, spotlighted 
today reports on the execution of rebel Indians by the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican 
Army</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chiapas State</LOCATION>, site of fighting in the past few days. 
  There are reports that certain guerrillas captured by the 
<ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> have been executed, the bishop said during a news 
conference. The bishop also said that it is "foreseeable" the 
civilian population will be repressed by the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>, because there 
has not been a delimitation of the battlefields where soldiers 
are fighting the guerrilla <ORGANIZATION>Zapatista National Liberation Army</ORGANIZATION> 
(<ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>). 
  The bishop, who held a news conference minutes before the 
<ORGANIZATION>Air 
Force</ORGANIZATION> bombed a hill in the outskirts of <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION>, said that 
approximately 12,000 <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> troops are deployed in the strife-torn 
region. 
  The prelate, who is involved in the defense of human rights, 
particularly that of poor Indians, said that the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>'s massive 
military response "seems to be a decision" to totally crush the 
movement, and in this framework "there are many wounded people 
who have not even been counted." 
  Ruiz called on the two sides to agree on a cease-fire so as 
to begin negotiations with the church mediation to lay the 
foundations for a concerted effort to end the conflict, which 
broke out on 1 <DATE>January</DATE> when <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> members violently occupied five 
municipalities in the southern State of <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION>. 
  He recommended that the situation be observed by national 
and 
foreign human rights observers, and he mentioned that <ORGANIZATION>Americas 
Watch</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Amnesty International</ORGANIZATION>, and Lawyers of <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> are 
willing to come to the region to observe the situation.

<HL> More Firms Court Hispanic Consumers -- But Find Them a Tough Market to Target </HL>

<TEXT>
   Last year when <ORGANIZATION>Campbell Soup Co.</ORGANIZATION> launched a major assault on the Hispanic market, it used three different ad campaigns on Spanish-language television: one aimed at Hispanics of <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> origin, another for Mexican-Americans, and a third that mixed elements from the other two. 

   Hispanics, clearly, are not an easy group to target. 
Yet an increasing number of major companies are courting the Hispanic consumer. 
To these companies, Hispanics -- the second fastest-growing population group in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> -- is a market that can't be ignored. 

   Last fall, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> reported that since <DATE>1980</DATE>, the country's Hispanic population had increased by <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT>, to 18.8 million from 14.5 million -- five times the growth rate of non-Hispanics. 
And although the Hispanic advertising market is still small at <MONEY>$491 million</MONEY>, it grew <PERCENT>23%</PERCENT> last year, according to Hispanic Business magazine. 

   "Anybody who looks at the size of the Hispanic consumer segment would have to be nuts not to do business there," says <PERSON>Charles E. Morrison</PERSON>, a vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola USA</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola Co</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Other companies agree. 
In the past year such major marketers as <ORGANIZATION>Pillsbury Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Burger King Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Southland Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s 7-Eleven Stores, and <ORGANIZATION>Domino's Pizza Inc.</ORGANIZATION> began comprehensive Spanish-language advertising campaigns for the first time. 

   Coca-Cola has used such Hispanic celebrities as <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> Dodger pitching star <PERSON>Fernando Valenzuela</PERSON>, while <ORGANIZATION>Pepsi Cola</ORGANIZATION> has featured the <ORGANIZATION>Miami Sound Machine</ORGANIZATION>. 
In <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, the wealthiest Latin enclave in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>American Express Co.</ORGANIZATION> plans to feature prominent Hispanics in a Spanish-language version of its Portraits campaign. 

   And <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION>, aside from promoting its soup, is making a major push into the Hispanic market with a line of Caribbean-type foods. 
The company plans to sell over 50 items under the Casera label, going head-to-head with <ORGANIZATION>Goya Foods Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>Secaucus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, concern that dominates that market with estimated <DATE>1987</DATE> sales of about <MONEY>$275 million</MONEY>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION> also has begun test-marketing some Mexican food items in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> under the Casera label. 

   "It's a population whose importance can't be denied any longer," says <PERSON>Liz Castells</PERSON>, product manager for <ORGANIZATION>Campbell Soup</ORGANIZATION>'s Hispanic food unit. 
"That's the bottom line." 

   Spanish-speaking television is flourishing as well -- providing better opportunities to reach the Hispanic audience. 
Since last <DATE>August</DATE>, a partnership of <ORGANIZATION>Hallmark Cards Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and a unit of <ORGANIZATION>First Chicago Corp.</ORGANIZATION> have spent more than <MONEY>$500 million</MONEY> to purchase 10 Spanish-language television stations as well as a television network. 
The acquisition of an eleventh network is pending. 
A partnership managed by <PERSON>Saul Steinberg</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Reliance Group Holdings Inc.</ORGANIZATION> has spent around <MONEY>$325 million</MONEY> to form its own rival network. 

   Another sign of the emergence of the Hispanic market is the interest of mainstream advertising agencies, many of which are either starting up their own Spanish-language shops or acquiring existing agencies. 
Last <DATE>December</DATE>, the British giant, <ORGANIZATION>WPP Group PLC</ORGANIZATION>, bought <LOCATION>Newport Beach</LOCATION>, Calif.-based <PERSON>Mendoza</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Dillon &amp; Asociados</ORGANIZATION>, the largest independent Hispanic ad agency in the country with <DATE>1987</DATE> billings of <MONEY>$36 million</MONEY>. 

   "They are getting heat from clients," <PERSON>Edward Fitch</PERSON>, a senior editor at Advertising Age, says of the agencies. 
His magazine recently began a two-page monthly section on the Hispanic market to satisfy greater reader interest. 

   Still, it's an embryonic market and some agencies remain unconvinced of its importance. 
It also isn't an easy market to understand -- or crack. 

   The Hispanic population, for instance, is highly concentrated, which might seem to make a wide-reaching national ad campaign fairly easy to execute. 
Fifty-four percent live in just two states -- <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. 
According to <ORGANIZATION>Strategy Research Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> market research firm, <PERCENT>32.8%</PERCENT> live in seven other states. 

   But the concentration is a bit deceiving. 
Mexican-Americans make up about <PERCENT>63%</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Hispanics and dominate the market in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Southwest</LOCATION>. 
Cubans are a far smaller group, but their higher income and heavy concentration in <LOCATION>South Florida</LOCATION> make <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> the country's most important Hispanic media market, after <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. 
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, the nation's third-richest Hispanic market, has significant Dominican and Puerto Rican populations. 

   "We are just a bunch of segmented markets within a large market," says <PERSON>Carlos Rossi</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Puerto Rican</LOCATION> president of <ORGANIZATION>New York-based Conill Advertising Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, who helped to design the <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION> ads. 

   Some companies use one ad for the entire Hispanic community. 
But others, like <ORGANIZATION>Campbell Soup</ORGANIZATION>, opt for a varied ad campaign in an effort to reach specific audiences. 
What plays to <LOCATION>Caribbean Hispanics</LOCATION>, they find, doesn't necessarily work with Mexican-Americans. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION> ads, for instance, all feature a woman cooking but differ in such details as the age of the character, the setting and the music. 
The version for <ORGANIZATION>Caribbean Hispanics</ORGANIZATION> has a grandmother cooking in a plant-filled kitchen to the sounds of salsa and merengue. 
The Mexican-American ad shows a young wife, preparing food in a brightly colored "southwestern-style" kitchen, with pop music playing in the background, according to <PERSON>Mr. Rossi</PERSON>. 

   The choice of language isn't even a simple decision. 
Although most Hispanics prefer to speak Spanish, many younger, more-affluent Hispanics prefer English, which is dominant in such key markets as <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Albuquerque</LOCATION>. 

   Despite the difficulties, though, many companies are determined to tap the Hispanic market. 
For some, in fact, it's become a necessity, as their products have gone out of fashion in other markets. 

   Hispanics, for example, use three to four times as much cooking oil as increasingly health-conscious non-Hispanics. 
As a result, Hispanics account for over <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Mazola</ORGANIZATION>'s sales. 
Last year, when ad budgets were tight, <ORGANIZATION>CTC International Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>Englewood Cliffs</LOCATION>, N.J.-based company that makes <LOCATION>Mazola</LOCATION>, spent more money advertising the oil in the Hispanic market than in the general market, says <PERSON>Michael Lyons</PERSON>, group product manager for <ORGANIZATION>Mazola</ORGANIZATION> oil and margarine. 
"One million dollars in the Hispanic market," says <PERSON>Mr. Lyons</PERSON>, "will take you further than <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> in the general market."

<FÊP=106> [From the "Panorama" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Members of the <ORGANIZATION>Zapatist National Liberation Army</ORGANIZATION> 
[<ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>] have released a five-point proposal to begin a dialogue 
with the government. They are demanding the recognition of the 
<ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> as a belligerent force, a cease-fire by both parties, the 
<ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>'s withdrawal from all the communities--with a full respect 
for human rights--and the suspension of the indiscriminate 
bombardment of rural towns. 
  In the communique, in which it discloses this proposal, the 
<ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> says that it does not have in its ranks or its leadership 
any foreigner nor has it ever received any support or advice 
from revolutionary movements of other countries or foreign 
governments. 
  We have a report by <PERSON>Juan Carlos Santoyo</PERSON> from <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> 
de 
las Casas: 
  [<PERSON>Santoyo</PERSON>] The <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> has issued its first official communique 
describing as unacceptable the federal government's conditions 
for a dialogue. It added that it will put down its weapons when 
its demands are fully met. 
  In the five-page document delivered to the newspaper EL 
TIEMPO of <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas, the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> establishes five 
points that must be followed to begin a dialogue: 
  1. The recognition of the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> as a belligerent force. 
  2. A cease-fire by both parties throughout the territory 
involved in the conflict. 
  3. The withdrawal of federal troops from all the 
communities, with a full respect for the human rights of the 
rural population and the return of federal troops to their 
respective garrisons in the different places of the country. 
  4. The suspension of the bombardment of rural towns. 
  5. Based on the compliance with the previous conditions, the 
<ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> is proposing the creation of a national commission for 
intermediation [intermediacion]. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> adds that its troops vow to respect these 
conditions 
if the federal government does likewise; otherwise, it warns, 
the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> will continue its military actions in the various 
regions. 
  It says that it will abide by the laws of war as approved by 
the <ORGANIZATION>Geneva Convention</ORGANIZATION>, respecting the civilian population, the 
<ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION>, the media, the wounded, and the enemy troops that 
surrender without a fight. 
  Furthermore, in six points, it explains the reason for its 
struggle and the reason to clarify various matters regarding the 
<ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> movement. First, it says that it has no foreigners in its 
ranks or among its leadership. Second, it also denies that it 
has any ties or links with Catholic religious authorities or of 
any other denomination. 
  A third point stresses that its ranks consist of Chiapas 
Indians who are the most humiliated and unprotected people in 
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. 
  In the fourth point, the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> admits that it has 
sophisticated modern weapons and communications equipment which, 
it explains, were acquired by contributions from civilians. 
  A fifth point notes that this struggle was started because 
throughout 10 years they resorted to every peaceful and legal 
means to solve their problems. The sixth point lists the 
conditions for dialogue. 
  The subversive group also assesses the situation. It states 
that nine <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> members were killed and another 20 were seriously 
wounded. It adds that the enemy casualties, including policemen 
and federal soldiers, amount to 27 dead, 40 wounded, and 180 
prisoners who were already released. It also says that during 
the attacks against four jails, they released 200 inmates. 
  This first <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> official communique was signed with an 
explanation handwritten by subcommander <PERSON>Marcos</PERSON> and states that 
it was issued somewhere in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s southwestern mountains. 
  For its part, the special commission for the dialogue of 
<LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION>' social sectors, which consists of Senator <PERSON>Eduardo 
Robledo Rincon</PERSON>, <PERSON>Heraclio Cepeda</PERSON>, and (Andres Falgas Quic), 
stated that if they are asked to form a negotiating commission 
with the rebel forces, they will be glad to participate. 
  Meanwhile, <PERSON>Senator Robledo Rincon</PERSON> has made the following 
announcement: 
  [Begin <PERSON>Robledo Rincon</PERSON> recording] We have been talking with 
different organizations and parties, and they have expressed 
their concern for their rank and file. We were allowed to 
permit several leaders of these organizations and 
representatives of relatives, as well as government officials, 
to tour parts of the region, especially the <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION> area, so 
that they can establish contacts in the different regions of the 
state. [end recording] 
  [<PERSON>Santoyo</PERSON>] At the same time, the <ORGANIZATION>National Human Rights 
Commission</ORGANIZATION> has reported that members of its delegation, which 
consists of lawyers and doctors, has visited <PERSON>Altamirano</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Chanal</PERSON>, where there had been heavy fighting. They have said 
they went to <LOCATION>San Carlos Hospital</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Santo Domingo Convent</ORGANIZATION>, 
where they have received complaints of alleged violations of 
human rights. Different townspeople have filed the complaints, 
complaints, they said, which are being investigated.

Secretariat</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>SDN</ORGANIZATION>, on 4 <DATE>January</DATE>; place not given; from the "Good 
Afternoon From <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>" newscast] 
  [Text] The clashes between the transgressors of the law and 
<ORGANIZATION>Mexican Army</ORGANIZATION> troops continue. On 3 <DATE>January</DATE> the aggressor groups 
tried several times to recover the city of <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION> by staging 
intermittent attacks which were repelled by the troops. 
  The military personnel are currently -- at 1300 -- receiving 
sporadic fire from snipers in some buildings and on rooftops, 
mainly the Church and the Municipal Presidency. It is known 
that some other groups are still hidden on the outskirts of 
<LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION>. 
  Up to this moment, the number of casualties inflicted on the 
said group amount to 35 dead and an undetermined number of 
wounded. As has already been reported, they evacuate their 
wounded and their corpses when possible. Furthermore, 35 
weapons, 15 grenades, a large amount of ammunition of diverse 
calibers, and knives, as well as silencers, gas masks, and radio 
equipment have been seized. 
  In the military field of the 31st Military Zone, located 10 
km southeast of the city of <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> [De <LOCATION>Las Casas</LOCATION>], the 
military personnel have endured constant harassment from 
isolated shots and have captured, on those occasions, eight 
armed individuals who form part of the aggressor groups. These 
men, including a minor, were immediately delivered to the 
authorities of the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Attorney General's Office</ORGANIZATION>. During 
the night of 2 <DATE>January</DATE>, the aforementioned military 
installation, including the housing areas, received intermittent 
rifle fire from snipers. 
  In <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> [De <LOCATION>Las Casas</LOCATION>], the situation is completely 
calm. 
  Up to this moment and since the beginning of the military 
operations, two officers and five soldiers have died and two 
officers and 14 soldiers have been wounded. On the other hand, 
59 dead have been counted among the members of the transgressor 
groups, and eight of them have been captured. 
  To these [numbers] we have to add the 27 deaths inflicted by 
the aggressor group on the civilian population and the local 
police during the takeover of the four municipal capitals on the 
first day of the year.

  [Text] <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, 11 Feb (AFP) -- 
At a time when <ORGANIZATION>Chiapas State</ORGANIZATION> faces social unrest following the 
seizure of the mayor's offices by the civilian population, the 
<ORGANIZATION>Zapatist National Liberation Army</ORGANIZATION> [<ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>] demanded in a 
communique published on 11 <DATE>February</DATE> that all <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> mayors 
resign or be removed. 
  At the same time, the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>, in another document sent to the 
media, asks journalists to be "patient" regarding the beginning 
of the peace dialogue. Regarding the peace dialogue, the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> 
argues that the delay is due to details over "security for our 
delegates" and not due to "disagreements in the agenda." 
  The <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> believes that "most" <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> mayors "are the 
product 
of electoral fraud, the trampling of the popular will." In this 
document, dated 8 <DATE>February</DATE> and addressed to the Civic Front of 
Mapastepec, the rebels state that "municipal councils chosen 
democratically by the people" should fill the mayor posts that 
are left vacant. 
  In the past days, the civilian population has seized five 
mayors' offices in <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> to demand the dismissal of the 
mayors, who are all members of the ruling <ORGANIZATION>Institutional 
Revolutionary Party</ORGANIZATION>, and whom people accused of mismanagement. 
The offices seized include those in <LOCATION>Cacahoatan</LOCATION>, Huehuetan, 
<LOCATION>Teopisca</LOCATION>, Tuzantan, and <ORGANIZATION>Mapastepec</ORGANIZATION>. According to witnesses, the 
police on 10 <DATE>February</DATE> eliminated the blockade of the Mapastepec 
municipal palace with tear gas and shots, leaving a total of 15 
injured. Before the police intervened, residents partially 
burned the mayor's office in order to protest that their demands 
were not heeded.

<FÊP=106> [Report by <PERSON>Jose Gil Olmos</PERSON> and <PERSON>Elio Henriquez</PERSON>] </F>
  [Excerpt] <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas, <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION>, 16 Jun -- 
<PERSON>Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia</PERSON> has said his role as mediator and the 
role of <ORGANIZATION>Manuel Macho Soils</ORGANIZATION> as peace commissioner concluded with 
the end of the dialogue phase between the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> [<ORGANIZATION>Zapatist 
National Liberation Army</ORGANIZATION>] and the federal government in this 
city. 
  In an interview granted to the media <TIME>this morning</TIME>, <PERSON>Ruiz</PERSON> said 
"the dialogue between the government and the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>, involving the 
commissioner and a mediator, who was accepted as part of the 
dialogue, concluded this phase. Thus, as long as the situation 
remains unchanged, there will no mediation on my part. There is 
no established dialogue between civilian society and the 
government. 
  "After the dialogue was held in <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION>, it was 
declared finished. A reaction followed, and that was 
communicated to the civilian sector, and the dialogue between 
the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> and the government, strictly speaking, ended. "Thus, 
the role of peace commissioner for dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> ended 
with the presentation of direct proposals to the requests and 
demands that were made. Upon an appropriate report, as the one 
I believe we will be presenting in due time, that role ended." 
  [LA JORNADA] Could there be another commissioner? 
  [Ruiz] Yes, because there is now another kind of dialogue 
involved. It is no longer an EZLN-government dialogue but, 
rather, a civilian population-government dialogue, and we will 
have to wait and see how this dialogue is established. 
  Bishop <PERSON>Ruiz</PERSON> said the hierarchy of the <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> will 
not participate in the <ORGANIZATION>National Democratic Convention</ORGANIZATION> (CND), 
called by the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> and which might be held in the <DATE>first half of 
July</DATE> within <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> territory. 
  "We are part of history in the making. If there are concrete 
conditions and the entire civilian sector, which is primarily 
Catholic, agrees with it, we will accompany the country to a 
good goal: the search for a transition to a better fate in 
history. We cannot stay out of this. The Catholic hierarchy 
will not attend the convention unless there is a specific duty 
for it to fulfill." 
  He said that from their very first messages, the bishops 
urged people to understand that the <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> conflict had a 
national scope. In this regard, the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> declaration of war was 
not against a segment of the population, such as the ranchers or 
large landowners, but against the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican Army</ORGANIZATION> because the 
problem in <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> has national scope. 
  During this interview at <ORGANIZATION>Diocese Curia</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Bishop Ruiz</PERSON> said 
that 
after analyzing the most recent <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> communiques, it is clear a 
nonresponse to the peace agreements is not tantamount to a 
declaration of war. 
  To the contrary, he explained, "saying no to the agreements 
is not tantamount to saying yes to war. It is a definite no to 
war; a no to war in favor of a civic and nonmilitary solution; a 
no to war because they unilaterally decided (it is now a 
bilateral decision) to extend the cease-fire; a no to war and a 
yes to the peace option through a dialogue. In this case, 
however, a broader dialogue is being called, a dialogue that 
includes the participation of the entire civilian sector."

  [Text] <PERSON>Tuxtla Gutierrez</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, 2 Jan (AFP) -- An official 
communique issued <DATE>today</DATE> said the government of the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican State 
of Chiapas</ORGANIZATION> "has insisted unsuccessfully on its proposal to hold 
a dialogue" with the <ORGANIZATION>Zapata National Liberation Army</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>), 
which took by storm the mayor's offices in five municipalities. 
  The communique emphasized that the authorities have 
requested 
the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> members, who issued a "Declaration of War" against the 
<ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican Government</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, to "put aside their 
violent and belligerent position against the civilian population 
and the municipal authorities." 
  A day after the sudden attack by several hundred guerrillas 
on the <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> municipalities of <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas, 
<LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Altamirano</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Las Margaritas</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Chanal</PERSON>, the government 
said, it is "concerned about the prevailing atmosphere in the 
municipal county seats," which remained occupied by the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>. 
  At first, authorities indicated that the wave of violence 
had 
been unleashed by 200 Indian peasants, but their most recent 
communique claims that the peasant groups "are infiltrated by 
people with obvious paramilitary training." The communique 
added that the infiltrators have "high-powered weapons, wear 
green pants, khaki shirts, and red and black badges, and present 
themselves as an organization of presumed liberation forces." 
  The communique pointed out that residents of the occupied 
municipalities "have said that some Catholic priests and deacons 
who uphold liberation theology have become involved with these 
groups and are supporting them with the radio communications 
system of the <LOCATION>San Cristobal Diocese</LOCATION>." 
  It noted: "The so-called <PERSON>Emiliano Zapata</PERSON> organization is 
linked to the <ORGANIZATION>Revolutionary Workers Clandestine People's Union 
Party</ORGANIZATION> and to the <ORGANIZATION>Poor People's Party</ORGANIZATION> (guerrillas), and it has 
forced the Ocisingo radio station to broadcast harangues calling 
for violence." 
  The government's communique pointed out that <PERSON>Felipe Arriaga</PERSON>, 
the bishop of <PERSON>Tuxtla Gutierrez</PERSON>, "has urged these groups to put 
aside their violent position and regretted that priests and 
deacons are accused of involvement in these incidents." 
  In <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Cuauhtemoc Cardenas</PERSON>, the presidential 
candidate of the center-leftist Party of the Democratic 
Revolution, said in a news release that "violence, whatever its 
origin, only leads to bloodshed, destruction, and greater social 
backwardness," adding that the government's duty is to inform 
people about the true situation in <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION>. 
  According to <ORGANIZATION>NOTIMEX</ORGANIZATION> -- the official news agency -- 
Government Under Secretary <PERSON>Ricardo Garcia</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican 
Government</ORGANIZATION> is urging peasants in <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> to be reasonable and to 
try to resolve their problems within a legal framework.

using them in their activities. 
  The communique indicated that in towns such as <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> 
de <LOCATION>Las Casas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Altamirano</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> is offering 
medical attention, distributing food, and providing attention to

<FÊP=106> [Report by <PERSON>Raul Rodriguez</PERSON> and <PERSON>Samuel Prieto</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Chiapas State</LOCATION> </F>
from the "Good Morning from <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] [<PERSON>Rodriguez</PERSON>] The place and date for the peace talks 
have not been confirmed yet as some security and logistics 
problems are still pending. It seems, however, the meeting will 
not take place in <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Las Margaritas</LOCATION>, bastions of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Zapatist National Liberation Army</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>. 
  On 6 <DATE>February</DATE>, well-informed sources mentioned two possible 
sites: <LOCATION>Palenque</LOCATION>, located approximately 200 km from <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> 
de las Casas, which has good access roads, or <LOCATION>Comitan</LOCATION>, located 
approximately 80 km from <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas, an area 
with a great degree of <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> influence. 
  In the <DATE>early hours of 6 February</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> communiques were 
received in <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas demanding the 
establishment of security cordons by nongovernmental human 
rights organizations to provide more guarantees. Here is the 
reply given by <PERSON>Gerardo Pacheco</PERSON>, representative of the 
nongovernmental human rights organizations. 
  [<PERSON>Pacheco</PERSON>] We are now in the initial process of reviewing the 
possibilities of establishing security cordons. Right now we are 
trying to adequately interpret the letter addressed to us, after 
which we will decide how we will give the necessary support to 
the proposed security cordons. We are also waiting for reactions 
from nongovernmental human rights organizations in other parts 
of the country, as the letter is addressed to all Mexican 
nongovernmental human rights organizations. In that manner, we 
can organize and coordinate efforts to make possible the 
creation of security cordons providing specific guarantees 
proposed by the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>. 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Prieto] International Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> representative <PERSON>Maria Lude</PERSON> 
explained the <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION>' role in establishing buffer zones in 
areas where the communities are becoming desperate. The creation 
of the so-called buffer zones in the <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> highlands has 
created some confusion among the people regarding the 
<ORGANIZATION>International Red Cross</ORGANIZATION>' role. 
  [Lude] I will take this opportunity to explain the 
<ORGANIZATION>International Red Cross Committee</ORGANIZATION>'s role. As I said, our main 
concern -- and this is how we operate in all countries -- is 
finding out what the main needs are. Our representatives are now 
in the area, evaluating the people's needs, and if necessary 
they will propose ways to provide assistance. At the same time, 
there is a great solidarity movement in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> toward that zone. 
In no way will we prevent Mexicans from helping Mexicans. Our 
role will be limited, as I said, to reopening those areas, after 
which we will let national institutions do the work. I really do 
not think national institutions need our presence to carry out 
their work once the situation returns to normal. 
  In the past, it was confirmed they are efficient 
institutions, and if they really have the necessary assistance, 
we are not the ones to decide if people should or should not 
receive assistance by the Mexican people. What we will do is to 
work based on the people's needs, which is our policy. Once the 
zone is reopened, organizations willing to help can take over. 
  [<PERSON>Prieto</PERSON>] The entry of the <ORGANIZATION>International Red Cross Committee</ORGANIZATION> 
in the buffer zones does not mean all nutritional and medical 
problems will be resolved. 
  [<PERSON>Rodriguez</PERSON>] <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, 6 <DATE>February</DATE> was a normal day in <LOCATION>San 
Cristobal</LOCATION> and nearby communities. Apparently, everything was 
calm in the <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> highlands.

  [Text] <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas, 29 Jan (EFE) -- <PERSON>Manuel 
Camacho Solis</PERSON>, government commissioner for peace and 
reconciliation, today revealed seven points proposed by the 
government to start a peace dialogue with the rebel <ORGANIZATION>Zapatista 
National Liberation Army</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>). The government, <PERSON>Camacho Solis</PERSON> 
said, accepted the agenda proposed by the rebels that consists 
of seven points: economic demands, social demands, political 
demands, democratic progress, an end to the hostilities, an end 
to violent confrontations, and the establishment of guarantees 
for the two parties. 
  At a news conference in the colonial city of <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> 
de 
las Casas, about 750 km southeast of the Mexican capital, 
<PERSON>Camacho Solis</PERSON> pointed out that the conditions for peace are 
present, but he added that it is not known whether negotiations 
with the rebels will start soon. The commissioner admitted that 
the Indians are facing "serious living conditions" besides 
racism and isolation and promised to open "legal opportunities 
for the participation" of the armed rebels in society. 
  To end the hostilities, the commissioner proposed 
"negotiation, agreements, declaration of a definitive end to the 
hostilities, disarmament with guarantees for the two parties, 
reconciliation, and return to work and open participation in 
political life by the rebels." The commissioner said that "only 
facts will create new conditions and added that they (the 
rebels) must define their positions and be consistent with 
them." <PERSON>Camacho Solis</PERSON> said that the nation is headed for 
political change and added that the 21 <DATE>August</DATE> presidential 
election will be held in peace. 
  "We either settle the problem in <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> correctly, 
promptly, 
seriously, and honestly, or a conflict bringing only 
destruction, greater poverty, and isolation will take root," he 
added. The commissioner pointed out that "there are no 
middle-of-the-road points here; we either attain peace or 
<LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> will not achieve economic modernization and social 
tranquillity. We need to reach peace through democracy and 
determination." 
  Although <PERSON>Bishop Samuel Ruiz</PERSON>, official mediator of the 
conflict between the government and the rebels, announced that 
<PERSON>Camacho Solis</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> command would meet "very soon," the 
commissioner said he does not know when this meeting will take 
place or "if it will take place at all." He added that the peace 
negotiations should establish an agile mechanism to apply the 
recently created Amnesty Law for freeing the rest of the 
hostages and prisoners, reach agreements on the sentences that 
are applicable to the Indians who participated in other social 
struggles, and establish ways to apply the pardon. 
  <PERSON>Camacho Solis</PERSON> said that he sent a note to the rebels on the 
points that were complied with for the release of former <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> 
Governor <PERSON>Absalon Castellanos</PERSON>, who the insurgents want to 
exchange for jailed <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> members. Finally, <PERSON>Camacho Solis</PERSON> asked 
the media in <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas to choose a group of 15 
reporters from the most representative media to cover a possible 
meeting. 
  In the past days <PERSON>Camacho Solis</PERSON> exchanged numerous 
communiques 
with the rebels in an attempt to start peace negotiations as 
soon as possible. The population is awaiting these negotiations 
"with anxiety," the local media reported. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> rebelled against the government on 1 <DATE>January</DATE> in the 
State of <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> and clashed with the armed forces during the 
first 10 days of the conflict. This produced an official toll 
of 108 dead and thousands displaced.

  [Text] <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, 3 Jan (AFP) -- 
According to various sources, the <ORGANIZATION>Zapata National Liberation 
Army</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>) is maintaining a guerrilla presence today in at 
least five towns of the southern State of <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION>, leaving four 
mayors offices violently occupied in the past few days. 
  <PERSON>Rafael Gonzalez Lastra</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Chiapas Government</ORGANIZATION> secretary 
general, has told a news conference that the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> "aggressors" 
left the mayors offices in <LOCATION>Las Margaritas</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Chanal</PERSON> today and 
that <ORGANIZATION>Mexican Army</ORGANIZATION> troops are in the city of <LOCATION>Comitan</LOCATION>, south of 
<LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION>, to guarantee peace. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> forces violently seized the mayors offices in <LOCATION>San 
Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas, <LOCATION>Las Margaritas</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Chanal</PERSON>, <PERSON>Altamirano</PERSON>, and 
<LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION> on 1 <DATE>January</DATE> in what constituted a violent guerrilla 
outbreak. 
  The guerrillas left <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> on 2 <DATE>January</DATE> and moved 
toward <ORGANIZATION>Rancho Nuevo</ORGANIZATION>, where they have sustained several clashes 
with the troops stationed at the <ORGANIZATION>31st Military Zone Garrison</ORGANIZATION>. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> presence continues in <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION>, where there have 
been clashes, and <PERSON>Altamirano</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Oxchuch</LOCATION>, Huiztan, and Cuxulja, 
which they occupied on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. 
  Certain reports stated that a group of rebels has taken over 
<LOCATION>Guadalupe Tepeyac</LOCATION>, in <ORGANIZATION>Las Margaritas Municipality</ORGANIZATION>. 
  <PERSON>Gonzalez Lastra</PERSON> said he trusts that order will be 
reestablished in <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Altamirano</PERSON> "within the next few 
hours." 
  Media reports, which authorities have not confirmed, state 
that the troops arrested 12 civilians in <LOCATION>Comitan</LOCATION>. Near the city 
an <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> unit kidnapped former <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> Governor <PERSON>Absalon 
Castellanos</PERSON> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. His whereabouts are unknown.

<FÊP=106> [Report by <PERSON>Juan Carlos Santoyos</PERSON> from <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las </F>
Casas, <ORGANIZATION>Chiapas State</ORGANIZATION>, for the "Panorama Newscast" -- live] 
  [Excerpts] The situtation here in <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las 
Casas, <ORGANIZATION>Chiapas State</ORGANIZATION>, remains tense even though soldiers have 
been deployed here in the main square. This is the situation: 
There are problems getting food. Stores are closed in some 
areas. Hotels are serving food only to their guests, and it is 
just one kind of meal, nothing else. Local drugstores are 
finding it difficult to obtain medical supplies as members of 
the <ORGANIZATION>Zapata National Liberation Army</ORGANIZATION> [<ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>] looted the stores 
when they arrived. Thus there are no medical supplies for a 
medical emergency. It is also worth noting that the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican 
Army</ORGANIZATION> has resumed reconnaissance and surveillance flights all 
over the city. Starting at approximately <DATE>0700</DATE> when the weather 
allowed because the fog lifted a little, <ORGANIZATION>Mexican Army</ORGANIZATION> 
helicopters have been flying over <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas and 
the area 7 km away, where the 31st Military Zone is stationed. 
  I must also state that local residents are afraid the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> 
members will resume their activities near the city. Up until 
<DATE>0200</DATE> we could hear heavy caliber weapons, chiefly howitzers and 
cannons, firing at rebel objectives. Early <TIME>this morning</TIME> I had 
the opportunity to inspect the city. It was almost deserted. 
Fear prevails as the ringing of heavy caliber weapons has been 
heard since early in the <TIME>morning</TIME> from both far and near. Many 
tourists have been stranded here because gas stations are not 
observing regular business hours as they fear gasoline may be 
rationed. Why is that? Because so far, <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION> [Mexican 
Petroleum] trucks have not come to supply the city's three gas 
stations. [passage omitted] Stores and schools are closed in 
this city. The only thing we see is that a few people are 
coming down from the mountain range to try to sell their 
products here. In <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION> and mainly on the <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de 
las <PERSON>Casas</PERSON> - <ORGANIZATION>Ocosingo Highway</ORGANIZATION>, a distance of approximately 117 
kilometers, military roadblocks are still up to keep people from 
entering due to the fierce clashes taking place in the mountain 
range, as we were told. Stores, public offices, and houses were 
looted in <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION> as well. A report states that 15 policemen 
were killed in a clash with the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> members. Four members of 
the <PERSON>Solorzano</PERSON> family were kidnapped. They are local ranchers. 
  We can also report that in (Chiompla) Municipality a young 
woman was brutally beaten and raped for refusing to give food to 
the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> members. The state government reported that the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> 
is in <LOCATION>Las Margaritas</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Altamirano</PERSON>, although there is no word 
yet as to whether the soldiers have been able to enter these 
municipalities. The fighting continues. It was also reported 
from (Chiompla) that a stronger military operation w??l be 
conducted, although the time has not been announced. That is 
what is happening now in <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas and on the 
highway to <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION>.

<FÊP=106> [Report by <PERSON>Jose Torres Hernandez</PERSON>] </F>
  [Excerpt] <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas (<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>), 13 Feb (EFE) 
-- The Armed Forces have discreetly intensified military 
surveillance in the conflict zone in <LOCATION>Chiapas State</LOCATION> in the 
southeastern part of <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. At the same time, the <ORGANIZATION>Zapatist 
National Liberation Army</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>) is continuing its diplomatic 
offensive by forwarding letters to various social organizations. 
  The community of <PERSON>Altamirano</PERSON>, 850 km southeast of <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION> 
and one of the four communities attacked by the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> in the wake 
of its 1 <DATE>January</DATE> offensive, remains virtually occupied by the 
<ORGANIZATION>Armed Forces</ORGANIZATION>. Cording to an official communique, however, the 
<ORGANIZATION>Armed Forces</ORGANIZATION> intend to simply maintain a garrison at the 
entrance of the community. Most people in <PERSON>Altamirano</PERSON> who do not 
have to work remain indoors most of the time and prefer to keep 
their opinions on the conflict to themselves. During a brief 
tour of the community, soldiers supported by jeeps and tanks 
could be seen on every street. Also, heightened security 
measures are in effect in the nearby mountainous area where it 
is believed the Zapatist presence is the strongest. 
  Since the conflict began, the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican Army</ORGANIZATION> has maintained 
some 17,000 soldiers at its primary base in <LOCATION>Rancho Nuevo</LOCATION>, 10 km 
southeast of <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas. As of 15 <DATE>January</DATE> when 
a truce was declared, the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> gradually started to withdraw 
from the towns of <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Las Margaritas</LOCATION>, 
and it has set up checkpoints at the entrance of each of these 
communities. 
  Yesterday, the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> increased the number of troops at the 
fork in the road leading to <ORGANIZATION>Ranch Nuevo</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION>. Ocosingo 
is an access point into the <LOCATION>Lacandona</LOCATION> jungle, which is a 
Zapatist stronghold. 
  Meanwhile, <PERSON>Manuel Camacho Solis</PERSON>, commissioner for peace and 
national reconciliation; <PERSON>Samuel Ruiz</PERSON>, bishop of <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de 
las Casas; and more than 300 journalists are still awaiting a 
possible meeting with the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>. The meeting was postponed 
several times over the past week. 
  In his <DATE>Sunday</DATE> homily today, Bishop <PERSON>Samuel Ruiz</PERSON> reiterated 
that famine is the most serious problem facing the <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> 
Indians who, according to official figures, total 1 million. 
  While waiting for the meeting between the Zapatists and the 
government to take place, <PERSON>Camacho Solis</PERSON> is maintaining contact 
with the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> by way of confidential letters. Meanwhile, the 
<ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> also is sending messages to other intermediators. The 
meeting between the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> and the government is expected to take 
place in a <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> community which has yet to be determined.

<LEADPARA>  The nation's minority population is becoming increasingly diverse, with a
range of new Asian and Hispanic subgroups growing rapidly and dispersing
across the continent, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday.;    While Chinese,
Filipinos and Japanese still rank as the largest Asian groups, Southeast
Asians, Indians, Koreans and smaller populations of Pakistanis and

<TEXT>     In <LOCATION>Santa Clara County</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, the growth in the Vietnamese
population outstripped the growth rates of other Asian groups. The number of
Vietnamese jumped <PERCENT>359 percent</PERCENT> in the area, and 212 percent statewide, bringing
the total Vietnamese population in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> to 280,223 people.;    Among
Hispanics, growth in the predominant groups of Mexicans, <LOCATION>Puerto Ricans</LOCATION> and
Cubans was outpaced by those identified as "other Hispanic," mostly Central
and South American populations including Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Colombians
and Hondurans.;    Together, the figures from the <DATE>1990</DATE> census provide a more
detailed profile of an increasingly multicultural society, with virtually
every corner of the nation drawing Asians and Hispanics from a range of
different national backgrounds.;    Most of the extraordinary growth among
Asians and Hispanics is because of immigration.;    "In addition to having all
the various European groups, we have superimposed on that Asian ethnic groups
and Latin American ethnic groups," said <PERSON>Jeffrey Passel</PERSON>, a demographer at the
Urban Institute.;    While earlier census figures reflected rapid growth among
Asians, <LOCATION>Pacific Islanders</LOCATION> and Hispanics relative to the white and black
populations, these were the first figures to break out the various rates of
increase among those ethnic subpopulations.;    The number of those
identifying themselves as Asian or <LOCATION>Pacific Islander</LOCATION> grew by <PERCENT>108 percent</PERCENT> to
nearly 7.3 million, with Chinese making up the largest subgroup at <MONEY>1.6
million</MONEY>, growing <PERCENT>104 percent</PERCENT> over the decade. But among the smaller
populations, there was much faster growth. The nation's Hmong population, for
example, increased 1,600 percent.;    Hispanics as a group grew by <PERCENT>53 percent</PERCENT>
to 22.4 million, with Mexicans growing by <PERCENT>54 percent</PERCENT> to 13.5 million. "Other
Hispanics" grew by nearly <PERCENT>67 percent</PERCENT> to about 5 million.  </TEXT>

<FÊP=106> [Report by <PERSON>Rosi Ahuatxil</PERSON>] </F>
  [Text] <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> Governor (<PERSON>Elmar Checher</PERSON>) has requested the 
protection of the powers of the union and the intervention of 
the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican Army</ORGANIZATION> to settle once and for all the violence 
prevailing in the State of <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> and, of course, to prevent 
more bloodshed. 
  (Checher) has said that the government's concern has been to 
make the civilian population a priority, and this is why the 
national <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> had not intervened earlier as the subversives were 
occupying <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas. 
  He urged the people to act prudently to avoid being 
controlled by panic and rumors and to facilitate the work of the 
national <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> to reinforce the protection and security of the 
affected towns. 
  (Checher) has said that government efforts to establish a 
dialogue have not been well received, and this shall be 
construed as defiance and contempt toward the institutions; 
this, he added, has changed his attitude on the actions that 
should be adopted to immediately restore order, peace, and 
tranquility, which have always prevailed in the <LOCATION>State of Chiapas</LOCATION>. 
  Thus, the governor has urged the population to remain calm. 
He said that with the government's leadership, <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> society 
will continue to improve its standard of living with strength, 
firmness, and enthusiasm, and with the dignity of a people who 
know where they are headed, because they have a well-defined 
course and fate. 
  This was the message of encouragement issued by the governor 
of <ORGANIZATION>Chiapas State</ORGANIZATION> to his people.

  [Text] <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, 17 Jan (AFP) -- 
The Mexican Government "is using the economic and military aid" 
that it receives from the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to "massacre the Chiapas 
Indians," the <ORGANIZATION>Zapatist National Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION> [<ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>] rebels 
charged in a message addressed on 13 <DATE>January</DATE> to President <PERSON>Bill 
Clinton</PERSON>. The letter was published today by the local newspaper 
<ORGANIZATION>EL TIEMPO</ORGANIZATION>. 
  Signed by <PERSON>Subcommander Marcos</PERSON>, who explained that there will 
be a delay in delivery with the package of documents issued from 
7 to 13 <DATE>January</DATE>--the texts of which referred to the 
cease-fire--to Peace Commissioner <PERSON>Manuel Camacho</PERSON>, they reject 
any charges that they attacked "civilian objectives," among 
other things. 
  In an 11 <DATE>January</DATE> text, the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> stated "it does not know 
<PERSON>Camacho Solis</PERSON>, but if this gentleman truly and honestly wants to 
find a political and fair solution, we hail his appointment as 
peace commissioner and we reiterate to him our willingness to 
dialogue." 
  Camacho stated on <DATE>Monday</DATE> that he received a new message from 
the <LOCATION>Zapatistas</LOCATION>, which is why he went to the capital to brief 
<PERSON>Carlos Salinas</PERSON> on, with the certainty that there would be a 
response for them by 18 <DATE>January</DATE>. 
  Salinas announced on 16 <DATE>January</DATE> that he will send to 
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> 
"a draft law granting general amnesty" to <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> members who 
rebelled in <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> 15 days ago. This was considered by 
political and social sectors as a new step toward peace. 
  In a 6 <DATE>January</DATE> communique, the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> requested, among other 
things for dialogue, its recognition as a belligerent force, a 
cease-fire, the withdrawal of government troops from <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION>, 
and democratic and social benefits. 
  In the message to <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Congress</ORGANIZATION> and people, the 
<ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> asked if they "approved this military and economic aid to 
combat narcotrafficking and to kill Indians in the southeastern 
part of <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>." 
  "Troops, aircraft, helicopters, radar and communications 
equipment, firearms, and military weapons are now used not 
against narcotraffickers and the big drug lords of the drug 
mafias, but to repress the just struggles of the people of 
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>," it added. 
  The Zapatists claim "we have nothing to do with 
narcotrafficking or national or international terrorism," and 
they say that "with the support the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Government</ORGANIZATION> and people 
offer to the federal government they are only staining their 
hands with the blood of Indians." 
  "Do not stain your hands with our blood, becoming an 
accomplice of the Mexican Government," because "our wish is for 
all the peoples of the world: true liberty and democracy," the 
message to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> president concluded. 
  In a 13 <DATE>January</DATE> communique, the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> said that "no way will 
we turn over our weapons or surrender our forces to the evil 
government. The cease-fire is aimed at alleviating the 
situation of the civilian population in the combat zone and 
paves the way for dialogue with all the progressive and 
democratic sectors of <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>."

de las Casas on 1 <DATE>January</DATE> -- published in LA JORNADA newspaper 
of <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION> -- passages in italics are <PERSON>Gutierrez</PERSON>' 
commentaries] 
  [Text]1 <DATE>January</DATE>, <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas, <DATE>1930</DATE> 
hours. I walked toward the main entrance of <ORGANIZATION>City Hall</ORGANIZATION>, which 
was occupied by members of the self-styled <ORGANIZATION>Zapatista National 
Liberation Army</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>). I asked to speak with Commander <PERSON>Marcos</PERSON>. 
An Indian carrying a gun told me to go in. I climbed to the 
second floor. Everything is destroyed; only the lamps hung 
intact from the ceiling. 
  [<PERSON>Gutierrez</PERSON>] Commander, your troops, the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>, seem a bit too 
weak to march into <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION> and overthrow <PERSON>Salinas</PERSON>. Is your 
attitude a bit naive? 
  [Commander <PERSON>Marcos</PERSON>] Look, if you are waiting for our arrival 
in the capital, it will take some time. he chuckles 
But seriously, I can tell you that what you see here in <LOCATION>San 
Cristobal</LOCATION> is only a very small portion of our troops; many of 
our men would never be recognized because they wear clothes from 
the mountains, where there are many more Zapatistas than you or 
the government can imagine. Beside, we do not expect to arrive 
in the capital with our men alone but with many more who will 
join us along the way. 
  [<PERSON>Gutierrez</PERSON>] Your weapons are much less powerful than the 
<ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>'s. Is that a great disadvantage? 
  [Commander <PERSON>Marcos</PERSON>] Our weapons are the people and we know 
the 
mountains better than anyone. 
  [<PERSON>Gutierrez</PERSON>] Where were you born? 
  [Commander <PERSON>Marcos</PERSON>] I can tell you I am a Mexican, like all 
the struggling members of the <ORGANIZATION>Zapatista Army</ORGANIZATION>. I am not from 
<LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION>, however. 
  [<PERSON>Gutierrez</PERSON>] Where did you receive your military training? 
  [Commander <PERSON>Marcos</PERSON>] I can tell you I have military training 
but nothing else. I know the difference between fighting in the 
city, in the countryside, in the flat lands, in the mountains, 
in the jungle, and in the desert. 
  A colleague of Commander <PERSON>Marcos</PERSON> addresses him and they talk 
for a few minutes. I look around. I see <ORGANIZATION>Chiapas Indians</ORGANIZATION>, armed 
with really old guns except for some 19 or 20 of them who carry 
better weapons. I take the opportunity to ask one of them about 
the reasons and risks of this uprising, and the only reply I 
received was: "We have been shafted, we are hungry, but we are 
fighting. We have no home or medicines, but we are fighting." 
  I return to Commander <PERSON>Marcos</PERSON> who just learned that the 
uprising was reported on television. He stares at me and says: 
"Let's see if those sons of bitches continue to deny the 
existence of guerrillas in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>." 
  [<PERSON>Gutierrez</PERSON>] Have you anything to do with Liberation 
Theology? 
  [Commander <PERSON>Marcos</PERSON>] No, we have become liberated without any 
theology. he laughs Among our people we have 
evangelists, Catholics, atheists, sorcerers, etc. I am not 
joking about the sorcerers. There are sorcerers from <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION>. 
  Marcos seems well instructed and very sure of his 
statements. He jokes around as if his life were not in serious 
danger 
  [<PERSON>Gutierrez</PERSON>] Does the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> want new elections after a 
transition government? 
  [Commander <PERSON>Marcos</PERSON>] We are demanding real elections for the 
first time in many years. What we now have, what they are 
planning for <ORGANIZATION>Colosio</ORGANIZATION> is just a masquerade. We all know that the 
votes do not count and that everything follows the whim of 
(<PERSON>Carlos</PERSON>) <PERSON>Salinas</PERSON>, who is a usurper and a traitor. We demand 
real elections with a chance for all parties, not just for the 
<ORGANIZATION>PRI</ORGANIZATION> [<ORGANIZATION>Institutional Revolutionary Party</ORGANIZATION>]. 
  [<PERSON>Gutierrez</PERSON>] Everything seems to indicate that the 
inhabitants 
of <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> are not in the least happy with your attack on 
this city. Everyone on the street is making comments like, 
violence doesn't lead anywhere and other similar things. Are 
you not worried about this repudiation by the people? 
  [Commander <PERSON>Marcos</PERSON>] Of course I would prefer things to be 
different. But I want to clarify that <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION>'s residents 
and the non-Indian population are racists. If one of them 
boards a bus and an Indian is seated, they make him stand to 
allow the other person to sit. If an Indian is coming down the 
street, either walking or on his bicycle, they will drive their 
cars dangerously close, threatening the Indian. If those kind 
of people condemn the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>, you can imagine that I do not care 
in the least. 
  "As for the issue that violence doesn't lead anywhere, I can 
answer you that we have adopted this extreme position because of 
the institutional violence that causes us to die of cholera, 
malaria, or measles; which allows the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> to permanently 
violate human rights; and which allows hunger and misery to 
prevail in the country, all because of Salinas. We do not even 
want to become the government. We only want a democratically 
elected government and respect for ethnic groups. 
  Another thing I would like to clarify is that I am not the 
leader of the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>. We do not have a leader; we have a 
committee. I am only in charge of the operation in <LOCATION>San 
Cristobal</LOCATION>." [quotation marks as published]

  [Text] <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas (<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>), 6 Jan (DPA) -- 
The Mexican Armed Forces today attacked with mortars rebel 
positions in the mountains which surround the city of <LOCATION>San 
Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas, in southern <LOCATION>Chiapas State</LOCATION>. 
  The Mexican <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>'s attack was launched from the region of 
<LOCATION>Maria Auxiliadora</LOCATION> hill, approximately 8 km southeast of <LOCATION>San 
Cristobal de las Casas</LOCATION>, where clashes between the Armed Forces 
and rebels of the <ORGANIZATION>Zapatista National Liberation Army</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>) have 
concentrated. 
  The new military operation in the zone, which began shortly 
after 0700 local (1300 GMT), was confirmed by residents to 
Mexican and foreign journalists who traveled to the area despite 
the defense ministry's recommendations to the media yesterday -- 
to abstain from entering the combat zone, for security reasons. 
  Six Mexican journalists were almost killed yesterday when 
machinegun fire from <ORGANIZATION>Mexican Air Force</ORGANIZATION> aircraft hit near the 
station wagon in which they traveled toward <ORGANIZATION>Maria Auxiliadora</ORGANIZATION> 
hill. 
  There is still no information if the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>'s bombardments and 
machinegun fire in the region have resulted in casualties. 
However, <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las <PERSON>Casas Bishop Samuel Ruiz</PERSON> said he 
had received information about the disappearance of various 
Indians who live in the zone. 
  Clashes in the mountain zone south of <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las 
Casas began on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, when fighter airplanes launched the 
first attack on Maria Auxiliadora hill to evict groups of rebels 
that withdrew to the mountain after leaving various towns they 
seized on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.

  [Text] <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas (<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>), 10 Jan (EFE) -- 
The Mexican Armed Forces are preparing a large offensive against 
the <ORGANIZATION>Zapatista National Liberation Army</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>) in <LOCATION>Chiapas State</LOCATION> 
and have moved approximately 15,000 soldiers, 40 tanks, planes, 
helicopters, and paratroopers to that southern area. The "final 
offensive" to be launched by the military this week will have 
the town of <LOCATION>Guadalupe Tepeyac</LOCATION> -- the only one still under rebel 
control -- as its main objective, the Mexican media asserted 
today, <DATE>Monday</DATE>. 
  Several Social Security employees have indicated that 
approximately 200 rebels are holding approximately 100 <ORGANIZATION>Guadalupe 
Tepeyac Hospital</ORGANIZATION> physicians and nurses hostage at those 
installations. The hospital is 800 meters from the Guatemalan 
border. 
  Unofficial reports also indicate that former <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> 
Governor 
General <PERSON>Absalon Castellanos</PERSON> could also be held in <LOCATION>Guadalupe 
Tepeyac</LOCATION>. Castellanos was kidnapped by the rebels a day after the 
conflict began, and the rebels announced that they intended to 
subject him to a summary trial. 
  None of the reporters assigned to the area or the residents 
of the cities negatively affected by the conflict have been able 
to confirm reports on the Armed Forces offensive because the 
roads that lead to the area have been closed by the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican Army</ORGANIZATION>. 
  There continues to be an important movement of troops at the 
colonial city of <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas, the entrances to 
which are guarded by tanks, and according to the media, large 
numbers of soldiers are constantly arriving. Military 
checkpoints in the <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> jungle and mountain regions have also 
been reinforced. Not even the civilians who want to take 
potable water, medicine, and food to relatives trapped in the 
conflict area are allowed to pass. Local radio stations are 
constantly broadcasting messages requesting help for the 
besieged residents or reports that they are well so relatives in 
other regions can be at ease. 
  On 1 <DATE>January</DATE> the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> took up arms against the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican 
Government</ORGANIZATION>, declared war on the <ORGANIZATION>Armed Forces</ORGANIZATION>, and seized several 
communities. Since then the confrontations have not stopped, 
and according to unofficial reports, at least 200 are dead and 
1,000 injured. 
  In its counteroffensive, the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican Army</ORGANIZATION> managed to push 
the 
rebels to the mountainous area surrounding <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las 
Casas and is currently searching for the guerrilla's general 
headquarters, which is hidden in <LOCATION>Lacandona</LOCATION> jungle. 
  The last reported clash took place at the <ORGANIZATION>31st Military Zone</ORGANIZATION> 
garrison in <LOCATION>Rancho Nuevo</LOCATION>, 10 km from <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION>, yesterday, 
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>. The <ORGANIZATION>National Defense Secretariat</ORGANIZATION> has not reported 
casualties on either side. 
  On that same day the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> arrested Mexican priest <PERSON>Isidro 
Guillermo Badillo Brana</PERSON> at the border between <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Tabasco States</LOCATION>. He is charged with commanding a group of rebels 
and was transferred to the military installations in <LOCATION>San 
Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas. The local church has demanded the 
parish priest's immediate dismissal and announced that if it is 
not done the church will ask for intervention by the <ORGANIZATION>National 
Human Rights Commission</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>CNDH</ORGANIZATION>.) 
  According to the <ORGANIZATION>National Defense Secretariat</ORGANIZATION>, the 106 
rebels 
who have been arrested revealed important information regarding 
the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>'s organization, its ties with Central American rebel 
groups, and the orientation of its leaders. The <ORGANIZATION>Attorney 
General's Office</ORGANIZATION> reported in a communique that according to the 
rebels' testimony, at least two of the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> leaders are 
Guatemalans -- Commanders <PERSON>Marcos</PERSON> and Jesus -- and it is they 
who headed the takeover of <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>Judicial Police</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> have begun to search for 
both leaders, who apparently participated in the <ORGANIZATION>Rancho Nuevo</ORGANIZATION> 
clash at the beginning of the hostilities when five soldiers 
were killed.

  [Text] <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas (<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>), 4 Jan (DPA) -- 
The Mexican "zapatist" guerrillas who spectacularly began a 
conflict in the southern State of <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> on 1 <DATE>January</DATE> plan a 
long-term war to "exterminate capitalism and institute 
socialism." 
  "We do not just want a change of government, we want to 
exterminate the capitalist system and establish socialism as 
many other countries have. We will not lay down our weapons for 
any reason," said one of the commanders near the occupied area 
of <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Altamirano</PERSON>. 
  The so-called "Zapatist National Liberation Army (<ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>)," 
which took its name from the legendary peasant guerrilla leader 
<PERSON>Emiliano Zapata</PERSON> of the armed revolution of 1910-17, began on 1 
<DATE>January</DATE> by occupying four important municipal capitals of 
<ORGANIZATION>Chiapas State</ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s poorest and most underdeveloped 
states. "We had waited many years for solutions to our 
problems, many years of poverty and ignorance, and that is why 
we decided to go to war," said the rebel commander who 
identified himself simply as "Captain" of the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION>, during a 
conversation with journalists at one of the rebel road blocks on 
the San Cristobal-Ocosingo road. 
  The insurgents first occupied <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas, 
<LOCATION>Las 
Margaritas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Altamirano</PERSON>, but later left the first 
two towns and fell back to the mountains of the so-called 
chiapan highlands [altos chiapanecos], near the border with 
<LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION>. The first clashes have left an unofficial tally of 
100 dead and several dozen wounded. Even though when they left 
<LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> De Las Casas they attacked an <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> garrison near 
the town, their initial tactic seemed to be to fall back from 
the occupied areas without offering resistance to the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> in 
order to strike other points in the region. 
  Another rebel commander, who identified himself with his nom 
de guerre, "Lieutenant [teniente] Jesus," said that "the armed 
struggle is the only path for changing the situation of 
oppression and marginalization in which the indigenous persons 
and peasants have been kept for 500 years." "For the poor, all 
the legal paths have been closed for years," added "Lieutenant 
Jesus, "a young man of 18 years of age who was in command of a 
roadblock approximately 25 km from <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION>. 
  The insurgent group, whose existence was reported -- and 
officially denied -- <DATE>last May</DATE>, has apparently existed for 
several years. "On 1 <DATE>January</DATE> the war started, we declared war 
on the enemy, but our organization had existed for many years," 
said the guerrilla "Captain." "At first there were the 
guerrillas that only operated in the mountains, later it grew 
and extended its field of operation. Peasants, teachers, and 
workers joined the movement and that is how we formed the 
<ORGANIZATION>Zapatist National Liberation Army</ORGANIZATION>," he said. Now -- he added -- 
"we are structured like an army, we have military ranks, as the 
federal <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> does, but we are different, we are an army of the 
people, not of the bourgeoisie." 
  Witnesses said at lease 500 guerrillas participated in the 
occupation of the four towns. They were armed with rifles, 
handguns, knives, machetes, and automatic weapons such as 
AK-47's and Mini-14s. Wearing military uniforms and with their 
faces covered with ski caps or red handkerchiefs, they still 
occupied on <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> the towns of <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Altamirano</PERSON>, 
less than 100 km east of <LOCATION>San Cristobal</LOCATION> de las Casas. At Least 
four roadblocks, placed by the rebels on the road, block the 
access routes to <LOCATION>Ocosingo</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Altamirano</PERSON>. 
  "Lieutenant Jesus" said the <ORGANIZATION>EZLN</ORGANIZATION> is prepared for a long war. 
"We will accept many casualties, but will never surrender our 
weapons. We will continue the revolution until we win it with 
the weapons in our hands. That is our objective," he stressed.
