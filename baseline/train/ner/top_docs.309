   Museum curators, history buffs and urban
cowboys bought up the biggest collection of <PERSON>William F.</PERSON> ``Buffalo
Bill'' Cody memorabilia ever auctioned <DATE>Friday</DATE>, including a
silver-trimmed rifle that brought <MONEY>$22,500</MONEY>.
   The collection, sold at <ORGANIZATION>Butterfield &amp; Butterfield</ORGANIZATION>, consisted of
more than 300 items originally preserved by <ORGANIZATION>Cody</ORGANIZATION>'s sister, <PERSON>Julia
Cody Goodman</PERSON>.
   A pair of chaps worn by the <ORGANIZATION>Pony Express</ORGANIZATION> rider, Indian fighter,
buffalo hunter, <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> scout and showman sold for <MONEY>$1,400</MONEY>, and a rope
lariat went for <MONEY>$500</MONEY>.
   A silver-handled Plains rifle fetched <MONEY>$22,500</MONEY>. Other items
included <PERSON>Cody</PERSON>'s buffalo-hide coat and his silver-handled toothbrush.
   ``Who better symbolizes the American West than Buffalo Bill?''
asked <PERSON>R.L. Wilson</PERSON>, historical consultant to <ORGANIZATION>Colt Firearms Co.</ORGANIZATION> of
<LOCATION>Hartford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn</LOCATION>. He came to bid on a single-action Colt revolver,
one of eight guns in the collection.
   The collection was sold by <PERSON>Greg Martin</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> gun
collector and history buff who bought the artifacts for <MONEY>$300,000</MONEY>
last year in <LOCATION>Billings</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mont</LOCATION>. He had wanted to buy only a shotgun
inscribed to <ORGANIZATION>Cody</ORGANIZATION>, but had to buy the whole lot to get the shotgun
from the elderly owner.
   Rival bidders eyeing each other across the auction floor
included curator <PERSON>Paul Fees</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Buffalo Bill Museum</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Cody</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Wyo.</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Thomas B. Morrison</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Buffalo Bill Ranch Historic
Park</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>North Platte</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Neb</LOCATION>.
   They vied for a collection of letters to <ORGANIZATION>Cody</ORGANIZATION>'s sister
discussing his marriage, the death of his son and other intimate
events.
   ``We are interested in the correspondence because it is so
revealing and personal,'' said Fees. ``We have a strong
biographical interest.''
   The collection was unique for its large number of personal
items, including a tomahawk from his friend D.F. ``White Beaver''
<PERSON>Powell</PERSON> and dozens of photographs, show bills and theater tickets
chronicling Cody's life as the roughrider who along with shooting
champion W. ``Doc'' <PERSON>Carver</PERSON> founded the first Wild West Show.
   <PERSON>Carl Otis</PERSON>, owner of Pawnee Bill's Wild West Exposition
Re-enacted, a <LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION> traveling show, dressed in white
Stetson hat and buckskin jacket for the occasion. He bid <MONEY>$3,000</MONEY> on
a <ORGANIZATION>Smith &amp; Wesson</ORGANIZATION> ivory-handled revolver used in Cody's Wild West
Show but the gun went for <MONEY>$9,000</MONEY>.
   Private collector <PERSON>George Kramer</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> real estate
developer, hoped to buy Cody's silver riding bit for his
80-year-old father, who still rides. But he bid first on <ORGANIZATION>Cody</ORGANIZATION>'s
Winchester rifle, inscribed and hand-carved with buffalo.
   ``That's the one item I wanted most,'' said <PERSON>Kramer</PERSON>, who
successfully bid <MONEY>$11,000</MONEY> for it.

   Buffalo <PERSON>Bill</PERSON>'s buffalo-hide coat, eight
guns and a tomahawk go on the auction block today in the largest
sale yet of Wild West memorabilia collected by the legendary
<PERSON>William F. Cody</PERSON>.
   The 300 items offered for sale belong to <LOCATION>San</LOCATION> Franciscan <PERSON>Greg
Martin</PERSON>, who acquired the collection after he had been unable to buy
the single item he wanted.
   It was a double-barrel shotgun that brought <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> to a
warehouse in <LOCATION>Billings</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mont.</LOCATION>, last year.
   ``I saw it up in storage ... and my pulse skipped a beat,'' said
<PERSON>Martin</PERSON>, who offered to buy the Westley-Richards English shotgun
inscribed to Cody.
   When the elderly owner refused to sell just one item, <PERSON>Martin</PERSON>
wrote a check for <MONEY>$300,000</MONEY> for the entire collection and took it
out of storage for the first time in 20 years.
   ``He is the living symbol of the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> and one of the most famous
Americans who ever lived,'' said <PERSON>Martin</PERSON>, 49, a gun collector and
aficionado of American history. ``The way we look at the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> is
because of how <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bill showed it to us.''
   The collection, to be auctioned by <ORGANIZATION>Butterfield &amp; Butterfield</ORGANIZATION>,
includes the buffalo-hide coat worn by <PERSON>Cody</PERSON> and the gun he carried
as a 14-year-old <ORGANIZATION>Pony Express</ORGANIZATION> rider. Cody's single-action Colt
revolver, the type he used as a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION> scout, is one of eight
guns in the collection.
   Items such as a tomahawk from <ORGANIZATION>Cody</ORGANIZATION>'s friend D.F. ``White
Beaver'' <PERSON>Powell</PERSON>, along with dozens of photographs, show bills and
theater tickets chronicle <PERSON>Cody</PERSON>'s life as an Indian fighter, buffalo
hunter and scout who along with shooting champion W. ``Doc'' <PERSON>Carver</PERSON>
founded the first Wild West Show.
   For 11 years, after dime-novel writer <PERSON>Ned Buntline</PERSON> persuaded
Cody to appear in the first ``Scouts of the Prairie'' show, <PERSON>Cody</PERSON>
traveled between <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> theaters and the plains.
   The collection consists of items preserved by <ORGANIZATION>Cody</ORGANIZATION>'s adoring
sister, <PERSON>Julia Cody Goodman</PERSON>, and includes the <PERSON>Cody</PERSON> family Bible and
letters to <LOCATION>Julia</LOCATION> in which <ORGANIZATION>Cody</ORGANIZATION> discussed a troubled marriage, the
death of his son and other intimate events.
   The engraved shotgun, the only item not up for auction, will
remain in <ORGANIZATION>Martin</ORGANIZATION>'s home, a three-story Victorian crammed with
Western artifacts including a likeness of Chief Sitting Bull and
the pearl-handled <ORGANIZATION>Smith &amp; Wesson</ORGANIZATION> revolvers owned by <PERSON>Annie Oakley</PERSON>.
   Martin, a former real estate broker, once paid <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> for
<ORGANIZATION>Bill Harrah's Pony Express Museum</ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION>Reno</ORGANIZATION>, and maintains his
collection with the help of his wife, <PERSON>Petra</PERSON>, a former federal judge
in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>.
   He flew to Billings in search of the collection when he learned
<PERSON>Julia Cody Goodman</PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON>Josie</PERSON>, sold it for <MONEY>$1</MONEY> to a woman
named <PERSON>Stella Foote</PERSON> to keep it from going to the <ORGANIZATION>Cody Museum</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Cody</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyo.</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said.
   The collection traveled the world under the sponsorship of the
<ORGANIZATION>Department of Commerce</ORGANIZATION> before it was placed in storage by <PERSON>Foote</PERSON>.

the <ORGANIZATION>Bill Cody Ranch Resort</ORGANIZATION>, a hunting/fishing/riding lodge owned by <PERSON>Buffalo
Bill</PERSON>'s 78-year-old grandson, also named Bill Cody.;    A few miles up the

broken into four sections -- <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bill memorabilia, Western art, Plains
Indians and firearms. The museum is closed for the winter, but the group I was
with was lucky enough to get a two-hour tour of all but the firearms
collection, which was being moved to a newly-built wing.;    It was not nearly
enough time. I could have spent a day in the art section alone. It features
<PERSON>Frederic Remington</PERSON> and <PERSON>Charles M. Russell</PERSON> but has a massive collection of
other Western art.;    Officially called the <ORGANIZATION>Whitney Gallery of Western Art</ORGANIZATION>,
it was created through a grant by <PERSON>Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney</PERSON>. The gallery

in a new wing of the museum, displays the world's largest collection of
American-made guns.;    An interesting point made by our guide during the tour
of the Plains Indian section of the museum is that inside the museum are a
number of "medicine bundles," which are collections of items sacred to a
tribe.;    These bundles are kept in a special room with access denied to all
but specific Indians who, as representatives of their tribe, have a right to
see them. Even the curators of the museum cannot enter the room unless taken
in by a tribal representative.;    Another place worth visiting is the <LOCATION>Irma</LOCATION>, a
hotel Buffalo Bill built for his youngest daughter, <PERSON>Irma</PERSON>, in <DATE>1902</DATE>. Many of the
rooms in the hotel are being lovingly restored by the current owners.;    The
best rooms need to be booked well in advance, but an alternative is to dine in
the big room that used to be the hotel's bar room. The centerpiece is a bar
presented to Buffalo Bill by <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Queen Victoria</PERSON> in appreciation for a
command performance.;  IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; For more information on <ORGANIZATION>Cody</ORGANIZATION>, or

<TEXT>
   Seventy-two years after <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> stripped
<PERSON>Buffalo Bill Cody</PERSON> of his Medal of Honor, the Indian scout's name has
been restored to the honor roll.
   ``He's entitled to the honor, he was given the honor and he
should have the honor,'' said <PERSON>Buffalo Bill</PERSON>'s grandson, 76-year-old
<PERSON>Bill G. Cody</PERSON>. ``We've always contended that once he was awarded the
medal, they shouldn't revoke it _ especially after he was dead.''
   <PERSON>William F. ``Buffalo Bill'' Cody</PERSON>, who became a famous western
showman after the Indian wars, received the medal in <DATE>1872</DATE> for his
gallantry as an <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> scout during the wars.
   But it was revoked, along with medals of 910 other recipients, in
<DATE>1917</DATE> after <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> retroactively tightened up the rules for the
honor. Among other changes, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> held that only enlisted men and
officers could receive the award. A scout was considered a civilian;
in all, five scouts lost medals in <DATE>1917</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Sens. <PERSON>Alan Simpson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Malcolm Wallop</PERSON>, who jointly announced
the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>'s decision <DATE>Friday</DATE>, said <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bill deserved the honor.
   ``Today's action by the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> sets the record straight,'' <PERSON>Wallop</PERSON>
said. ``After extensive research and review of the facts, the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>
has decided that <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bill clearly deserves our nation's highest
honor.''
   Buffalo Bill gained fame for his western show that toured the
country and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> glamorizing the western frontier with real
cowboys and Indians re-enacting battles.
   <PERSON>Paul Fees</PERSON>, senior curator of the <ORGANIZATION>Buffalo Bill Historical Center</ORGANIZATION>
in <LOCATION>Cody</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyo.</LOCATION> _ a town named for <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bill _ said the western
show may have cost <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bill some credibility as a real hero.
   <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s action restores that credibility, said Fees.
   ``The fact that this medal was restored for cause, people can
believe that he was a true hero and earned his reputation rather
than had it invented for him through press agents,'' said Fees.
   Buffalo Bill, known by his contemporaries as a <ORGANIZATION>Pony Express</ORGANIZATION>
rider, Indian scout and buffalo hunter, received the honor for valor
after leading a cavalry charge against a raiding band of <ORGANIZATION>Sioux
Indians</ORGANIZATION>. He killed two, recovered several horses, and pursued the
retreating band.
   Although Buffalo <PERSON>Bill</PERSON>'s name was stricken from the Medal of Honor
roll in <DATE>February 1917</DATE>, one month after he died, the medal itself was
never recalled and remains in the historical center.
   Fees said only one of the other 910 persons to lose medals in the
<DATE>1917</DATE> purge of the rolls has since regained it, a woman <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> surgeon
during the Civil War whose medal was restored in <DATE>1978</DATE>.
   He said he hoped that the families of the other four scouts
affected by the 72-year-old ruling would take the same steps the
<PERSON>Cody</PERSON> family did to get their relatives' medals awarded again.

<TEXT>
   A forest fire that swept out of <ORGANIZATION>Yellowstone
National Park</ORGANIZATION> threatened a fir tree inscribed by western showman
<PERSON>Buffalo Bill Cody</PERSON>, and his grandson feared the worst for his
namesake's landmark.
   But it survived even though trees 6 feet away were burned.
   ``You talk about a miracle. I'll say it was,'' <PERSON>Bill Cody</PERSON> said.
   The fir tree's 4-foot-thick trunk was inscribed ``Camp Monaco
<DATE>1913</DATE>'' when <PERSON>Buffalo Bill</PERSON> was host to <ORGANIZATION>Prince Albert of Monaco</ORGANIZATION> on a
hunting trip in the <ORGANIZATION>Shoshone National Forest</ORGANIZATION>. Cody's famous Wild
West show was a hit in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
   ``It was about this time of year when <LOCATION>Granddad</LOCATION> took the prince
up there,'' <PERSON>Cody</PERSON> said.
   He had been worried about the tree ever since the Clover-Mist
fire surged into the North Fork drainage about two weeks ago, but a
helicopter flight over the area with <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Forest Service</ORGANIZATION> rangers
confirmed the tree was safe.
   Camp <ORGANIZATION>Monaco</ORGANIZATION> is a half day's horseback ride from <LOCATION>Pahaska Tepee</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Buffalo Bill</LOCATION>'s hunting lodge near <LOCATION>Yellowstone</LOCATION>'s east entrance.
   Cody said he had been considering attempting to salvage the
inscription if the tree burned, but he started to fear the worst
when he saw from the air how much damage the fire had caused.
   ``It was a disaster all the way up the <LOCATION>North Fork</LOCATION>. On both sides
of the river there was nothing but burn, burn, burn,'' he said.
   But when the helicopter approached a meadow near <LOCATION>Camp Monaco</LOCATION>,
<PERSON>Cody</PERSON> spotted a clump of green amid hundred of acres of black.
   ``It looked just like a pinpoint in the middle of a pie,'' he
said.``When I saw the tree was saved I let out a yell. There were
burned trees within 6 feet of it, and a bottle lying about 6 feet
away was scorched.''

With typical myopia borne of chauvinism, they talk about the Old West as the 
idyllic era when "Men Were Men." Starting this <DATE>weekend</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Gene Autry Western 
Heritage Museum</ORGANIZATION> will take a giant step toward correcting the impression, in a 
wide-open tribute to "Daring Women of the Wild West." 
</P>
<P>
The two-month salute will draw overdue attention to the role of women in 
<LOCATION>Western</LOCATION> rodeos and shows from the <DATE>1800s</DATE> to the present. Focus of the show will 
be an exhibit lent by the <ORGANIZATION>Buffalo Bill Cody Center of Cody</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Wyo.</LOCATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Cody</ORGANIZATION>'s shows 
featured a variety of feisty and courageous female performers), an exhibit 
enhanced by <PERSON>Autry</PERSON>'s own collection of show material from the <DATE>1880s</DATE> through the 
"Golden Age of Rodeos" in the <DATE>1920s</DATE> up to the barrel racers and other distaff 
daredevils of today. 
</P>
<P>
Special entertainment and pertinent films will include a pair of one-man shows 
by actor <PERSON>Eric Sorg</PERSON>, next <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> through <DATE>April 16</DATE>. Matinee performances, titled 
"<PERSON>Annie Oakley</PERSON> and the Wild West," will trace "Li'l Missy's" career as seen 
through the eyes of <ORGANIZATION>Cody</ORGANIZATION>, her mentor. Evening shows are "Cody! An Evening With 
Buffalo Bill," not entirely pertinent to the theme but a fascinating attempt to 
separate the reality from the myth of Cody. 
</P>
<P>
A series of musical performances will kick off today at <TIME>2 p.m.</TIME> with <PERSON>Patsy 
Montana</PERSON> -- first female Western singer to sell a million copies of her records 
-- and an all-women Western band playing twice each afternoon on <DATE>April 29</DATE> and 
<DATE>May 29</DATE>. Other entries in a rich and varied program will be cowgirl roping, 
Hollywood stuntwomen and films (<PERSON>Barbara Stanwyck</PERSON> 's "Annie Oakley" and <PERSON>Gail 
David</PERSON>'s TV series of the same name). 
</P>
<P>
General admission to the museum, at 4700 Zoo Drive in <LOCATION>Griffith Park</LOCATION> (adjacent 
to the zoo), is <MONEY>$4.75</MONEY>, students and seniors <MONEY>$3.50</MONEY>, children 2-12 years <MONEY>$2</MONEY>. 
Theater admission is <MONEY>$3</MONEY> for the general public and <MONEY>$1</MONEY> for museum members and

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Frederic Remington</PERSON>, the painter and sculptor
best known for his depiction of the Wild West, deserves recognition
as an American master, say the curators of a traveling exhibit of
his work that opens here today.
   ``Remington has been seen superficially,'' says <PERSON>Michael Edward
Shapiro</PERSON>, chief curator at the <ORGANIZATION>St. Louis Art Museum</ORGANIZATION>. ``He's been
stereotyped as a cowboy artist when he was a very sophisticated New
Yorker who drew from a lot of sources and created his own style,
which has astonishingly imprinted itself on the conscience of our
country.''
   <PERSON>Shapiro</PERSON> and <PERSON>Peter H. Hassrick</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Buffalo Bill
Historical Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Cody</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyo.</LOCATION>, organized ``<PERSON>Frederic Remington</PERSON>:
The Masterworks,'' the first major traveling exhibit of <ORGANIZATION>Remington</ORGANIZATION>'s
work.
   The exhibition consists of 46 paintings and drawings and 20
bronze sculptures Remington created from <DATE>1889</DATE>, when he was 28,
until he died in <DATE>1909</DATE> at age 48 of complications from appendicitis.
   Among the works are ``A Dash for the Timber,'' an <DATE>1889</DATE> painting
acknowledged as <PERSON>Remington</PERSON>'s first masterpiece, and ``The <PERSON>Bronco
Buster</PERSON>,'' possibly the best-known American bronze sculpture of the
<DATE>19th century</DATE>.
   Remington began his art career as an illustrator, with his Wild
West scenes turning up in several popular magazines, including
<PERSON>Harper</PERSON>'s Weekly. His work illustrated what <PERSON>Shapiro</PERSON> describes as the
forces of nature and man and the risk of death and danger in the
<LOCATION>West</LOCATION> in the action and energy of <LOCATION>Remington</LOCATION>'s horses and horsemen.
   He was especially successful at capturing the image of the horse
_ bucking, rearing, lunging, running at breakneck speed. ``There

adds.
   Indeed, <PERSON>Remington</PERSON> once told a drinking companion that if he
could have one thing written on his tombstone, it would be: ``He
knew the horse.''
   His subject was always the horse and its rider _ the
Indian-fighting soldier or the cowboy. But the West of the
homesteader, the farmer and the frontier-ending railroads held no
interest for him.
   ``While the rest of the country spoke of the advance of the
frontier, the `taming of the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>,' as a positive force in the
building of American civilization, to <LOCATION>Remington</LOCATION> the frontier was
receding and, in the end, a tragic loss,'' historian <PERSON>David
McCullough</PERSON> writes in the show's catalog.
   Remington was born <DATE>Oct. 4, 1861</DATE>, in <LOCATION>Canton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, the son of a
newspaper proprietor. He grew up in <LOCATION>Canton</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ogdensburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>,
then enrolled in the School of Fine Arts and joined the football
team at <ORGANIZATION>Yale University</ORGANIZATION>.
   He dropped out of <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> after a year and a half when his father
died and, at the age of 21, he headed west to make his fortune,
plunking down part of his inheritance on a sheep ranch near
<LOCATION>Peabody</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kan</LOCATION>.
   The sheep ranch failed, and <PERSON>Remington</PERSON> bought into a <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>
saloon, which also failed. His new wife had left him to go back to
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. Remington headed west again to sketch his way through <LOCATION>New
Mexico</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>.
   But by <DATE>1885</DATE>, <PERSON>Remington</PERSON> was back in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, reunited with his
wife and establishing himself as a magazine illustrator. In <DATE>1887</DATE>,
<PERSON>Harper</PERSON>'s Weekly carried 39 of his sketches and drawings, and the
next year more than 70.
   Remington's drawings also began to appear in <LOCATION>St. Nicholas</LOCATION> and
Outing magazines. He was commissioned by <ORGANIZATION>Century Illustrated
Magazine</ORGANIZATION> to illustrate a series of articles by a young <PERSON>Theodore
Roosevelt</PERSON>. The series later was made into a book titled ``Ranch
Life and the Hunting Trail.''
   Despite his popular success, <PERSON>Remington</PERSON> was never a critical
success, says <PERSON>Shapiro</PERSON>.
   His work was ``just seen as cowboys and Indians,'' he says,
``and there was a belief that cowboys and Indians wasn't serious
subject matter.''

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Frederic Remington</PERSON>, the painter and sculptor
best known for his depiction of the Wild West, deserves recognition
as an American master, say the curators of a traveling exhibit of
his work that opens here today.
   ``Remington has been seen superficially,'' says <PERSON>Michael Edward
Shapiro</PERSON>, chief curator at the <ORGANIZATION>St. Louis Art Museum</ORGANIZATION>. ``He's been
stereotyped as a cowboy artist when he was a very sophisticated New
Yorker who drew from a lot of sources and created his own style,
which has astonishingly imprinted itself on the conscience of our
country.''
   <PERSON>Shapiro</PERSON> and <PERSON>Peter H. Hassrick</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Buffalo Bill
Historical Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Cody</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyo.</LOCATION>, organized ``<PERSON>Frederic Remington</PERSON>:
The Masterworks,'' the first major traveling exhibit of <ORGANIZATION>Remington</ORGANIZATION>'s
work.
   The exhibition consists of 46 paintings and drawings and 20
bronze sculptures Remington created from <DATE>1889</DATE>, when he was 28,
until he died in <DATE>1909</DATE> at age 48 of complications from appendicitis.
   Among the works are ``A Dash for the Timber,'' an <DATE>1889</DATE> painting
acknowledged as <PERSON>Remington</PERSON>'s first masterpiece, and ``The <PERSON>Bronco
Buster</PERSON>,'' possibly the best-known American bronze sculpture of the
<DATE>19th century</DATE>.
   Remington began his art career as an illustrator, with his Wild
West scenes turning up in several popular magazines, including
<PERSON>Harper</PERSON>'s Weekly. His work illustrated what <PERSON>Shapiro</PERSON> describes as the
forces of nature and man and the risk of death and danger in the
<LOCATION>West</LOCATION> in the action and energy of <LOCATION>Remington</LOCATION>'s horses and horsemen.
   He was especially successful at capturing the image of the horse
_ bucking, rearing, lunging, running at breakneck speed. ``There
was never a more vivid depiction of the American horse,'' <PERSON>Shapiro</PERSON>
adds.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Theater:
   Scenes From the Wild West
   ----
   By Edwin Wilson
</HL>
<DATE>

WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A14
</SO>
<LP>
   Princeton, N.J. -- Buffalo Bill Cody and Wild Bill Hickok
are at the White House performing a scene from a play for the
president and the first lady. In the scene, written by
19th-century author Ned Buntline, Cody and Hickok play
themselves: It features the two men rescuing an Indian maiden
in distress. Halfway through, Wild Bill rebels: He won't
"play-act" any longer. Suddenly he turns and puts a knife
into Buntline's back, and starts out after the actress who's
playing the maiden, to seduce her himself. The president and
his wife, thinking this is part of the action, are delighted.
   For Buffalo Bill, the chief character in Arthur Kopit's
play "Indians," this is symptomatic of his whole life:
Nothing turns out the way he thought it would. Hired by the
railroads to provide workers with food, he kills 4,280
buffalos, practically wiping out the Indians' supply. "How
did I know buffalo breed so slow?" he moans.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sitting Bull, who had ignominiously defeated Gen. <PERSON>Custer</PERSON>
at the Little Bighorn, became <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bill's friend. After
promising Sitting Bull that he would persuade the president
to come talk to him in person about Indian grievances,
<LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bill can only produce three pompous, insensitive
senators. Attempting, finally, to effect some compromise
between the government and Sitting Bull, he must stand by
helplessly as <ORGANIZATION>Sitting Bull</ORGANIZATION> is brutally assassinated and a few
days later his Sioux Indian followers are massacred at
Wounded Knee.
   After being made a hero by Buntline in novels and plays,
<LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bill, prior to Wounded Knee, produced his own Wild
West show in which he featured not only Wild <PERSON>Bill Hickok</PERSON> and
Sitting Bull, but <PERSON>Annie Oakley</PERSON>, <PERSON>Geronimo</PERSON> and others. It was
playwright <PERSON>Kopit</PERSON>'s inspired idea to use the Wild West
framework to produce a play that moves back and forth from
actual events to scenes from the show. As in real life, there
is a natural affinity between show business and history. We
have the pageantry of Indian ceremonies and mock shoot-outs,
mixed with heartbreaking scenes of betrayal and
misunderstanding between the federal government and the
Indians.
   In some ways <PERSON>Mr. Kopit</PERSON>'s play was ahead of its time. First
produced by the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Shakespeare Company</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, it
opened on Broadway in <DATE>1969</DATE>, after which it disappeared from
sight. It is one of those underrated, overlooked plays that
not only speaks to an issue still very much alive, but is a
highly charged coup de theatre. "Indians" is just the kind of
play important regional theaters should produce. And now,
<ORGANIZATION>McCarter Theater</ORGANIZATION>, in its recently renovated space, has done
just that.
   That's the good news. The not-so-good news is that
director <PERSON>George Faison</PERSON> has not given it the kind of
production it deserves. The visual elements are there --
stunning scenery, lighting and costumes -- but the show
itself does not do justice to the theatrical nature of the
play. Being part of a Wild West show, we should be caught up
in hoopla and razzle-dazzle; we should rush headlong from one
scene to the next. But <PERSON>Mr. Faison</PERSON>, quite unaccountably, moves
the action at snail's pace. He lets one scene come to a
complete halt, takes a long pause, and painstakingly begins
the next scene. The action should unfold the way <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bill
fells fake buffalo or <PERSON>Annie Oakley</PERSON> shoots clay pigeons: bam,
bam, bam.
   <PERSON>Mr. Faison</PERSON> fares no better with his lead performer, <PERSON>Robert
Joy</PERSON>. Instead of his tepid performance, Buffalo Bill should be
charisma personified, not only to give the play a lift and a
self-assurance, but to provide a contrast with the lost,
bewildered figure who stumbles about the stage at the end.
   Despite these handicaps, there is still much to enjoy at
<ORGANIZATION>McCarter</ORGANIZATION>. The electric scene between Sitting Bull (<PERSON>Mel Duane
Gionson</PERSON>) and the three senators (<PERSON>John Tillotson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Don Perkins</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Gordon Stanley</PERSON>) is theater at its best, and several
performances -- <PERSON>Jay Patterson</PERSON> as Wild <PERSON>Bill Hickok</PERSON>, for
instance -- let us see just how much excitement "Indians" can
produce.
   Meanwhile, the first production of the Broadway season is
also a revival: <PERSON>Paul Osborn</PERSON>'s "On Borrowed Time" at the
Circle in the Square Theater. The chief attraction here is
actor <PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON>, who has traded in the gruff Gen.
<PERSON>Patton</PERSON> of films and the "Bah, Humbug" Scrooge of television
for lovable Gramps. <PERSON>Mr. Scott</PERSON> not only plays the lead but has
directed the production, assembling a strong cast that
includes <PERSON>Teresa Wright</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bette Henritze</PERSON>, <PERSON>Nathan Lane</PERSON>, <PERSON>Conrad
Bain</PERSON> and a very talented young actor, <PERSON>Matthew Porac</PERSON>.
   "On Borrowed Time" opened on Broadway in <DATE>1938</DATE>, one night
before <PERSON>Thornton Wilder</PERSON>'s "Our Town," with which it has much
in common. Both are set in small-town <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, both rely
heavily on fantasy and both underscore the necessity of
accepting the inevitability of death. In "On Borrowed Time,"
Gramps (<PERSON>Mr. Scott</PERSON>) is taking care of his grandson Pud (<PERSON>Mr.
Porac</PERSON>) when the boy's father and mother, away for the day on
a trip, are killed in an auto accident.
   Death appears in the form of <PERSON>Mr. Brink</PERSON>, played with
tremendous eclat by <PERSON>Mr. Lane</PERSON> dressed in formal <DATE>1930s</DATE> men's
attire. <PERSON>Mr. Brink</PERSON> has come to claim Gramps's wife (<PERSON>Ms.
Wright</PERSON>), who dies during the course of the action, and also
Gramps, who has several sinking spells. Before <PERSON>Mr. Brink</PERSON> can
corner him though, Gramps traps him in a tree, which means
that as long as <PERSON>Mr. Brink</PERSON> remains there, not only Gramps, but
no one on earth can die.
   Despite the emphasis on death, "On Borrowed Time" has
several uproarious scenes, some between Gramps and <PERSON>Mr. Brink</PERSON>
and others between Gramps and the prune-faced maiden aunt
(<PERSON>Ms. Henritze</PERSON>) who wants to get her hands on Pud and raise
him according to the strict precepts of her church. Gramps's
doctor (<PERSON>Mr. Bain</PERSON>) and lawyer (<PERSON>George DiCenzo</PERSON>), who cannot see
<PERSON>Mr. Brink</PERSON>, are convinced <ORGANIZATION>Gramps</ORGANIZATION> is insane and bring the head
of the local mental asylum (<ORGANIZATION>Allen Williams</ORGANIZATION>) to take him away
in a straitjacket. The joke here is that the head of the
asylum is far loonier than any of his patients.
   In the end, Gramps realizes that you cannot forestall
death, that inevitably it must be accepted. At the same time,
death will never be pleasanter, on stage or off, than it is
in "On Borrowed Time."

<P>
The <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bills' <PERSON>Thurman Thomas</PERSON>, running through the kinds of holes tailbacks 
usually only dream of, rushed for 214 yards <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> in a 30-7 victory over 
the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Jets. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas' best rushing total as a pro compares to the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> record of 275 yards by 
<PERSON>Walter Payton</PERSON> in <DATE>1977</DATE> and the Bill mark of 273 by <ORGANIZATION>O.J. Simpson</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1976</DATE>. Thomas 
averaged nearly 12 yards per carry. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think of it as an individual effort," <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said. "It truly was team 
play. The offense came out with fire in their eyes, and they just knocked huge 
holes in the defense." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas had several big games as an All-American at <LOCATION>Oklahoma State</LOCATION>, where he 
preceded <PERSON>Barry Sanders</PERSON> as the star running back. This was different. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought in the NFL I would be 20 yards downfield without ever being 
touched, just me and a safety," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Bill tackle <PERSON>Howard Ballard</PERSON>: "We didn't really expect it to be that easy. 
We just blew them out." 
</P>
<P>
The Bills (2-1) wanted to show they are not the same bickering outfit that 
struggled to win the AFC East championship last year. The Jets (1-2) sought to 
show they are a playoff contender. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Bills who were convincing in moving back into first place in the <LOCATION>AFC 
East</LOCATION>, where they stood for 33 weeks before a 30-7 loss at <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> <DATE>last week</DATE>. 
After that game, star defensive end <PERSON>Bruce Smith</PERSON> was fined for shouting at Coach 
<PERSON>Marv Levy</PERSON> on the sidelines when Levy removed six starters with seven minutes to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Said Jet Coach <PERSON>Bruce Coslet</PERSON>: "No team should really be allowed to manhandle us 
like that. They dominated the line of scrimmage. We have to play very well to 
have a chance against a playoff team like <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
Was it a step backward for the Jets? 
</P>
<P>
"Probably," <PERSON>Coslet</PERSON> said. "But I'm not concerned about the psyche. This is not 
last year's team. We have a lot of confidence. We stubbed our toe." 
</P>
<P>
The Bills took a 20-7 halftime lead after <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> ran for 146 yards in 10 
carries, two yards short of his career high for a full game, against <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> last 
season. Buffalo had 305 yards and the Jets 87 in the half. 
</P>
<P>
"We established just what we wanted to do in the first half," <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> 
quarterback <PERSON>Jim Kelly</PERSON> said. "We took it from there." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't get any better for <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> in the second half. Thomas keyed an 
85-yard, nine-play drive with 56 yards rushing, including a 34-yard burst on a 
quick-opener. <PERSON>Scott Norwood</PERSON>'s 27-yard field goal made the score 23-7 and <PERSON>Keith 
McKeller</PERSON> caught a six-yard touchdown pass from <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets had gone 13 consecutive quarters without a touchdown against <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> 
before scoring 4:59 into the game on <PERSON>Brad Baxter</PERSON>'s one-yard run. Their last 
touchdown against the Bills was scored <DATE>Oct. 17, 1988</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Jet wide receiver <PERSON>Al Toon</PERSON> had two receptions before being sidelined because of 
a bruised back. He has caught a pass in 65 consecutive games.

<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Buffalo Bills</ORGANIZATION> entered their game against the <ORGANIZATION>New England Patriots</ORGANIZATION> with an 
NFL-high 274 points. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, the Patriots held the Bills to 14 points, but that was still more 
than enough against the league's worst team. 
</P>
<P>
Thurman Thomas provided the clinching touchdown on an 80-yard run with under 
two minutes left <DATE>Sunday</DATE> to lead the Bills to a 14-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills (9-1), who scored 87 points in their previous two games, won for the 
eighth consecutive time. The Patriots (1-9) lost their eighth game in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"We just got bad breaks," Patriot running back <PERSON>George Adams</PERSON> said. "We took the 
field like we were 8-1, not 1-8. We know what we can do; it's just a matter of 
time." 
</P>
<P>
It was the second shutout in three weeks for the Bills, who blanked <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>, 
42-0, two weeks ago. The Patriots had not been shut out since <DATE>Nov. 20, 1983</DATE>, by 
<LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, who had 22 carries for 165 yards, also scored in the <DATE>first quarter</DATE> on a 
five-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo quarterback <PERSON>Jim Kelly</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>AFC</ORGANIZATION>'s top-rated passer, completed only five 
of 15 passes for 79 yards as the Bills managed only 288 yards of offense. 
</P>
<P>
Patriot quarterback <PERSON>Marc Wilson</PERSON> completed 21 of 33 passes for 234 yards and had 
two passes intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots came closest to scoring early in the <DATE>second quarter</DATE> after driving 
54 yards. 
</P>
<P>
With the Bills leading, 7-0, the Patriots had a first and goal from the <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> 
one-yard-line. Three plays later, it was fourth-and-goal from the one and the 
Patriots went for it. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Marvin Allen</PERSON>, who ran effectively early in the game, tried to run off the right 
side of the offensive line. But <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> linebacker <PERSON>Ray Bentley</PERSON> shot through and 
stopped him for a one-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
"About four guys hit me and I shed them all and got in there," <PERSON>Bentley</PERSON> said 
jokingly. "Actually, the guard pulled out of there and I just went in where he 
left and came through untouched." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bentley</PERSON> said he was surprised the Patriots tried to run the ball, but once they 
came to the line of scrimmage, he said he knew what play was coming. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't necessarily know that the guard would pull, but that's a scheme they 
do have," he said. "We had great penetration on the other side to keep the back 
from bouncing outside so I could get to him." 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>New England Coach Rod Rust</ORGANIZATION> said he didn't regret the call. "It was a good 
defense against the play." 
</P>
<P>
The play seemed to inspire the Bills' defense, which kept the Patriots in check 
until <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION>'s next-to-last drive. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots moved from their 14 to the <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> 38. But the drive ended when 
rookie <PERSON>James Williams</PERSON> intercepted a pass by <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> in the end zone that was 
intended for <PERSON>Irving Fryar</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a feeling they were going to try and go toward me because I was a rookie 
out there," said <PERSON>Williams</PERSON>, the Bills' first-round draft choice who was starting 
for injured <PERSON>Kirby Jackson</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo got the ball on its 20 and the Patriots let Thomas slice through the 
line on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
"We were basically just trying to get a first down," <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said. "The 
offensive line came off the ball well. Usually, that play doesn't cut back all 
the way to the right, but the hole was so big I just had to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Patriot safety <PERSON>Fred Marion</PERSON> said his team was "cutting down on giving up the 
easy stuff. But he (<PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>) broke right, they made good blocks and we didn't 
get over to make the play."

The clincher came in Week 12 last season, and this year it was on the <DATE>Saturday</DATE> 
of the <DATE>last weekend</DATE>. Both clinchers, however, were at the expense of the <LOCATION>New 
York</LOCATION> Jets. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jim Kelly</PERSON>'s two touchdowns led the Bills to a 37-0 victory, as one-sided as 
last year's divisional race. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year it was early, this year it was struggle, struggle, but we're there 
again," <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> nose tackle <PERSON>Fred Smerlas</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
There was no struggle for the Jets <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, except for the few fans who 
ventured to <ORGANIZATION>Giants Stadium</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The game started with the temperature at 16 degrees and a wind-chill factor of 
minus-11. There were 21,148 in attendance, but there were 55,743 no-shows, 
believed to be an <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> record. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd was the smallest at a non-strike Jet game since 5,826 attended a game 
against <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>Polo Grounds</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Dec. 14, 1963</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a real stinging wind," <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>Marv Levy</PERSON> said. "It was one of 
the nicer days we've seen in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
The weather and the loss weren't all that made it a bleak day for Jet Coach <PERSON>Joe 
Walton</PERSON>. It has been widely speculated this was his last game as Jet coach after 
taking over for the <DATE>1983</DATE> season. 
</P>
<P>
"If you stay in this business long enough, there are going to be bad times," 
said <PERSON>Walton</PERSON>, who said he wants to return next season. "I'll meet with the team 
tomorrow, thank them and wish them a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year." 
</P>
<P>
The Bills (9-7), who had lost five of seven, ended a three-game losing streak. 
"Is it a relief to win it?" Levy asked, repeating a question. "There's always 
that pressure, but it is sweet. We've struggled hard to get here. We have been 
in first place for 32 straight weeks. It's hard to please people." 
</P>
<P>
The division title was the sixth for the Bills, who lost to <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> in the 
<ORGANIZATION>AFC</ORGANIZATION> championship game last season. 
</P>
<P>
"This team deserves a lot of credit," <PERSON>Levy</PERSON> said. "They hung in there and won 
the division by earning it." 
</P>
<P>
The Jets, who lost to <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>, 34-3, earlier in the season, finished 4-12, 
their worst record since going 4-12 in <DATE>1980</DATE>. Instead of playoffs, what's next 
for the franchise is a much-awaited meeting <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> between <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dick 
Steinberg</PERSON>, the team's new general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly finished 13 for 21 for 208 yards with <PERSON>Andre Reed</PERSON> catching six passes for 
80 yards. "We were the Bills of the first five games today," <PERSON>Reed</PERSON> said. "Our 
offense was clicking and our defense was clicking." 
</P>
<P>
The Bills opened the scoring with a 26-yard field goal by <PERSON>Scott Norwood</PERSON> with 
4:26 to play in the <DATE>first quarter</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets, who were shut out by <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> two weeks ago, had one scoring chance 
but it ended when <PERSON>Pat Leahy</PERSON>'s 30-yard field goal attempt was blocked with 8:14 
left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
It was all <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> from there. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Larry Kinnebrew</PERSON> ran in from one yard 1:07 before halftime for a 10-0 lead. The 
Bills stretched it out in the third with <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> connecting with <PERSON>James Lofton</PERSON> on 
a 25-yard pass play with 10:49 left in the quarter. It was the same distance on 
the next scoring play, this time a pass to <PERSON>Ronnie Harmon</PERSON> in the left corner of 
the end zone, and the Bills led, 23-0, with 4:39 left in the third. 
</P>
<P>
"That touchdown before the half was big, but the game still wasn't over then," 
<PERSON>Levy</PERSON> said. "Jim played very well. He was a big contributor. Our team has to 
continue to play well, not just <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON>." 
</P>
<P>
The Bills made the score 30-0 on a three-yard run by <PERSON>Thurman Thomas</PERSON> shortly 
before the <DATE>third quarter ended</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kenneth Davis</PERSON> ended the scoring with a 17-yard run with 2:44 to play. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kinnebrew</PERSON> had 91 yards in 17 carries, while <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> had 73 in 17 carries.

East</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION> is 3-2, second in the AFC West.; BILLS UPDATE: All-Pro DE
<PERSON>Bruce Smith</PERSON> is making his second start since recovering from knee surgery.
With <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> and NT <PERSON>Jeff Wright</PERSON> out because of injuries, the defense has given
up an average of 137 yards a game rushing -- a big factor in opponents
averaging 23 points per game. <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> did not have a tackle in his first game
back <DATE>last week</DATE>, but in beating the previously unbeaten <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Bears 35-20</ORGANIZATION>,
<LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> held <PERSON>Neal Anderson</PERSON> to 54 yards rushing and the Bears to 84 rushing

<LEADPARA>  Mercury News Staff Writer;   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- When it comes to a Buffalo

and individual plaudits with a pinball machine, just to keep up with the

<HEADLINE>  KELLY, THOMAS KEY BILLS
BUFFALO MAINTAINS MASTERY OF DOLPHINS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  The NFL/Week 1  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The numbers rattled off with a familiar vengeance <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. Running back
<PERSON>Thurman Thomas</PERSON> became the first <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> player with more than 100 yards
rushing and receiving in the same game. Wide receiver <PERSON>Andre Reed</PERSON> caught 11
passes for 154 yards and a touchdown. Quarterback <PERSON>Jim Kelly</PERSON>, overcoming an
ankle injury, threw for 381 yards -- the most in his career -- leading the
Bills to a wild, season-opening 35-31 victory over the Dolphins before 80,252
at Rich Stadium.;   Considering <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>'s 44-34 loss in the snowy <DATE>Jan. 12</DATE>
playoff game on Rich Stadium's tundra and a 24-14 stumble last <DATE>December</DATE>
against the Bills that erased all hope of home-field advantage in the
playoffs, you could say the Dolphins were primed to wash away the memories of
last season's bad luck against <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>. But the Bills, depleted as they were
on defense without pass-rushing defensive end <PERSON>Bruce Smith</PERSON>, who still is
nursing a surgically repaired right knee, have retained the deed when it comes
to owning <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>'s number.;   "It's depressing knowing that they knocked us out
of home-field advantage up here and they knocked us out of the playoffs up
here in <DATE>January</DATE> and then to start the year, they do it to us again," said
<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>Don Shula</PERSON>, whose team is minus 11 starters, four of whom are
contract holdouts.;   The Bills, despite early use of their defense-rattling,
no-huddle attack, had to come back to do it.;   Kicker <PERSON>Scott Norwood</PERSON>, the goat
of Super Bowl XXV for missing a 47-yard field goal with four seconds
remaining, preserving the <ORGANIZATION>New York Giants</ORGANIZATION>' <DATE>20-19</DATE> victory, choked <DATE>Sunday</DATE> on a
25-yard gimme capping <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>'s opening drive. <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> then took a 7-0 lead as
<PERSON>Dan Marino</PERSON> (17 of 28, 267 yards, three touchdowns) tossed 43-yard flea-flicker
to <PERSON>Mark Clayton</PERSON> for a touchdown -- keeping <PERSON>Clayton</PERSON>'s streak of consecutive
games with at least one reception alive at 64 -- with 8 minutes, 56 seconds
remaining in the first quarter.;   An interception by safety <PERSON>Louis Oliver</PERSON> set
up a 3-yard run by running back <PERSON>Mark Higgs</PERSON>, a return man who rushed for 146
yards in 30 carries filling in for starter <PERSON>Sammie Smith</PERSON>, who's out with a knee
injury. Higgs' touchdown put <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> ahead 14-0.;   By then, though, the
Kelly-Thomas machine was primed to go. On third-and-five from the <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>
46-yard line, <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> launched a 54-yard scoring pass to <ORGANIZATION>Reed</ORGANIZATION>, pulling the Bills
closer, 14-7, with 8:45 remaining before halftime.;   <PERSON>Charlie Baumann</PERSON>'s
21-yard field goal at the start of the third period increased <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>'s lead to
17-7. And the Bills' problems seemed to worsen when <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> came up limping
after Dolphins nose tackle <PERSON>T.J. Turner</PERSON> rolled onto <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON>'s left ankle on a
sack attempt.;   <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> left the field, ostensibly for the rest of the game
with a sprain. But three plays later, backup <PERSON>Frank Reich</PERSON> hit tight end <PERSON>Butch
Rolle</PERSON> on a 3-yard play-action fake, pulling <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> closer, 17-14.;   Would
that be it for <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON>? Hey, this guy's tough. No way.;   "It's going to take a
lot more than a bum ankle to keep me out of a game," said <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON>, who came back
to complete 29 of 39 attempts, with two touchdown passes.;   So back he came
on the next series, driving <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> 30 yards to midfield. On second-and-eight,
<PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> threw 30 yards on a post to <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>, who blew past safety <PERSON>Jarvis Williams</PERSON>
and sprinted 20 yards down the right sideline for a 50-yard touchdown
reception, giving the Bills their first lead, 21-17, with 2:10 left in the
third quarter.;   Wide receiver <PERSON>Don Beebe</PERSON>'s fumble set up a 5-yard scoring
pass from <PERSON>Marino</PERSON> to <PERSON>Clayton</PERSON> (6 catches, 138 yards two touchdowns), and <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>
regained the lead 24-21 with 11:18 remaining.;   But the Bills answered with a
1-yard touchdown run by fullback <PERSON>Carwell Gardner</PERSON> to pull ahead again, 28-24.; 
 Thomas scored from seven yards out to increase the lead to 35-24, and <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>
capped the scoring with <PERSON>Marino</PERSON>'s 3-yard touchdown toss to Duper with 2:32
remaining.; BILLS 35, DOLPHINS 31; (box) THE HERO: <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Thurman Thomas</PERSON>
rushed for 165 yards and added 108 yards receiving to become the first Bill to
surpass 100 yards in both categories in one game.;   (box) THE GOAT: Bills
kicker <PERSON>Scott Norwood</PERSON>, who missed the potential winning field goal in the Super

<MEMO>  Monday's Score; CHIEFS 33, BILLS 6; Highlight: Derrick Thomas had four of
Kansas City's six sacks, and Buffalo lost five fumbles.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "We've all been around long enough to know that isn't the <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bills
football team," <PERSON>Schottenheimer</PERSON> said after the Chiefs romped to a 33-6 victory
over the previously unbeaten AFC champions. "It was one of those nights where
everything fell our way.";   The Bills, averaging more than 32 points and 450
yards in winning their first five games, suffered six sacks, five lost fumbles
and their most lopsided loss in four years. They managed only 211 net yards,
and the Chiefs (4-2), who had only 182 yards the week before in a one-point
victory over <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, rolled to 397.;   "This was not only the best
defensive game I've ever been associated with," said defensive end <PERSON>Bill Maas</PERSON>,
who had two sacks. "It was the greatest game I've ever been associated with.";
  The victory snapped a five-game <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> losing streak for the Chiefs,
who had not played a <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> game in <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION> since <DATE>1983.</DATE>;   "There
was a lot of energy, a lot of adrenaline flowing," <PERSON>Maas</PERSON> said. "Our defense
shut down the No. 1 offense. Our offense held the ball and ran and ran and
ran. It was a night to remember.";   <PERSON>Christian Okoye</PERSON>, who rushed for 130 yards
and set a team record with his 13th 100-yard game, turned two <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>
turnovers into two touchdowns less than two minutes apart in the <DATE>third quarter</DATE>
for a 30-6 lead.;   Okoye reached the 100-yard rushing plateau for the 13th
time in his five-year career and passed <PERSON>Abner Haynes</PERSON> as the Chief with the
most 100-yard rushing games.;   Rookie <PERSON>Harvey Williams</PERSON> rushed for 103 yards.; 
 "By the time the <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE> rolled around, it was glorious," <PERSON>Maas</PERSON> said.; 
 "We gave them so many gifts, they should be happy until next <DATE>Christmas</DATE>," said
<PERSON>Kelly</PERSON>, who hit 17 of 23 passes for 189 yards.;   The Bills, who hadn't been
held without a TD since <DATE>Dec. 4, 1988</DATE>, suffered their worst defeat since a 47-6
loss to <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION> by replacement players during the <DATE>1987</DATE> strike. <PERSON>Derrick
Thomas</PERSON> had four of the <ORGANIZATION>Chiefs</ORGANIZATION>' sacks, with two of them causing fumbles.;   "We
believed in each other," <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said. "We thought we could get the job done.";
  The Bills still were in the game when <PERSON>Thurman Thomas</PERSON> took a pass from <PERSON>Jim
Kelly</PERSON> deep in <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> territory and was immediately hit by <PERSON>Lonnie Marts</PERSON>, who
knocked the ball loose for <PERSON>Kevin Ross</PERSON> to scoop up and run 13 yards to the
<LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> 17.;   One play later, <PERSON>Okoye</PERSON> went over for a 23-6 lead with 2 minutes,
52 seconds left in the <DATE>third quarter</DATE>. A moment later, <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> sacked <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON>,
knocking the ball loose, and <PERSON>Dan Saleaumua</PERSON> recovered on the 11. On
fourth-and-goal from the 2, <PERSON>Okoye</PERSON> knocked a defender backward into the end
zone.;   A fumble by <PERSON>Don Beebe</PERSON> on the ensuing kickoff led to <PERSON>Nick Lowery</PERSON>'s
22-yard field goal. Lowery also kicked a 41-yarder in the <DATE>first quarter</DATE>, a
40-yarder in the second and a 24-yarder in the third.;   <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>, the Bills'
leading rusher, left the game late in the quarter with an apparent ankle
injury.;   Even the officiating went against the Bills. Officials placed the
ball 5 yards away from where they should have after replay officials
overturned a <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> pass completion in the third period.;   The Bills were
without All-Pro defensive end <PERSON>Bruce Smith</PERSON>, who is out with a knee injury. But
it was a miserable homecoming for Bills' Coach <PERSON>Marv Levy</PERSON>, who coached the
Chiefs from 1978-82.;   "If a team can succeed in running the ball as well as
they did, you're in for a long night," <PERSON>Levy</PERSON> said. "They just overpowered us. I
hope we're not as bad as we looked. I think most routs -- and this was a rout
-- are not indicative of the difference between the two teams.";   The Chiefs
won with a formula all teams attempt against <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>: Once you get the
football, hold on to it for long drives and eat the clock. <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION> led in
plays (38-28) and in possession time (19 minutes 15 seconds to 10:45) as it
built a 13-6 halftime lead.;   The Chiefs scored on the game's first
possession on <LOCATION>Lowery</LOCATION>'s 41-yard field goal.;   Then with 7:40 left in the
<DATE>quarter</DATE>, <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION> tight end <PERSON>Jonathon Hayes</PERSON>, after a huge hit by linebacker
<PERSON>Darryl Talley</PERSON>, fumbled at the Chiefs<DATE>' 31</DATE> and cornerback <PERSON>Nate Odomes</PERSON> recovered
for Buffalo.;   But <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION> got the ball back with 5:46 left when <PERSON>Maas</PERSON>

<TEXT>
   Thirty dusty days on the <ORGANIZATION>Jim Bridger Trail</ORGANIZATION>
ended in rain <DATE>Monday</DATE> as the <ORGANIZATION>Wyoming Centennial Wagon Train</ORGANIZATION> rolled
into Cody with modern-day pioneers who relived the past to
celebrate the state's 100th birthday.
   Approximately 200 wagons and 1,600 riders on horseback were
greeted with a great whooping and hollering from several thousand
well-wishers who jammed streets and roof tops to watch the
four-mile-long procession.
   ``I wouldn't have bet there were this many horses in this whole
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>,'' lifelong Cody resident <PERSON>Frank McJunkin</PERSON>, 70, said as
he watched the parade of covered wagons, horses and exhausted but
delighted riders ramble by.
   The cavalry led the wagon train to the end of its 260-mile trek
along the <PERSON>Jim Bridger Trail</PERSON>, one of the main pioneer routes
northwest through <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>. Riders recreating the <ORGANIZATION>Pony Express</ORGANIZATION>
followed with state centennial flags.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <PERSON>Sen. Alan Simpson</PERSON>, in a red Western shirt and beaded vest,
rode the last few miles with the wagon train and predicted that
years from now everyone will claim they rode along.
   ``There'll be as many people saying they rode the <ORGANIZATION>Wyoming
Centennial Wagon Train</ORGANIZATION> as said they saw Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s last game at
Yankee Stadium _ about 7 million,'' said <PERSON>Simpson</PERSON>, who grew up in
this frontier town founded by showman <ORGANIZATION>Buffalo Bill Cody</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Kayne Pyatt</PERSON>, the trail boss who oversaw the journey organized by
a group of enthusiasts, said, ``It's sort of like I've lived a
great childhood adventure, a fantasy. ... If I died tomorrow, I'd
be satisfied.''
   The riders started the day about 16 miles east of Cody and
followed alongside <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 14A, encountering a torrential downpour
about a mile out.
   Simpson and his wife, <PERSON>Ann</PERSON>, were joined on the final leg by
<LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Mike Sullivan</PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON>Jane</PERSON>, and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> Rep.
<PERSON>Craig Thomas</PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON>Susan</PERSON>, all on horseback. <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> Gov.
<PERSON>Stan Stephens</PERSON> rode in a red surry.
   The sun broke through as they reached the edge of town, but
distant thunder and lightning added a dramatic backdrop. Horses
reared and bucked, riders waved and hollered and a few wagon
passengers played their fiddles to the Cody crowd.
   ``Cody loves you,'' some spectators yelled. ``Happy birthday
Wyoming!''
   Some of the trail riders welcomed the return to modern
conveniences, while others regretted reaching the end of the line.
   ``In a way, it's sad and in a way I'm glad to roll into <PERSON>Cody</PERSON>,''
said <PERSON>Ken Hagen</PERSON>, 71, of <LOCATION>Roseau</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Minn.</LOCATION> ``The dust was the worst. Some
days, there was so much dust you couldn't see the team ahead of
you. And for six days, we never saw a tree.''
   The final miles brought together past and present, as modern-day
vehicles on the highway buzzed by the rumbling replica wagons.
   ``This is a chance for a person like me to be a part of history,
maybe not a significant part, but a part,'' said <PERSON>Mike Wozniak</PERSON>, of
Casper, who spent two days on the trail. ``This wagon train is not
going to happen again _ maybe not for another 100 years.''
   The train left <LOCATION>Fort Caspar</LOCATION> <DATE>June 2</DATE>. Besides the dust, it was
accompanied by fears the organizers wouldn't be able to pay their
bills.
   Arriving here, the organizers estimated they were about <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY>
shy of the approximately <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> they figured they'd need to pay
for things like hay, water and portable toilets.
   Participating costs ranged from <MONEY>$40</MONEY> a day to just ride along in
your own rig, to <MONEY>$198</MONEY> a day to ride on one provided.
   The organizers also raised money through contests and auctions
along the trail, and plan to raffle off an elk permit donated by
Gov. <PERSON>Mike Sullivan</PERSON>.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Sport: Bills seek their place in history - American Football
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<PERSON>MARV LEVY</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> graduate, history buff and poetry lover, talks a mean
game of American football.
The silver-haired head coach of the <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bills analyses the strategies
and tactics of the sport in a precise, elegant manner. His comments in press
conferences can come laced with literary allusions. He uses words like
'inculcate' and 'salient' in pre-game meetings with his team.
Tomorrow in <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>, however, the erudite <PERSON>Levy</PERSON> will leave the talking to
his players, who must play a mean game of football if they are to defeat the
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Redskins in Superbowl XXVI.
The Redskins start as favourites, and are expected to win by at least seven
points according to the bookmakers in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>. Yet for those of us who
have enjoyed watching the Bills this season, it is difficult to think of
them as underdogs.
Under <PERSON>Levy</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> has set the <ORGANIZATION>National Football League</ORGANIZATION> alight in the past
two seasons with a rapid-fire passing and running game which led the team to
a host of high scoring victories.
At the root of their success is the 'no-huddle' offense - a tactic that
dispenses with the huddle before each play and allows the quarterback to
call his own moves. At its best, the no-huddle offense puts points on the
board quickly and leaves opposing defenses scrambling to keep up with the
pace.
At the heart of the Bills attack are two great players, quarterback <PERSON>Jim
Kelly</PERSON> and all-purpose running back <PERSON>Thurman Thomas</PERSON>. Kelly is an experienced
leader with a sharp tactical brain and a strong arm, while <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> is a
superb all-rounder, a quicksilver runner and an acrobatic receiver.
Powered by <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> and <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>, and supported by receivers <PERSON>James Lofton</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Andre Reed</PERSON>, the Bills topped the statistical tables in a number of key
attacking categories this season, including most total yards gained and most
touchdowns scored.
So with all their offensive firepower, why aren't the Bills favourites to
win?
There are two reasons, and both come down to defense. The Redskins' defense
is strong, against both the running and the passing game, and it ranks third
best in the league for overall effectiveness.
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s defense is especially good at 'blitzing' the quarterback - in
the 16 regular games this season they reached opposing quarterbacks and
sacked them 50 times. <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> has looked vulnerable to the sack in the past,
particularly two weekends ago when the <ORGANIZATION>Denver Broncos</ORGANIZATION>' blitzed relentlessly,
giving <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> insufficient time to get his no-huddle offense into gear.
The fragility of their own defense, which ranked next-to-last in the league
this season, is the second reason why the Bills are not favourites tomorrow.
They have shown an improvement in the playoffs (holding <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> to just seven
points in the AFC Championship game), thanks partly to the return of two
powerful players, slashing defensive end <PERSON>Bruce Smith</PERSON> and bulldozing nose
tackle <PERSON>Jeff Wright</PERSON>.
Yet in the <LOCATION>Redskins</LOCATION>, the Bills defense will be facing one of the toughest
offensive lines in football. This is where the 'Hogs' come in. Hogs is the
collective nickname for the enormous front-line that defends Redskins'
quarterback <PERSON>Mark Rypien</PERSON>.
Not only are the Hogs good at giving <PERSON>Rypien</PERSON> time to throw long passes to
receivers Art Monk, <PERSON>Gary Clark</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ricky Sanders</PERSON> (the protection has been so
effective that <PERSON>Rypien</PERSON> was sacked just nine times all season), but they are
also adept at knocking holes in defensive lines for backs <PERSON>Ernest Byner</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Ricky Ervins</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gerald Riggs</PERSON> to run through.
One big advantage the Redskins have is the versatility of their attack. The
Bills rely heavily, perhaps too heavily, on <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>'s all-round skills. Stop
<PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>, and <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> usually struggles.
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s three running backs possess different strengths and styles
providing a balance of power and precision. The trio of fleet wide receivers
spread defenses and regularly break open for long yardage. The variety of
attacking options available to Redskins coach <PERSON>Joe Gibbs</PERSON> helps explain why
his team was the highest-scoring unit in the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> this season.
Yet, as any fan of sports cliches knows, statistics and history mean little
when it comes to one Big Game. The difference may ultimately lie in
motivation, and how badly each team wants to win.
In this respect, the Bills could have the edge. It has been 363 days since
<PERSON>Scott Norwood</PERSON>'s potential game-winning kick sailed wide of the right hand
goalpost in the closing seconds of Superbowl XXV against the <ORGANIZATION>New York
Giants</ORGANIZATION>, and the determination of the Bills to avenge that loss burns just as
bright as it did a year ago.
Both teams have prepared thoroughly, but <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> seem to have gone about
their business amid the outrageous hype and publicity of Superbowl week in a
quieter, more purposeful manner.
And while less than half of the Redskins are survivors from the team's last
Superbowl appearance in <DATE>1987</DATE>, the Bills squad is much the same as it was
last year. The memories of that game are still fresh for <PERSON>Jim Kelly</PERSON>, <PERSON>Thurman
Thomas</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Bruce Smith</PERSON>. My money is on <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> to win by three points,
courtesy of kicker <PERSON>Scott Norwood</PERSON>.

Three fumbles in the game's first seven minutes <DATE>Sunday</DATE> gave <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION> Colt 
Coach <PERSON>Ron Meyer</PERSON> a mountainous problem. 
</P>
<P>
"As I said coming in, it looks like a very steep hill," <PERSON>Meyer</PERSON> said in reference 
to <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION>' playoff chances after a 30-7 loss to the <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bills. "It 
looks like Mount Everest right now." 
</P>
<P>
The Colts (4-6) are three games behind the first-place Bills (7-3) in the race 
for the AFC East title and two games behind second-place <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"It is best when you control your own destiny," Colts' offensive tackle <PERSON>Chris 
Hinton</PERSON> said. "But now we have to win the rest of our games and we also need 
some help from other teams if we are going to catch <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
The game's turning point may have come on the opening kickoff, when <PERSON>Mark Pike</PERSON> 
ripped the ball out of <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION> returner <PERSON>James Pruitt</PERSON>'s hands. <PERSON>Mickey 
Sutton</PERSON> recovered for <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> on the Colt 22-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
"That fumble was a big emotional lift for us," <PERSON>Sutton</PERSON> said. "Both teams came 
out all psyched up and that play set the tone for the whole game." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jim Kelly</PERSON> took advantage of the mistake, connecting with <PERSON>Thurman Thomas</PERSON> for the 
first of <ORGANIZATION>Kelly</ORGANIZATION>'s three touchdown passes on the day with only 2:12 gone in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
That fumble was forced by a hard hit. The Colts, especially running back <PERSON>Eric 
Dickerson</PERSON>, had no such excuse on the fumbles that ended their next two 
possessions. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Leonard Smith</PERSON> recovered <PERSON>Dickerson</PERSON>'s first fumble, giving <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> the ball at 
midfield, and <PERSON>Scott Norwood</PERSON> kicked a 42-yard field goal to make it 10-0. 
</P>
<P>
On the first play after the ensuing kickoff, <PERSON>Dickerson</PERSON>, who didn't talk to 
reporters after the game, fumbled again when the ball bounced off his knee. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills turned that into a 40-yard field goal by <ORGANIZATION>Norwood</ORGANIZATION> for a 13-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Touchdown passes of 32 and three yards from <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> to <PERSON>Andre Reed</PERSON> in the <DATE>second 
quarter</DATE> made it 27-0 at the half. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills rushed for 232 yards in 51 carries. Thomas had 127 yards in 29 
attempts.

<TEXT>     The Bills won't use it all the time or even most of the time. Their routine
is to strike quickly, keeping the defense off balance, grabbing control of the
game's tempo. That's what they did in a 51-3 rout of the Raiders on Sunday.;  
 That's exactly what they would like to do against the <ORGANIZATION>NFC</ORGANIZATION> champ <ORGANIZATION>New York
Giants</ORGANIZATION>. After all, scoring early is becoming a habit. The Bills have scored on
their first possession in nine of their past 12 games. Given that jump start,
they have scored a total of 95 points in two playoff games.;    "Once the
opponent sees us score so quickly on the first drive, which we've been doing a
lot lately, I think it gives our defense a psychological advantage," said
<LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> running back <PERSON>Thurman Thomas</PERSON>. "Now the other team is thinking that we
came out in a no-huddle and came right down and scored. It's a big morale
boost. People we play start thinking we can go up and down the field all
day.";    It was used against Bills;  The ironic part of the no-huddle offense
is that it was used effectively by the <LOCATION>Cincinnati Bengals</LOCATION> against the Bills
during the <DATE>1988</DATE> AFC championship game. Buffalo Coach <PERSON>Marv Levy</PERSON> protested
loudly before the game about the propriety of the no-huddle, where plays are
called at the line of scrimmage and defenses are not afforded time to make
adjustments.;    <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> won the game 21-10 and went to the Super Bowl. Now
Levy has used it to reach the Super Bowl.;    "They've been successful with
it," noted Giants defensive lineman <PERSON>Leonard Marshall</PERSON>. "They make you play a
lot of plays in a hurry. After so long playing that no-huddle, fatigue sets
in.;    "The key is to recognize the formation, remember your keys and make a
play. Once a play is over, you have to forget about it and get ready for the
next one. You don't have time to change up for different situations.";   
<LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> used the no-huddle offense some during a 17-13 regular-season victory
over the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Dec. 15</DATE>. <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> was able to learn from that game. The
Giants believe they can recognize what the Bills want to do from certain
formations, for instance, when they might run a crossing pattern with wide
receiver <PERSON>Andre Reed.</PERSON>;    <ORGANIZATION>Raiders</ORGANIZATION> tried a timeout;  There are a few ways to
break the momentum of the no-huddle. One is fake an injury. Another is call a
timeout, as <LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION> did less than two minutes into <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s game.;    "They
looked like they needed one," said <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON>. "We know if we don't prepare
correctly, <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> could put up a basketball score against us, too.";   
Preparation, say the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>, is only half the battle. Reacting to what they
see on the field is the rest.;    "First you have to make sure you have
everybody lined up," said linebacker <PERSON>Carl Banks</PERSON>. "Second, you have to have
your signals called. Third, you have to have your defensive linemen down. If
they're standing up looking for a call, it's all over.";    The no-huddle
offense has one drawback. It takes practically no time off the clock. The
Bills' first touchdown came in 3 1/2 minutes.;    But that is a small price to
pay for momentum.;    <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>Bill Parcells</PERSON> is less worried about the
philosophy than the personnel.;    "It's not what they're doing, it's who's
doing it," <PERSON>Parcells</PERSON> said. "The no-huddle is a nice, vogue thing to write
about. But their offense is <PERSON>Andre Reed</PERSON> and <PERSON>Thurman Thomas</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jim Kelly</PERSON>. Those
are the guys you have to stop. You don't stop the no-huddle.;    "You stop
their wide receivers, and they can't throw. You stop their runners and they
can't run."  </TEXT>

<MEMO>  The NFL / Week 5; Additional information attached to the end of this article.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Kelly threw for 303 yards and three touchdowns and the Bills came back from
a sluggish first half to score 35 points in the final 32 minutes to beat the
<ORGANIZATION>Chicago Bears</ORGANIZATION> 35-20 in a battle of undefeated NFL teams.;   "When the clock is
running down on us, it seems to get us going," center <PERSON>Kent Hull</PERSON> said. "It's an
offense that seems to thrive under pressure and not do so well when there
isn't much.";   There wasn't much pressure at the start for the Bills, who had
scored 87 points in two home wins, then just 41 in two victories on the road.;
  In the first 28 minutes they had the ball for just six minutes, had 38 yards
on offense and were lucky to be trailing 6-0 -- the Bears had two touchdowns
called back by penalties and had to settle for <PERSON>Kevin Butler</PERSON> field goals of 28
and 42 yards.;   In the last 32 minutes, the Bills had the ball for 19 minutes
and rolled up 381 yards.;   It started with 1 minute, 59 seconds left in the
first half and <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> on its own 15.;   The Bills were in the end zone 1:47
later, the result of a 33-yard strike from <LOCATION>Kelly</LOCATION> to <PERSON>Al Edwards</PERSON>. That gave the
Bills a largely undeserved 7-6 lead, setting them off on an offensive
explosion that improved them to 5-0 and dropped <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> to 4-1;   "We got our
butts beat, that is all you can say about it," <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> coach <PERSON>Mike Ditka</PERSON> said.
"We had a number of chances in the game and we seemed to self-destruct every
chance we had. I give them all the credit in the world.";   The defending AFC
champion Bills (5-0) have won 12 games in a row, including the playoffs, at
home. Their last loss at Rich Stadium was in <DATE>November</DATE>, 1989.;   "They are a
fine football team; they taught us a little lesson," <PERSON>Ditka</PERSON> said. "Hopefully,
when you are in football, you learn from the lessons that are taught to you,
and you carry on from there.";   The Bills drove 91 yards for a touchdown to
open the second half -- <PERSON>Carwell Gardner</PERSON>'s fourth-down recovery of his own
fumble from a yard out in the end zone. The drive started with runs of 12, 9
and 19 by <PERSON>Thurman Thomas</PERSON>, who got 90 of his 117 rushing yards after
intermission.;   "We didn't expect them to run like that," <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> linebacker
<PERSON>Ron Rivera</PERSON> said. "They ended the first half throwing the ball and we thought
that would be their mode of operation coming out.";   <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> agreed, saying the
key was a misdirection play which set Thomas free for those first three runs.;
  "Thurman opened it up," <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> said. "We had a couple of running plays we
didn't use in the first half. The misdirection was one of them."; BILLS 35,
BEARS 20;   (box) THE HERO: <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> quarterback <PERSON>Jim Kelly</PERSON> threw for 303 yards
and three touchdowns, and the Bills scored 35 points in the final 32 minutes.;
  (box) THE GOAT: Bears quarterback <PERSON>Jim Harbaugh</PERSON>, who completed only 6 of 16
passes in the second half.;   (box) KEY PLAY: Trailing 6-0 after being
completely outplayed for the first 29-plus minutes, the Bills took the lead
for good on a 33-yard touchdown pass from <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> to <PERSON>Al Edwards</PERSON> with 12 seconds
remaining in the first half.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  This guy can beat you in so many ways. That kind of statement is usually made
about shortstops who bat .220 but have a lot of spirit.;    But when a pro

Mercury News Staff Writer Ric Bucher contributed to this report.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Actually, <LOCATION>L.T.</LOCATION> was just fooling around, but a lot of folks in <LOCATION>Jersey</LOCATION> would
probably give you a good argument about his ability to step in wherever he is
needed.;  DON'T DARE BE LATE; <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>Marv Levy</PERSON> was quizzed about the
various ways he may approach the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s Super Bowl.;    Levy
referred to remarks he said were made before a bout between legendary
heavyweight champion <PERSON>Joe Louis</PERSON> and challenger <PERSON>Billy Conn</PERSON>:;    "When they asked
<PERSON>Billy</PERSON>, he talked about how he was going to bob and weave and everything else
he planned to do," <PERSON>Levy</PERSON> said. "Then they asked <PERSON>Joe Louis</PERSON>, who said, 'I'll be
there, and I'll be on time.' Well, that's what we're going to do. We'll be
there, and we'll be on time.";  THE THRILL OF IT ALL; <ORGANIZATION>New York Giants</ORGANIZATION> Coach
<PERSON>Bill Parcells</PERSON>, asked to recall the most memorable moment from his team's first
trip to the Super Bowl in <DATE>1987</DATE>, said it was waiting to take the field. The
game, in which the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> defeated <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> 39-20, was played in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>'s Rose
Bowl.;    "I think probably the thing most difficult to explain to anyone is
the thrill of standing in that tunnel waiting to go out . . . and feeling that
exhilaration that comes over you, the feeling that, for one day, you're on
center stage.";  THAT'S A WRAP; Let the quarterback controversy begin.;   
Asked whether injured <PERSON>Phil Simms</PERSON> or super backup <PERSON>Jeff Hostetler</PERSON> would be his
starting quarterback next season, <PERSON>Parcells</PERSON> said, "We'll see in training camp.
I go by what I see. I'll play the best guys." . . .;    <PERSON>Parcells</PERSON> had his
running backs practice wearing uniform numbers in the 90s <DATE>Thursday</DATE> to foil any
potential spies. Asked what he would have them wear <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <PERSON>Parcells</PERSON> said,
smiling, "They're wearing all blanks today. Think that's a sign of paranoia?"
. . .;    The Bills had their first curfew of any kind <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, which <PERSON>Levy</PERSON>
said was a 12:30 a.m. "honor" curfew. He said he had no idea if anyone missed
it. The Bills' curfew for <DATE>Friday</DATE> and tonight is 11 p.m.;  <LOCATION>AMERICA</LOCATION>'S FAVORITE
CELEBS; CAN'T DECIDE WHO WILL WIN; No real scholarly look at the Super Bowl
would be complete without a poll of celebrities. So, here goes:;    <PERSON>Morganna
Roberts</PERSON>, the entertainer who made a career out of running out onto playing
fields and kissing athletes:;    "Sure, I know who's in the Super Bowl -- the
Bills and <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>. I'm praying for the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> because <PERSON>Lawrence Taylor</PERSON> and I did
a card show together and he's a very nice man. But I've known <PERSON>Jim Kelly</PERSON> for
years. He used to come see me when I danced in a club in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> and he was
with the <ORGANIZATION>Houston Gamblers</ORGANIZATION> (of the USFL). He's such a nice person. So I guess
I'll have to root for the Bills.";    <LOCATION>Cal Ripken</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> Orioles
shortstop:;    "<LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>, 17-10. The Bills are playing so well, they remind you
of the 49ers. . . . But if there's one thing that could stop <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>, it would
be a good defense like the Giants.";    <ORGANIZATION>Andie MacDowell</ORGANIZATION>, actress-model:;   
"I'm proud of both the teams from my adopted home state, but it will
definitely be the <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bills by at least 10 points. Their offense is too
much and they have a really sound defense anchored by No. 78. I can't remember
his name, but he's great.";    <PERSON>Johnny Bench</PERSON>, former <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> catcher:;    "I
like <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> because the Bills can score. The offense of the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> has
revolved around their defense. Buffalo scored 95 points in two weeks and you
might think that 21 points will win the Super Bowl. I think <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> has shown
it can score 21 points easier than the Giants.";    <PERSON>Dr. Ruth Westheimer</PERSON>, sex
therapist: "The Giants will win because of the momentum they got in their big
win against <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.";    <PERSON>Charles Grodin</PERSON>, actor:;    "I believe the
<ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> will win the Super Bowl, because those of us who live in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>
don't need anymore bad news.";    <PERSON>Jim Leyland</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Pittsburgh Pirates</LOCATION> manager:;   
"<LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>, 16-13. I'm a little nervous about that pick because the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> have
been there before. But <PERSON>Thurman Thomas</PERSON> will be the difference because he can
run and catch so well he will keep <PERSON>Lawrence Taylor</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> defense off
balance.";    <PERSON>Eddie Murray</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> Dodgers first baseman:;    "I don't
want to make <PERSON>Lawrence Taylor</PERSON> mad, but <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>'s offense and defense is really
on a roll. Without a two-week layoff, they will continue to roll. The Giant
defense is tough, but I'd rather have my No. 1 quarterback (<PERSON>Jim Kelly</PERSON>) than a
backup (<PERSON>Jeff Hostetler</PERSON>) in the big game.";    <PERSON>Dick Vitale</PERSON>, sportscaster:;   
"<LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> 24-17. <PERSON>Jim Kelly</PERSON> -- too tough. <PERSON>Bruce Smith</PERSON> -- best defensive player
in football. Move over <PERSON>Lawrence Taylor</PERSON>, baa-bee. It's not your day <DATE>today</DATE>.";   
<PERSON>Scott Hamilton</PERSON>, ice skater:;    "I would say <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>. They've been the
wretched refugees in the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> for too long, and an <ORGANIZATION>AFC</ORGANIZATION> team hasn't won a Super
Bowl in a while. It's time.";    <PERSON>Larry King</PERSON>, talk show host:;    "<LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>
23-10 in a very good game. I pick <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> because they finished the season as
the absolute best team in football. They're a team that comes along once in a
blue moon. Besides, I picked them to win the Super Bowl before the season
began.";    <PERSON>Beano Cook</PERSON>, TV analyst:;    "<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Giants 42, <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bills 10.
If the 49ers show up, <LOCATION>San Francisco 49</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> 10. The AFC is still the Ivy
League of pro football.";    <PERSON>Jerry Mathers</PERSON>, TV child star:;    "I got wiped
out. I'm a Raiders person. I'm totally cleaned out. If I had to go with one,
it would be the Giants.";    <PERSON>Toni Tennille</PERSON>, singer:;    "When the Niners were
out of it, I kind of lost interest. Probably the Bills.";     <PERSON>Dr. Joyce
Brothers</PERSON>, psychologist:;    "The Giants are going to win without question;
reason being that they have an excellent defense. Additionally, the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>
play a slowdown game and keep running the clock, and there is nothing that
drives people bananas as much as that. Understand, Americans tend to be
action-oriented, and a great psychological defense is slowing down the game.
Also, <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> is not good on the road, and they're going to be disoriented,
though not as disoriented as they'll be by the slow tempo."OK, that's it. Stop
the music, stop the music.  </TEXT>

<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>New England Patriots</ORGANIZATION> have had plenty of practice coming from behind. For 
once, they got it right. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie cornerback <PERSON>Maurice Hurst</PERSON> put the Patriots ahead to stay on a 16-yard 
interception return with 2:49 left as <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> scored 20 points in the <DATE>last 
eight minutes Sunday</DATE> to beat the <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bills, 33-24. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably our largest play of the year," <PERSON>Hurst</PERSON> said. "I thought first 
about catching it and then when I saw the end zone I just couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots turned two mistakes by <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> quarterback <PERSON>Jim Kelly</PERSON> into the 
decisive points. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst's touchdown on a pass by <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> gave the Patriots (4-7) a 30-24 lead and 
<PERSON>Jason Staurovsky</PERSON> added a clinching 38-yard field goal after <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> 
recovered a fumble by <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> at the Patriot 31. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo (7-4) fell into a tie for the <ORGANIZATION>AFC East</ORGANIZATION> lead with <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the Patriots overcame a <DATE>24-12 fourth-quarter</DATE> deficit to take a 
26-24 lead over the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Jets, only to lose, 27-26, on <PERSON>Pat Leahy</PERSON>'s 
final-play field goal. A week ago, they nearly erased a 28-10 deficit with two 
touchdowns in the last four minutes but lost to <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>, 28-24. 
</P>
<P>
"We know any time we play them we're in a fight," <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> said. "We know they can 
come back. We know what kind of a quarterback <PERSON>Steve Grogan</PERSON> is." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly completed 21 of 41 passes for 356 yards, one touchdown and two 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
After <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> took a 24-13 lead on <PERSON>Larry Kinnebrew</PERSON>'s one-yard touchdown run and 
<PERSON>Thurman Thomas</PERSON>' 25-yard scoring pass from <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON>, <PERSON>Grogan</PERSON> began the comeback with 
a 14-yard touchdown pass to <PERSON>Hart Lee Dykes</PERSON> with 7:45 left. 
</P>
<P>
Staurovsky's 34-yard field goal made it 24-23 with 3:06 left. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> snapped a two-game losing streak with a season-best 192-yard ground 
attack, led by <PERSON>John Stephens</PERSON>' 126 yards in 23 carries. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots erased a 10-6 halftime deficit on a 15-yard scoring run by rookie 
<PERSON>Patrick Egu</PERSON> on his first NFL carry. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo took a 7-0 lead on its first series of the game on <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>' three-yard 
run. Staurovsky kicked field goals of 34 and 24 yards, cutting the lead to 7-6 
with 7:04 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills' <PERSON>Scott Norwood</PERSON> kicked a 31-yard field goal with 35 seconds left in 
the first half.

<LEADPARA>  The New York Giants have an old-style offense, a new-wave defense and, as of
Sunday evening, another Super Bowl championship.;    Using a combination of
turf-churning runs by Ottis Anderson, the game's most valuable player, and an
innovative defensive scheme featuring five or six defensive backs and two down
linemen, the Giants squeezed past the Buffalo Bills 20-19 to claim their

<TEXT>     But before the victory in Super Bowl XXV was locked up, they had to survive
a 47-yard field-goal attempt by the Bills' <PERSON>Scott Norwood</PERSON>, whose chance to be a
hero went wide right with eight seconds to play.;    On their way to victory,
the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> broke records both very old and very new.;    The old:;    (check)
The one-point victory broke the record for narrowest margin of victory, three
points, set in Super Bowl V.;    The new:;    (check) Their ground-hugging
offense held the ball for 40 minutes, 33 seconds of the 60-minute contest,
breaking the 49ers' possession record (39:31) set in Super Bowl XXIV. And
their <DATE>third-quarter</DATE> touchdown drive that lasted 9:29 and ended with a 1-yard
dive by <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> set the record for longest TD drive. The previous mark, 7:07,
had been set by the <ORGANIZATION>Niners</ORGANIZATION>, too.;    "Those drives were real important,
because it kept their offense off the field and, just as importantly, it kept
their defense on it," said cornerback <PERSON>Mark Collins</PERSON>. "They're not used to being
on the field for that long. You could see it on those long drives that they
were getting tired.";    "We're not pretty, but we're effective," said
<PERSON>Anderson</PERSON>, who carried 21 times for 102 yards and one TD.;    Any talk before
the game about a fatigue factor involved the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>' defense. Expectations
were that the Bills' no-huddle offense would run the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>' 3-4 defense
ragged.;    Maybe it would have. Defensive coordinator <PERSON>Bill Belichick</PERSON> didn't
want to find out, so he switched to a nickel defense and had defensive back
<ORGANIZATION>Everson Walls</ORGANIZATION> calling defensive audibles to match any from Bills quarterback
<PERSON>Jim Kelly.</PERSON>;    "We wanted to have more speed and better athletes on the
field," <PERSON>Belichick</PERSON> explained. "We thought their big-play guys would be <PERSON>James
Lofton</PERSON>, <PERSON>Andre Reed</PERSON> and <PERSON>Thurman Thomas. . . . Everson</PERSON> did a hell of a job. He
called it better than I could have.";    Despite all that, the Bills, heavily
favored after scoring 95 points in their two playoff games, still could have
pulled it out. An 11-yard run by <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> had put the ball on the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION><DATE>' 29</DATE>,
where <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> spiked the ball to stop the clock with eight seconds left and give
the Bills a chance to bring on Norwood.;    "Everything was fine with
placement," <PERSON>Norwood</PERSON> said. "It was a matter of trying to put a little too much
on the kick.";    <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> place-kicker <PERSON>Matt Bahr</PERSON>, who had put his team in the
Super Bowl by making a last-second field goal from 42 yards in the <ORGANIZATION>NFC</ORGANIZATION>
championship game against the 49ers, sympathized.;    "That's a difficult kick
in any conditions," <PERSON>Bahr</PERSON> said. "It was more nerve wracking to be on the
sidelines. Everything was a blur. I didn't really watch it. When I saw
(cornerback) <PERSON>Roger Brown</PERSON> jumping up and down, I knew it had missed.";   
Giants defensive end <PERSON>Leonard Marshall</PERSON> didn't see it either, because he was
lost in thinking back over the last three months.;    "I thought about
everything," he said. "I thought about beating <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> 20-0 and only beating
New England 13-10 and having everyone say we weren't going to make it. I
thought about beating <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, training camp, all the different snaps.";    He
didn't mention the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>' 17-13 loss to the Bills in the regular season. But
sloppy tackling, the same problem that plagued the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> when they lost to
the Bills during the regular season, cost them a 17-12 lead at the start of
the fourth quarter.;    <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>, on the first play of the quarter, shed
linebacker <PERSON>Gary Reasons</PERSON> and safety <PERSON>Myron Guyton</PERSON> on his way to a 31-yard
touchdown run. Norwood's extra point made it <DATE>19-17</DATE>, Bills.;    But the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>
came back with another time-consuming drive, using up 7:32 as they went from
their 23 to the <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> 3. Bahr kicked a 21-yard field goal that gave them a

<PERSON>Warren Moon</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jim Kelly</PERSON> played to a virtual standoff, but the <ORGANIZATION>Houston Oilers</ORGANIZATION> 
surprisingly had the edge when it came to <LOCATION>Lorenzo White</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Thurman Thomas</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
White had his career-best game for rushing and receiving yardage <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, 
leading the Oilers past the <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bills, 27-24, and completing a week in 
which all six <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> division leaders lost. 
</P>
<P>
"Our offensive line was ferocious and unrelenting," White said. "It takes a 
while for the line in this system to get used to the run. Once I get the hole I 
can create things. It was just like it's drawn up on the board." 
</P>
<P>
Houston (6-5) created a three-way tie with <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> for the 
AFC Central lead, while the Bills (9-2), whose eight-game losing streak was 
ended, dropped into a tie for the <ORGANIZATION>AFC East</ORGANIZATION> lead with <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
White rushed 18 times for 125 yards and caught five passes for 89 yards. His 
previous best rushing total was 113 and his best receiving was 82, both last 
season. Thomas was held to 54 yards in 15 carries and caught four passes for 32 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"They were in pass defense most of the night," <PERSON>Pardee</PERSON> said. "They had six guys 
back and five up front. You have to be able to count. We got White going." 
</P>
<P>
White, who has taken heat for his fumbles and lack of production this season, 
"was wired tight," <PERSON>Pardee</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Moon</PERSON>'s 28-yard pass to White positioned the Oilers for a three-yard scoring 
pass to <PERSON>Leonard Harris</PERSON>, giving <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> a 27-17 lead with 7:21 left. 
</P>
<P>
"White was fantastic," <PERSON>Moon</PERSON> said. "He knew he was going to be called upon the 
way they were dropping people back." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas scored on a two-yard run with 3:29 left to trim <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>'s lead, but the 
Oilers ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Moon completed 16 of 22 passes for 300 yards and two touchdowns; <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> was 23 
of 34 for 224 yards and two scores. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew it would be a matter of who had the ball last," <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> said. "We had 
confidence we could score again. But give them credit." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Moon</PERSON>'s 43-yard pass to Drew Hill set up White's one-yard run with 3:14 left in 
the <DATE>third quarter</DATE> to give the Oilers a <DATE>20-17</DATE> lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills weren't overly complimentary of White. 
</P>
<P>
"When we're split out like we were, a baby could run through the holes," 
cornerback <PERSON>Nate Odomes</PERSON> said. "I don't mean to take anything away from <LOCATION>Lorenzo</LOCATION>. 
My hat is off to him." 
</P>

Kelly gave the Bills a 14-13 lead by hitting <PERSON>Keith McKeller</PERSON> with an 11-yard 
scoring pass 40 seconds before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Scott Norwood</PERSON>'s 43-yard field goal made it 17-13 on <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>'s first possession

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- On Sports:
   Bills on a Stampede Toward Minneapolis
   ----
   By Frederick C. Klein

<LP>
   Orchard Park, N.Y. -- The question of who wants to spend a
late-January week in Minneapolis was bound to arise as the
National Football League playoffs unfolded, and last weekend
four volunteers stepped forward. In the National Conference,
the Washington Redskins slogged through home-field muck to
beat the Atlanta Falcons, and the upstart Detroit Lions
survived the air conditioning of their Pontiac Silverdome
against the Dallas Cowboys. In the American Conference, John
Elway again walked on figurative water to give his Denver
Broncos a chance for a Super Bowl trip to the big Metrodome
igloo, and the Buffalo Bills bashed the Kansas City Chiefs on
a chilly, graywrapped Sunday here.
   Of the four winners, none made a more emphatic statement
of their intention to be Minny-bound than the Bills. Their
victory over the Chiefs was by a 37-14 score in a game in
which the last quarter-and-a-half was a mere formality.
Moments after Jim Kelly, the thick-necked quarterback, found
James Lofton, the long-legged receiver, with a 10-yard
touchdown pass to make it 24-0 three minutes into period
three, 11 folks in the east stand of crowded Rich Stadium
cheerily arose holding big red letters spelling out
"MINNEAPOLIS." It is tempting to insert a Buffalo joke here,
but, given other circumstances, fans in Miami or L.A. would
be glad to be in the shoes of the Buffaloans, even if they
are fur-lined.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Bills, you'll recall, were a Super Bowl visitor last
year. They lost to the <ORGANIZATION>New York Giants</ORGANIZATION>, <DATE>20-19</DATE>, when a field
goal try by their <PERSON>Scott Norwood</PERSON> went awry. That was in toasty
<LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, the sort of tropical venue usually selected for
those affairs. But the boys from <ORGANIZATION>Nickel City</ORGANIZATION> will be glad to
swap a chance at a tan for a trophy this time around. "Yeah,
we know where the game is; we've been pointing for it all
season," said <PERSON>Cornelius Bennett</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> linebacker. "We
can go someplace warm after we win." To be sure, that will
take some doing in a saga that resumes with the <ORGANIZATION>AFC</ORGANIZATION> final
here <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. The Bills' foe will be <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>, which gave the
<ORGANIZATION>Houston Oilers Broncoitis</ORGANIZATION> with an 87-yard, no-timeouts-left
drive to set up a last-play field goal and 26-24 victory.
Elway, the <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> quarterback, engineers such miracles
routinely, a fact that's well known to the Bills. "The
difference between <PERSON>Elway</PERSON> and <PERSON>DeBerg</PERSON> and Vlasic {the Chief
QBs} is like night and day," said <PERSON>Leon Seals</PERSON>, an undiplomatic
but accurate <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> defensive lineman.
   But as they've amply displayed all season, the Bills have
quite a few assets of their own, including a state-of-the-art
offense that was No. 1 in yards and No. 2 in points over the
regular campaign. They run and shoot from the spread out,
multireceiver formation of the same name, and do it quick,
sans huddles. In the process, they've debunked the curious
but widespread notion that owning the ball over long periods
(the stat is called "time of possession") is somehow
important in the great scheme of things.
   <PERSON>Marv Levy</PERSON>, the sometime scholar who coaches this crew (he
holds a master's degree in English history from the U. of
<LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>), says the magic isn't in how you line up but in what
you do thereafter, and the Bills are solvent there, too. In
QB <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON>, they have a strong-armed type who is now, in his
sixth NFL (and eighth pro) season, strong-minded as well,
able to change plays nimbly at the line of scrimmage. In
sure-footed <PERSON>Thurman Thomas</PERSON>, they have the league's best
all-purpose back, with the stats to prove it. And in the
veterans <PERSON>Lofton</PERSON>, <PERSON>Andre Reed</PERSON> and <PERSON>Don Beebe</PERSON>, they have swift
receivers who are difficult to pass, as in exceed. "It's hard
to cover any of us one-on-one, and, on most plays, somebody
has to do that," noted <ORGANIZATION>Reed</ORGANIZATION>, who caught passes worth 1,113
yards this term.
   <PERSON>Jayice Pearson</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION> cornerback, found himself
trying to guard <PERSON>Reed</PERSON> one-on-one twice in the <DATE>first half
Sunday</DATE>, and both times wound up watching <ORGANIZATION>Reed</ORGANIZATION>'s No. 83
recede. The first touchdown pass Reed caught covered 25
yards, the second 53, and they put the Chiefs in permanent
arrears.
   "We caught them in the wrong coverage at the wrong time,"
grinned Reed. That happened a lot on a day in which <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON>
completed 23 of 35 passes for 273 yards, and <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>'s rushing
yardage totaled a round 100.
   The other team gets the ball once in awhile too, and the
last time these two teams met, in <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION> on <DATE>Oct. 7</DATE>, the
<LOCATION>Chiefs</LOCATION> did very well with it. They have the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>'s most
predictable offense, preferring to run straight ahead under
most circumstances, but sometimes it works, and it did for
247 yards rushing in a 33-6 Chief win. And, in fact, the
Bills' defense has been suspect generally, ranking 27th among
the league's 28 clubs.
   But injuries -- especially one to <PERSON>Bruce Smith</PERSON>, their
massive defensive lineman -- played a role in that showing,
and <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> was back <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, albeit with continuing difficulty
from a sore knee. Whatever, KC could run for just 77 yards
this time, and the Bills intercepted four passes thrown by
young QB <PERSON>Mark Vlasic</PERSON>, who replaced the veteran <PERSON>Steve DeBerg</PERSON>
after the latter sprained his thumb on the helmet of a Bill
lineman. The Chiefs could not advance into <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> territory
until they did so via an intercepted pass late in period
three, and trailed by 30, 37-7, at one point.
   The early season loss to the Chiefs was one of just three
inflicted upon the Bills this season (they have won 14), but
Coach <PERSON>Levy</PERSON> said afterward that advancement, not revenge, was
their prime motivation on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. He adjudged their overall
performance to be their best of the season, and said he
believed it stemmed from the "heightened degree of perception
and awareness" that playoff football inspires.
   If he talks like that to the Bills, and they understand
it, there's no telling how far they can go. Certainly as far
as <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>.

   Where the Buffaloes Roam

   Russell Springs, Kan. -- The two hunters left the warmth
of the campfire in the grove of towering cottonwoods and
stepped out onto the vastness of the native prairie. A
serpentine path led them around the pointed leaves of yucca
cactus, around brittle sagebrush and impenetrable clusters of
tumbleweed.
   As they walked across the calm, sundrenched grassland I
noticed that one of the pair was shaking. "Cold?" I asked.
"No," he replied, "excited to be here." Not a sportsman in
the world could blame him.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> prairie that surrounded him is home to some of
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s most magnificent whitetail and mule deer. Where the
habitat is right there are antelopes, wild turkeys and
countless coveys of quails and pheasants. Without a doubt,
it's some of the finest game country that can be found today.
   Yet the hunters were looking for a hunt of the past rather
than the present. The short walk that took them to the top of
a small rise, in a way, took them back a dozen decades or
more. It was then that they saw it -- a half-ton, humpbacked
animal cloaked in a thick brown and chestnut coat, wearing a
pair of short, ebony horns on its massive head.
   A stalk was planned and the hunters were off. Though
unusual in modern times, a buffalo hunt is something that the
plains above the <LOCATION>Smokey Hill River</LOCATION> had seen countless times
through the centuries.
   "This used to be some of the finest buffalo country in
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>," said <PERSON>Wilbur Williams</PERSON>, as he looked out over the
prairies of his <ORGANIZATION>Smoky River Buffalo Ranch</ORGANIZATION>, which offers
guided hunting expeditions. The main season runs from
<DATE>November</DATE> through <DATE>March</DATE>. "They were here in the millions; old
accounts tell of herds stretching as far as the eye could
see."
   And according to <PERSON>Mr. Williams</PERSON>, a self-trained naturalist
and historian, the vast herd attracted a variety of hunters
throughout the centuries. While roaming the ranch as both a
boy and a man, <PERSON>Mr. Williams</PERSON> has found tools and weapons from
such past hunters as the Pawnee, <LOCATION>Cheyenne</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Arapaho</LOCATION> tribes.
   The grounds that now make up his buffalo ranch were
utilized by white hunters as well. Trappers headed for the
mountains and travelers headed for the promise of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
or <ORGANIZATION>Oregon</ORGANIZATION> relied on the buffalo for a source of food. Those
who followed, however, relied on them as a source for
money-making hides.
   "This area was at the heart of the big buffalo-hunting era
of the late 1860s and <DATE>1870s</DATE>," said <PERSON>Mr. Williams</PERSON>. "There was a
lot of history made around here. Bill Cody and <PERSON>Bill Comstock</PERSON>
had their famous buffalo-hunting contest just north of here
to see who could use the name Buffalo Bill. And over the
years I've found at least two shoe boxes full of old
cartridges left behind by the hide hunters."
   The original herds and the hide hunters disappeared
roughly a century ago. A lifelong love of the big animals
caused <PERSON>Mr. Williams</PERSON> to bring them back. With a careful
breeding program and supplementation, the native Kansan has
reestablished a self-sustaining herd here. And the hunters
have returned, hunting an experience, trying to relive a life
of old.
   "The main reason I came was to fulfill a lifelong dream,"
said <PERSON>Darrell Wuertz</PERSON>, one of the pair of hunters. "Ever since
I was little I dreamed about walking the ground where the
buffalo lived and taking one with a black-powder rifle in the
way that the mountain men would have so many years ago. For
someone like me, just being here is worth the drive from
<LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>."
   That weekend eight hunters from a halfdozen states had
traveled to <PERSON>Mr. Williams</PERSON>'s ranch for the same reasons as <PERSON>Mr.
Wuertz</PERSON>. All but one hunted with replicas of original
percussion or flintlock muzzleloaders, most of which they'd
built with their own hands. Some even walked the plains in
buckskin clothing.
   Other groups have pitched tepees and camped among the
cottonwoods. <PERSON>Mr. Williams</PERSON> contributes to the realism by
serving meals of buffalo around an open campfire. He and his
assistants wear dress of the period, and hunters who choose
to can hunt with one of <PERSON>Mr. Williams</PERSON>'s original Sharps
"buffalo rifles."
   No matter what the gun of choice, those who come meet with
success. Though an animal of surprising quickness and speed,
the buffalo has never been as challenging as, say, whitetail
deer. The two hunters eventually were able to sneak within
range in the midst of the expansive prairie. Roy English was
first to fire and <PERSON>Mr. Wuertz</PERSON> was quick to add a humane
insurance shot.
   But the day was far from over for Messrs. English and
<PERSON>Wuertz</PERSON>. They, <PERSON>Mr. Williams</PERSON> and an associate labored far into
the afternoon. When they were done they had the skin removed
and readied to be made into a massive buffalo robe. More
importantly, the meat was trimmed and ready for the trip back
to <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>.
   "That's another big reason why we came," said <PERSON>Mr. English</PERSON>.
"We're going to be taking home meat and you can bet we're
going to use it all."
   The two hunters will not only be eating a lot, they'll
also be eating well. According to <PERSON>Mr. Williams</PERSON>, the
three-year-old bull will produce close to 500 pounds of
superbly delicious meat. As an added bonus, it's a meat that
the hunters can feast on to their heart's content. "Buffalo
is a meat that's high in protein but very lean," said <PERSON>Mr.
Williams</PERSON>. "It's not zero-percent cholesterol, but it's much
less than beef. It's a very healthy meat."

<P>
When they won the game in the first half, the <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bills looked like a <LOCATION>San 
Francisco</LOCATION> 49er team playing the no-huddle offense. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>'s best defensive player, <PERSON>Bruce Smith</PERSON>, resembling the 
old <PERSON>Lawrence Taylor</PERSON>, broke down the <ORGANIZATION>New York Giants</ORGANIZATION>' offense. 
</P>
<P>
Then both teams lost their quarterbacks -- possibly for the season -- whereupon 
the Bills hung on to get a 17-13 victory <DATE>Saturday</DATE> in a matchup that was billed 
in nearby <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> as a Super Bowl preview. 
</P>
<P>
It might not be remembered as that unless the two quarterbacks return. 
</P>
<P>
On a chilly, rainy day in <LOCATION>Giants Stadium</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Jim Kelly</PERSON> went down first, 
leaving late in the first half with damaged knee ligaments that could require 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be out three weeks unless I'm lucky," he kept saying. 
</P>
<P>
In the <DATE>third quarter</DATE>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Phil Simms</PERSON> went to the bench with a sprained 
arch, which, the doctors said, can be more serious than it sounds or looks. 
</P>
<P>
"The good news is that the <PERSON>Simms</PERSON> X-rays were negative," Giant Coach <PERSON>Bill 
Parcells</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
It was about the only good news the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> had in the course of slipping to 
11-3 in the highly competitive NFC. They had entered <DATE>December 10-0</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills advanced to 12-2 when they survived a second-half battle of backup 
quarterbacks, a struggle in which <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Frank Reich</PERSON> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Jeff 
Hostetler</PERSON> moved their teams repeatedly though scoring only three points apiece. 
</P>
<P>
After <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> had outplayed <PERSON>Simms</PERSON> in a 14-10 first half, <PERSON>Hostetler</PERSON>'s 
<DATE>third-quarter</DATE> drive improved the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> to 14-13. 
</P>
<P>
That put it up to <PERSON>Reich</PERSON>, who, on the game's next series, drove the Bills to the 
three points that got <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> in position to win, <DATE>17-13</DATE>, unless <PERSON>Hostetler</PERSON> could 
take the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> to a <DATE>fourth-quarter</DATE> touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't his fault that he couldn't. On one possession he came down to the 
<LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> 13, where, in shotgun formation on third down, <ORGANIZATION>Giant</ORGANIZATION> center <PERSON>Bart Oates</PERSON> 
took his club out of field goal range with a wild snap. 
</P>
<P>
Next, reaching the <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> 21 on a 17-yard pass to wide receiver <PERSON>Stephen Baker</PERSON>, 
<PERSON>Hostetler</PERSON> lost all that, and 10 yards more, on offensive pass interference 
against a decoy receiver who was across the field from <PERSON>Baker</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"We must have had 10 opportunities to (win) this one and blew them all," 
<PERSON>Parcells</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Giant linebacker <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON>, for example, was in position to score two touchdowns 
on intercepted passes. 
</P>
<P>
"I just couldn't make the plays," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thus he was outplayed by <PERSON>Smith</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>'s 275-pound defensive end, who had 
promised he would. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't knocking <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> last week when I said I'm better than he is," <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"My full statement was this: Over the <DATE>last 10 years</DATE>, <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> was the most 
dominant defensive player in the game. This season, I have emerged to be the 
best." 
</P>
<P>
On <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON>'s own turf, it looked that way. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills, however, have played good defense for years. What's different about 
this team is that it's also playing good offense. 
</P>
<P>
Coach <PERSON>Marv Levy</PERSON> and his offensive coordinator, <PERSON>Ted Marchibroda</PERSON>, have given 
<LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> a well-structured short-passing attack that resembles <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s. 
In fact, it proved more successful against <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> than <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s -- 
which had been held to one touchdown <DATE>Dec. 3</DATE> in the 49ers' 7-3 victory over the 
<ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
There were two reasons for that: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Most <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> plays were dispatched from no-huddle formations that kept the 
Giants off balance throughout most of <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON>'s time on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Bills' main ballcarrier, <PERSON>Thurman Thomas</PERSON>, demonstrated again that he is 
one of the league's quickest. Though weighing less than 200 pounds, <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> 
obliged the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> to put more men on him than they had put on any 49er running 
back earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
A year or two ago, the <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> offense was as conservative as the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>' still 
is. 
</P>
<P>
"We've evolved into this gradually," <PERSON>Levy</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"We can play a more (wide open) game now because we have the people to do it -- 
especially a big tight end who can catch the ball, <PERSON>Keith McKeller</PERSON>, not to 
mention (wide receivers) <PERSON>Andre Reed</PERSON>, <PERSON>James Lofton</PERSON> and <PERSON>Don Beebe</PERSON>." 
</P>
<P>
Said <ORGANIZATION>Buffalo General Manager Bill Polian</ORGANIZATION>: "We decided in the off-season that we 
have the personnel to open up in the no-huddle offense." 
</P>
<P>
In other years, the Bills haven't really integrated pass plays into their 
run-oriented offense until the playoffs, when it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
The way they passed in the first half won a big game. On successive series, 
<PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> led the Bills 76 and 78 yards to short-yardage touchdowns -- throwing 
sometimes from shotgun formation on first down and moving the team as a rule 
with no-huddle plays. 
</P>
<P>
"We have what it takes to run the no-huddle now," <PERSON>Levy</PERSON> said. "We can leave our 
regular personnel on the field and throw the ball in power formations." 
</P>
<P>
Reed scored the first touchdown on a six-yard pass and <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> the second when 
he cut inside <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> on a two-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> had begun the game by plodding 71 yards on the ground to a 
fourth-and-a-foot touchdown by halfback <PERSON>Ottis Anderson</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Thereafter, finally replacing <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON>, rookie <PERSON>Rodney Hampton</PERSON> gained most of 
his 105 yards on similar ground plays. His problem in the clutch was that he 
ran into <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> too often. 
</P>
<P>
Once more, the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> seemed to be playing too conservatively to make a Super 
Bowl impression this <DATE>winter</DATE>. For example, on successive plays at midfield in 
the <DATE>second quarter</DATE>, they ran the ball on second and four and third and two, 
then punted. 
</P>
<P>
On their next series, after getting to the <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> 10-yard line on penalties, 
the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> played for their field goal with a power run, a draw play, and a 
third-down pass that <PERSON>Simms</PERSON> threw away. 
</P>
<P>
That used to be <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> football, too. No more. The Bills have jumped into 
Super Bowl contention by abandoning their conservative approach. On numerous 
running downs now, they throw the ball, they attack their opponents, they come 
with four receivers on first down, they leave the huddling to such as the 
<ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the Bills can stay in the championship race is now up to <PERSON>Reich</PERSON>, who was 
3-0 replacing <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> last year. He seems to have the native ability. On defense, 
<PERSON>Smith</PERSON> has it.

Thurman Thomas rushed for 148 yards in 27 carries and <PERSON>Larry Kinnebrew</PERSON> had 121 
in 21 tries and each scored a touchdown as the <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bills emphasized the run 
and the pass rush in a 31-17 victory over the <LOCATION>Miami Dolphins</LOCATION> <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills have won three in a row and five of their last six and lead the 
<ORGANIZATION>American Conference East</ORGANIZATION> with a 6-2 record. 
</P>
<P>
The game was played before 80,208 fans -- the largest crowd ever at Rich 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo twice sacked <PERSON>Dan Marino</PERSON>, who had gone 19 games without being sacked, 
and gained 280 against the Dolphins. Thomas and <PERSON>Kinnebrew</PERSON> accounted for all but 
11 of those yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills ran on 51 of their 60 plays. 
</P>
<P>
With <PERSON>Frank Reich</PERSON> at quarterback, <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> has won all three games since <PERSON>Jim 
Kelly</PERSON> separated a shoulder in a 37-14 loss to the <LOCATION>Indianapolis Colts</LOCATION> on <DATE>Oct. 8</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jeff Wright</PERSON> snapped <PERSON>Marino</PERSON>'s streak of 759 pass attempts without a sack in the 
<DATE>second quarter</DATE>, and <PERSON>Cornelius Bennett</PERSON> had another sack in the <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Marino</PERSON> also threw three interceptions, with <PERSON>Kirby Jackson</PERSON> returning his second 
of the game 40 yards for a touchdown with three minutes to play. <PERSON>Scott Secules</PERSON> 
then replaced <PERSON>Marino</PERSON>, who had 20 completions in 36 attempts for 255 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins (4-4) managed only 65 yards rushing in losing for the first time 
in four games. 
</P>
<P>
A 21-point second quarter by the Bills blew the game open and gave them a 21-3 
lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kinnebrew</PERSON> opened the explosion two seconds into the quarter with a one-yard 
touchdown run. All 15 plays on the 76-yard drive were rushes. 
</P>
<P>
A <PERSON>Bennett</PERSON> interception at the <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> 42-yard line set up the score that put 
<LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> ahead, 14-3. <PERSON>Bruce Smith</PERSON>, who stopped Dolphins running back <PERSON>Sammie 
Smith</PERSON> several times for losses in the first half, hurried <PERSON>Marino</PERSON> into throwing 
the interception. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas finished the four-play drive with a 30-yard scoring run. The play began 
as a sweep to the right and <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> dodged four would-be tacklers before cutting 
to the left and into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
The final touchdown of the quarter came on a 63-yard pass from <PERSON>Reich</PERSON> to rookie 
<PERSON>Don Beebe</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>'s two touchdowns came on two 44-yard passes, one from <PERSON>Marino</PERSON> to <PERSON>Mark 
Clayton</PERSON> and the other from <PERSON>Secules</PERSON> to <PERSON>Andre Brown</PERSON>.

   Chief <PERSON>Frank Fools Crow</PERSON>, a widely respected
Sioux Indian spiritual leader who traveled with the <ORGANIZATION>Buffalo Bill
Cody Wild West Show</ORGANIZATION> as a young man, died <DATE>Monday</DATE> at the home of his
grandchildren.
   Fools Crow was born just south of the <LOCATION>Porcupine</LOCATION> district of the
<ORGANIZATION>Pine Ridge Indian Reservation</ORGANIZATION>. His exact age was not known, but he
was believed to be 99.
   In an interview earlier this year, <ORGANIZATION>Fools Crow</ORGANIZATION> said he quit
school in the third grade to work to help his family earn a living.
As he grew to manhood, he said, he traveled throughout the nation
with the Cody wild west show.
   The chief said he followed ``vision quests'' that directed him
into a life of healing and tribal leadership. He saw alcoholism and
jealousy as the greatest curses for Indian people.
   In an interview with <ORGANIZATION>The Rapid City Journal</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>February</DATE>, <PERSON>Fools
Crow</PERSON> said he realized the world was changing, but modern problems
must be dealt with through cooperation and without losing sight of
the old ways.
   ``We need peace and understanding and unity of all young men,
young women and elders _ both Indian and non-Indian alike,'' <PERSON>Fools
Crow</PERSON> said. ``We must all stand together and work together for the
reason of peace and tranquility of life for all.''
   Fools <PERSON>Crow</PERSON>, a medicine man and spiritual grandfather, had lived
with grandchildren in a trailer home near <PERSON>Kyle</PERSON> after the death of
his second wife, <PERSON>Kate</PERSON>, in <DATE>October 1988</DATE>. His first wife, <ORGANIZATION>Fannie
Afraid of Hawk</ORGANIZATION>, died in <DATE>1954</DATE>. Services are pending with the
Osheim-Catron Funeral Home in <LOCATION>Rapid City</LOCATION>.
   Fools <PERSON>Crow</PERSON> said respect, generosity, courage, knowledge and
wisdom were keys to the survival of the Lakota culture.
   ``These values start from the home. They are taught there and
expressed there and carried into the world,'' he said. ``You must
first better understand yourself before you can express yourself to
others. The Lakota values help you do this.''
   <PERSON>Thomas E. Mails</PERSON>, an artist and ethnologist who has produced four
major studies on North American Indians, wrote the holy man's
biography, titled ``Fools Crow.''

<LEADPARA>  The Buffalo Bills won the only meeting with the New York Giants this season,
17-13 in East Rutherford, N.J., but a lot has changed since then.;    Buffalo

<TEXT>     Well, <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON>, who suffered a knee injury in that <DATE>Dec. 15</DATE> game, returned for
the playoffs and has led the Bills to 95 points in two games.;    And the
Giants now seem to believe in <PERSON>Jeff Hostetler</PERSON>, who replaced <PERSON>Phil Simms</PERSON> after
the starting quarterback suffered a season-ending arch injury against <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>.

<ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> were the ones who were stuffed. Specifically running back <PERSON>Ottis

<LEADPARA>  Jim Kelly looked at the reporter incredulously when asked to identify the

<MEMO>  Super Bowl XXV
Chart attached to the end of this article  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     It's easy to overlook <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> despite numbers that make him the most
prolific running back/receiver in the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> over the past two seasons.;   
<PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>, a third-year player from <LOCATION>Oklahoma State</LOCATION>, rushed for a game-high 135
yards in 15 carries, including a 31-yard score. He added five catches for 55
yards, epitomizing his versatility.;    His season with the <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bills had
been punctuated with a touch of spiteful rage at the many people within the
media and the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> he perceives have never afforded him the proper accolades.; 
  That chance was within his grasp <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at <LOCATION>Tampa Stadium</LOCATION>, when <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> moved
the Bills into scoring position for <PERSON>Scott Norwood</PERSON>'s 47-yard field-goal
attempt.;    His run of 21 yards to the Bills' 40-yard line, followed shortly
by a 10-yard gain before the field-goal attempt, probably would have
positioned <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> on a podium before a collection of microphones and cameras
capturing the emotions of the Super Bowl's most valuable player.;    But when
<ORGANIZATION>Norwood</ORGANIZATION>'s kick sailed wide right in the final seconds, so did <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>' chances
of national prominence. Thomas received only one MVP vote.;    "We didn't win
the ballgame, so you have to say that somebody on their team deserves to be
the most valuable player," <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said, congratulating Giants running back
<PERSON>Ottis Anderson</PERSON>. "If we would have won, maybe it would have been different.";  
 <ORGANIZATION>The Giants</ORGANIZATION> did everything possible to take <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> out of the Bills' no-huddle
offense, assigning a "spy" to shadow Thomas constantly. Those responsibilities
belonged to <PERSON>Lawrence Taylor</PERSON> and <PERSON>Leonard Marshall</PERSON>. "I figured that by late in
the game they would forget about me," <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said.;    Hardly.;    Despite
<PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>' complaints, the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> knew that one of their defensive priorities was
to stop Thomas.;    The Bills wavered on <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> only slightly before selecting
him during the <DATE>1988</DATE> draft. Their concerns centered on a two-year-old knee
injury and subsequent surgery.;    The Bills picked <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>, who rushed for 881
yards his rookie season, with the 39th selection in the draft. In subsequent
seasons, <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> has rushed for 1,244 yards and 1,297 yards, including 11
rushing touchdowns this season.;    "I wanted to go out and show a lot of
media guys I was underrated and I didn't get the credit that I thought I
deserved," <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said. "Nobody around the league, or in other cities, thinks
I'm a good football player.;    "Hopefully, in a few months, I will be rated
higher.";    And, <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> hopes, the opportunity of Super Bowl fame will come
once again.; <LOCATION>THOMAS VS. ANDERSON</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Ottis Anderson</PERSON> won the
most-valuable-player award,; but <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Thurman Thomas</PERSON> won the battle of
running backs.; Here's how they compared <DATE>Sunday</DATE>:; Player        No.  Yds  Avg

<LEADPARA>  As quickly as you could say "no-huddle offense," it was no contest.;    The
Buffalo Bills showed no weakness and left no doubt in their 51-3 victory
Sunday over the Los Angeles Raiders that the AFC is a genuine possibility to
win its first Super Bowl since 1984, when the Raiders beat the Washington
Redskins.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  BILLS' NO-HUDDLE OFFENSE WIPES OUT RAIDERS
51-3  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  AFC Championship: Bills 51, Raiders 3
Chart attached to the end of this article  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     By winning a trip to <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>, the Bills cut the number of teams yet to go to
the championship game to nine. Buffalo lost the <DATE>1989</DATE> AFC championship game to
the <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> Bengals 21-10. The Bills' only previous Super Bowl chance was
in <DATE>1967</DATE> when, as the two-time defending <ORGANIZATION>American Football League</ORGANIZATION> champions,
they lost 31-7 to the <LOCATION>Kansas City Chiefs</LOCATION> for a berth in the first Super Bowl.;
   The Raiders, who had the stingiest scoring defense in the league this
season, weren't up to stopping the Bills' relentless no-huddle offense that
scored an AFC championship game-record seven TDs, six in the first half.;   
It was <PERSON>Thurman Thomas</PERSON> up the middle, quarterback <PERSON>Jim Kelly</PERSON> to <LOCATION>Thomas</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> to
wide receiver <PERSON>Andre Reed</PERSON>, <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> up the middle and <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> to <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> again
before the flustered <ORGANIZATION>Raiders</ORGANIZATION> called a timeout and the Bills huddled for the
first time in the game.;    "I don't know how they did it," said <ORGANIZATION>Raiders</ORGANIZATION>
linebacker <PERSON>Jerry Robinson</PERSON>. "It was like clockwork -- everything they did --
just like clockwork.";    By then, in little more time than it takes to read
about it, the Bills were just 20 yards and five plays from a 7-0 lead and, in
effect, victory.;    Though the Raiders drove to a 41-yard field goal by <PERSON>Jeff
Jaeger</PERSON> on their first possession, the Bills scored again, in just four plays,
on their second possession to make it 14-3. After <PERSON>Darryl Talley</PERSON> intercepted a
pass by <PERSON>Jay Schroeder</PERSON> and returned it for a third touchdown, it was 21-3 with
3 minutes, 9 seconds to go in the first quarter.;    "The only thing that's a
problem with the no-huddle," <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said, "is that we score so quick there's a
lot of minutes left on the clock. We've decided that if we're going to score
quick, we might as well score touchdowns rather than field goals.";    The
no-huddle offense, considered a novelty when Bengals Coach <PERSON>Sam Wyche</PERSON>
introduced it in <DATE>1988</DATE>, may be the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>'s fad of the future. The Bills, the
<ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>'s top scoring team, have scored 95 points in their two playoff games this
season, mostly without huddling.;    "I won't say it's not stoppable," said
Bills center <PERSON>Kent Hull</PERSON>, "but if we don't stop ourselves, this is as good an
offense as there is in the league.";    Yet even <PERSON>Hull</PERSON> says it's <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON>, not the
lack of huddling, that makes the offense go.;    "He sees those substitutes
come in and immediately goes to where the advantage is to our side," <PERSON>Hull</PERSON>
said.;    On the Bills' first possession, <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> found itself in a
standard four-back defense and couldn't substitute a fifth back until the
timeout. By the Bills' third offensive series, the Raiders were up to six
defensive backs and <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> was going more to <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>, who rushed for 109
first-half yards and finished the day with 138 in 25 carries, leaving for good
in the third quarter.;    "Hey, if you're going to bring in all those <ORGANIZATION>DBs</ORGANIZATION>,
we're going to run the football," <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> said.;    The Bills also unveiled a
new wrinkle they had been tempted to try <DATE>last week</DATE> against the <LOCATION>Miami Dolphins</LOCATION>,
whom they beat 44-34.;    <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>, whose combined 1,829 yards rushing and
receiving during the regular season were the most of any <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> running back,
occasionally was moved outside as a fifth wide receiver, leaving <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> alone
in shotgun formation. It helped Thomas make five receptions for 61 yards.;   
But there was little the Bills weren't successful with on offense until the
<DATE>second half</DATE>, when they went back to the old-fashioned huddle and conservative
play calling, and still scored 10 points.; LA Raiders  3 00 0--3; <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>

   Actor <PERSON>Bruce Boxleitner</PERSON>, who co-starred
in the television series ``Scarecrow and <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON>,'' will receive
the <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bill Award at the <DATE>1988</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Nebraskaland Days</ORGANIZATION>, officials
said.
   Plans for the <DATE>June 18-26</DATE> celebration were outlined <DATE>Saturday</DATE>
<TIME>night</TIME> at the annual <ORGANIZATION>Buffalo Bill Birthday Dance</ORGANIZATION>, one of
<ORGANIZATION>Nebraskaland Days</ORGANIZATION>' biggest fund-raisers.
   Nebraskaland Days President <PERSON>Kim Baxter</PERSON> said <PERSON>Boxleitner</PERSON> has
western connections through television movies and his interest in
quarter horses.
   ``To be honest, they're not making as many westerns as they used
to,'' <PERSON>Baxter</PERSON> said. ``It lessens the field when you limit it to
people in westerns. We've gone to choosing a person who represents
good family entertainment. But it's good when you can get someone
who has been in westerns.''
   Boxleitner appeared as <PERSON>James Arness</PERSON>' nephew in ``The Macahans,''
which inspired the ``How the West Was Won'' series. He was <PERSON>Kenny
Rogers</PERSON>' co-star in three ``Gambler'' television movies.
   Boxleitner lives in the <LOCATION>San Fernando Valley</LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION>Los
Angeles</LOCATION>.
   The annual celebration features rodeo performances, a parade and
many other events with a western theme. Gov. <PERSON>Kay Orr</PERSON> has designated
Nebraskaland Days as one of the key events in her ``Celebrate
<LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> <DATE>'88</DATE>'' tourism promotion.

With the game secured, intended messages sent, <PERSON>Greg Bell</PERSON>'s clock rung, <PERSON>Frank 
Reich</PERSON> discovered, the unbeatens beaten and 1:33 remaining, a football game 
unraveled at the seams and unfolded into <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> history -- a conclusion 
seen but not believed by the Rams, who may need weeks to recover. 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bills defeated the Rams, 23-20, before 76,231 at Rich Stadium on an 
eight-yard scoring pass from <PERSON>Reich</PERSON> to receiver <PERSON>Andre Reed</PERSON> with 16 seconds 
remaining. But one play doesn't begin to tell the story of the Bills who, in a 
span of 1 minute 17 seconds, won a game, lost a game, and snatched a game back, 
using a near-impossible scenario that included a quarterback making his first 
<ORGANIZATION>National Football League</ORGANIZATION> start. 
</P>
<P>
It started innocently with Bill tailback <PERSON>Thurman Thomas</PERSON>, who was running out 
the clock on a 16-13 win, the Rams helpless after failing on fourth down at 
their own 22. Thomas headed into the line on first down, and was stripped of 
the ball by linebacker <PERSON>Mel Owens</PERSON>. <PERSON>Michael Stewart</PERSON> somehow recovered at the 22 
with 1:33 and one last breath of life to be breathed. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback <PERSON>Jim Everett</PERSON> heaved a pass over the middle on first down and <PERSON>Flipper 
Anderson</PERSON> somehow caught it and eluded defenders <PERSON>Kirby Jackson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Leonard Smith</PERSON> 
on the way to a 78-yard touchdown play with 1:22 left, deadening a sellout 
crowd and sending the Rams into gyrations of elation on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills were left with barely more than a minute and three timeouts with 64 
yards to cover behind <PERSON>Reich</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jim Kelly</PERSON>'s replacement and a man who once went 
three years without throwing a pass in this league. 
</P>
<P>
It was thought <PERSON>Reich</PERSON> had worked his one miracle for the evening, leading the 
Bills on a <DATE>fourth-quarter</DATE> drive that ended with a one-yard scoring pass -- the 
presumed game-winner -- to <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> with 2:23 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Reich is a boot salesman by trade, a quarterback by perseverance. 
</P>
<P>
When he took control behind center at his own 36 with 1:17 remaining, the 
<PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> catch firmly embedded, there seemed little chance. But the Rams were 
lying back, and <PERSON>Reich</PERSON> chopped them to pieces, the first deep cut coming on an 
18-yard pass to <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> to the Ram 43. With 26 seconds left, <PERSON>Reich</PERSON> dumped a pass 
to <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> for 15 yards to the Ram 22. 
</P>
<P>
Then came a swing pass to <PERSON>Ronnie Harmon</PERSON>, who moved passed safety <PERSON>Vince Newsome</PERSON> 
for 14 yards to the Ram eight. Twenty seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
What could <PERSON>Reich</PERSON> have up his sleeve? Who before <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> could have cared? 
</P>
<P>
Reich's final strike to <ORGANIZATION>Reed</ORGANIZATION> was perfect on a post pattern. Reed lined up left 
and cut to the middle in front of <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION>' cornerback <PERSON>LeRoy Irvin</PERSON>. Reed crossed 
the goal's plane with 16 seconds left, briefly stopping Ram hearts and making 
<PERSON>Reich</PERSON> a hero. 
</P>
<P>
It was a game in which the final two minute outshone the first 58. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Mickey Sutton</PERSON>, the ex-Ram cornerback who keeps following his former teammates 
around the league -- he's already faced the Rams this season as a <LOCATION>Green Bay 
Packer</LOCATION> -- set up the <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION>' first score when he fumbled a wind-blown punt at his 
own 16 with 7:08 left in the quarter. On third and eight at the 14, <PERSON>Everett</PERSON> 
dumped a pass over the middle to <ORGANIZATION>Buford McGee</ORGANIZATION> to get the <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION> to first and goal 
at the four. One play later, <PERSON>Everett</PERSON> found McGee again on a three-yard scoring 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Bills' defense, inspired by <PERSON>Bruce Smith</PERSON> and <PERSON>Cornelius Bennett</PERSON>, wouldn't 
let the Rams pull away. 
</P>
<P>
With with 6:13 left in the half, the Bills, with great pleasure, forced Bell to 
fumble for the first time in 112 carries this season. <PERSON>Jeff Wright</PERSON> recovered at 
the Ram 20, and although the drive stalled, <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> made it 7-3 on <PERSON>Scott 
Norwood</PERSON>'s 38-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills shut down the Ram offense again on the ensuing possession, and got 
the ball back with 2:16 left at the Ram 49. 
</P>
<P>
Reich hit <ORGANIZATION>Reed</ORGANIZATION> on passes of nine and five yards to help get <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> close 
enough for <ORGANIZATION>Norwood</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the Bills barely managed. Norwood's 47-yard field goal with 
56 seconds left grazed the crossbar on its way over, slicing the lead to 7-6 at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Bell, who made no secret this week his disdain for <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>, was generally 
crushed at every turn. He gained 44 yards in 21 attempts but vowed to move on. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the media tried to hype this game," <PERSON>Bell</PERSON> said. "I just tried to go out 
and play the best football that I was capable of playing. Tomorrow morning we 
will wake up and this game will be history. We are going home 5-1 instead of 
being 6-0." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams had so many chances to prevent a miracle finish it bares inspection. 
On the first play of the second half, <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>, who gained 105 yards in 24 
carries, fumbled at his 33. But the Rams were knocked out of field goal range 
when <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> sacked <PERSON>Everett</PERSON> for a five-yard loss to the 37. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the <DATE>third quarter</DATE>, with the Bills driving in Ram territory, <PERSON>Reich</PERSON>'s 
pass went through cornerback <PERSON>Jerry Gray</PERSON>'s hands and bounced into <ORGANIZATION>Reed</ORGANIZATION>'s for a 
nine-yard gain. Had Gray held on, he might have scored. Instead, the Bills 
drove on and cut the lead to 10-9 on a 40-yard field goal by <ORGANIZATION>Norwood</ORGANIZATION> with 14:09 
left. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams drove 60 yards on their next possession, but again had to settle for 
three -- on <ORGANIZATION>Lanford</ORGANIZATION>'s 36-yarder -- instead of seven. 
</P>
<P>
The Bill defense, reborn after a slow start and local criticism, returned to 
form against the <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION>, sacking Everett twice and causing several more poor 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Henry Ellard</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>'s leading receiver, made his first catch with 5:05 left 
in the <DATE>third quarter</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"No question, they played their best game of the season," Bill Coach <PERSON>Marv Levy</PERSON> 
said of his defense. "They gave up that touchdown at the end on a great play, 
but they rose time and time again." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ram linebacker <PERSON>Fred Strickland</PERSON> sprained his left ankle in the <DATE>second half</DATE> but 
X-rays were negative. . . . <PERSON>Jim Everett</PERSON> completed 15 of 36 passes for 219 yards 
with two touchdowns and one interception.

<LEADPARA>  BUFFALO, N.Y. It's a dateline. It's a football game. No, it's SuperBowl, and
that means I have to make a prediction.;    I hate making predictions. But I
like the Giants.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  TAKE GIANTS OUTRIGHT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     I like the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> to win Super Bowl XXV over the <LOCATION>Buffalo Bills</LOCATION>. Take the
points -- the Giants are getting seven -- but you won't need them, and neither
will the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>. They'll win outright.;    The perspective on this matchup has
been severely skewed by <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>'s 51-3 rout of the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Raiders</ORGANIZATION> last
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>. Oh, it was impressive. So was the Bills' 44-34 beating of <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> <DATE>a week
earlier</DATE>. In two playoff games, the Bills have 95 points and nearly 1,000 yards
in offense.;    But today, the Bills aren't playing in <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>. They aren't
playing a warm-weather team in a cold, windy stadium. They are playing against
a defense the likes of which they have not seen, except for once. On <DATE>Dec. 15</DATE>,
the Bills played the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> and beat them 17-13.;    "THAT was our worst
game," Giants safety <PERSON>Dave Duerson</PERSON> said last week. It was a statement, not an
excuse.;    "We stunk," said Coach Bill Parcells.;    <PERSON>Parcells</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>
stunk in two areas, specifically: short-yardage offense, and tackling. Indeed,
videotape shows 11 missed tackles by the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>, resulting in 153 additional
yards for the Bills.;    It would be dangerous to put too much emphasis on
that <DATE>Dec. 15</DATE> game. A lot has changed in six weeks. Buffalo quarterback <PERSON>Jim
Kelly</PERSON>, injured in that game, has returned. <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> quarterback <PERSON>Phil Simms</PERSON>,
also injured that day, has not. But <PERSON>Jeff Hostetler</PERSON> has shown heart and
ability, and whatever the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> lose by not having <PERSON>Simms</PERSON> -- if they lose
anything at all -- is offset by two more differences from the <DATE>Dec. 15</DATE>
meeting:;    First, this game will be played on grass, where the Bills are 2-5
the last two seasons.;    Second, this is the Super Bowl, where no Bills
player has ever been. Granted, the hype has been extraordinarily small. Cut in
half by the schedule and reduced further by events in the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION>, this
might be the least-hyped Super Bowl in the <DATE>last 20 years.</DATE>;    But when the
players step on the field today, they'll know where they are and they'll feel
the height of the stakes. The Giants have been here before -- 25 of them,
including Parcells.;    To many of the "experts" at the Super Bowl, <PERSON>Parcells</PERSON>
is the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>' only chance. I don't know. Ever since that night at <LOCATION>Candlestick
Park</LOCATION>, when <PERSON>Parcells</PERSON> went for broke on fourth-and-goal from the 9, I've
wondered about the genius tag he wears.;    But <PERSON>Marv Levy</PERSON> is in a panic, they
say. He's tight. As evidence, they cite his decision to change hotels in
<LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>. Heck, that wasn't panic; that was a great move. You don't come to the
Super Bowl to stay at a Holiday Inn.;    Levy has done a tremendous job. The
Bickering Bills are now the Super Bowl Bills. They've got the no-huddle
offense. They've got the league's most-balanced offense. They've got <PERSON>Thurman
Thomas</PERSON>, a great running back. They've got <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON>, a fine quarterback.;    But,
in football, good hitting beats good pitching.;    <ORGANIZATION>The Giants</ORGANIZATION>' defense is No.
1 in fewest points allowed, No. 2 in yards allowed, No. 4 against the run and
No. 6 against the pass. Only one back has rushed for more than 100 yards
against the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>, and it wasn't Thurman Thomas. (<LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> rookie <PERSON>Johnny
Johnson</PERSON> ran for 108; <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> had 60 yards -- in 21 carries -- in the <DATE>Dec. 15</DATE>
game.);    The Giants are tough, and they're smart. They've got a plan to
counteract the no-huddle offense. They've also got <PERSON>Lawrence Taylor</PERSON>. He can
still dominate a game, and you might see that today. He sees this as possibly
his last Super Bowl. He is a man possessed.;    And, of course, the Bills
can't score if they don't have the ball. Against the 49ers <DATE>last Sunday</DATE>, the
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> offense controlled the ball for almost 40 minutes. It was a 40-20
split the week before against <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, too.;    There's no reason to think the
<ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> can't do that against the Bills. They already have, in fact; the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>
controlled the ball for 37 minutes, 59 seconds of that <DATE>Dec. 15</DATE> game. The Bills
rank 15th against the run.;    If this game comes down to a field goal, who do
you like: <PERSON>Matt Bahr</PERSON> or <PERSON>Scott Norwood</PERSON>? If it's a punting contest, you've got to
like the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON>Sean Landeta.</PERSON>;    See, you can find a dozen reasons to like
the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>. But you need only one, really, and it's the one I woke up with
<DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>: These guys stopped <LOCATION>Joe Montana</LOCATION> twice. That's enough for me.  </TEXT>

   Letters to the Editor:
   Hey, Buffalo Bill,
   Why Do You Kill?
</HL>
<DATE>
01/30/91
</DATE>
<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A11
</SO>
<LP>
   Michael Pearce's Jan. 9 Leisure &amp; Arts article, "Where the
Buffaloes Roam," or, more appropriately, "Won't You Come
Home, Buffalo Bill?," is another approach to cleansing guilt
by rationalizing the final phase of hunting -- the killing
portion. And with every paper on justifying the need to kill,
there is a paper expressing the ridiculous thesis of such a
farce.
   I am not a "weed eater" or animal-rights fanatic. So what
grinds me about Mr. Pearce's article? It's the contention
that hunting farm-raised buffaloes by men dressed in
buckskins and using black-powder rifles somehow overcomes the
true nature of the hunt. Hunting and killing animals is an
issue of control, of playing God over a living thing, and
nothing more. Unless, of course, you are stranded in the
middle of the wilderness and it is a means of survival.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Roy English of the story went to get meat. Sure, right.
And low in cholesterol -- hey, that's important. Don't get me
wrong. When I hunted as a boy, I was taught not to shoot
anything I didn't plan to clean and cook. But I didn't hunt
with the idea that I was reliving history or putting food on
the table. It was for sport, and that is what hunting
buffaloes is. If hunting a herd of ranch-raised animals can
be considered much of a hunt. At least I assume that the ones
on the <LOCATION>Smoky River Buffalo Ranch</LOCATION> are wilder than the ones
that stroll out of <ORGANIZATION>Yellowstone National Park</ORGANIZATION>.
   The article should have been written for one of the
hunting magazines; then <PERSON>Mr. Pearce</PERSON> could have gotten the
romance for his article that it justly deserved. The article
may have been appreciated in this paper had it ended one
sentence before <PERSON>Darrell Wuertz</PERSON>'s "humane insurance shot." But
<PERSON>Mr. Pearce</PERSON> has a right to submit his work to anyone. And this
paper has the right to print what it wants. <PERSON>Wilbur Williams</PERSON>
is within his rights to have a hunting ranch. He can stock it
with buffaloes or Holstein cows. Say, there's an idea.
   How many of you hunters out there ever got to sit around
the campfire and talk about the Holstein cow you brought
down? As for <PERSON>Mr. English</PERSON>, he could take a pail and stool with
him, milk the cow, then shoot it.

<HEAD>Museum Visitor Points Out Error In Remington Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bronze cowboy sculpture ``The Rattlesnake''
by famed Western artist <PERSON>Frederic Remington</PERSON> stopped museum visitor
<PERSON>Cy Baumgartner</PERSON> in his tracks _ the cowboy's tiny spurs were on
upside down.
   ``There's no way a cowboy would wear his spurs pointing up like
that,'' said <PERSON>Baumgartner</PERSON>, a former rodeo cowboy who now drives a
beer truck and raises quarter horses. ``It would be totally out of
character.''
   <PERSON>Baumgartner</PERSON>, who was touring the Remington exhibit <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at the
<LOCATION>St. Louis Art Museum</LOCATION>, apparently was the first to notice the error.
   ``I saw it immediately,'' he said. ``I just think it's funny
that nobody noticed it before now.''
   After <PERSON>Baumgartner</PERSON> pointed out the problem, museum workers
checked other bronzes on display.
   They found that all the spurs on the four horsemen in a casting
of ``Coming Through The Rye'' were also upside down.
   <PERSON>Peter H. Hassrick</PERSON>, one of the curators of the exhibit, said he
has occasionally noticed similar problems with <LOCATION>Remington</LOCATION> works in
private collections. He said he hadn't noticed the problem in the
<LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> exhibit.
   But that doesn't necessarily mean that <PERSON>Remington</PERSON>, the famed
sculptor and painter of Western themes who lived from <DATE>1861</DATE> to <DATE>1909</DATE>,
made the error.
   The spurs on the bronzes and other small pieces were cast
separately from the main work and, as a result, it was sometimes
left to a foundry worker with little knowledge of a cowboy's gear
to attach the spurs to the boots.
   On other occasions, <PERSON>Hassrick</PERSON> said, the spurs may have been
damaged and replacement spurs attached turned the wrong way.
   ``It's just a silly little thing, but I'm sure <PERSON>Remington</PERSON> wold
have liked to have seen them the right way,'' <PERSON>Hassrick</PERSON> said.
   ``If they were on one of our bronzes, we'd turn them around,''
said <PERSON>Hassrick</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Buffalo Bill Historical Center</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Cody</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyo.</LOCATION>, and an authority on <LOCATION>Remington</LOCATION>.
   Neither of the works in question, however, is owned by the
museum. ``The Rattlesnake'' casting is from a private collection,
and the casting of ``Coming Through the Rye'' is on loan from
<ORGANIZATION>Princeton University</ORGANIZATION>.
   The exhibit is open in <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> through <DATE>May 22</DATE>.

His journey has been a long and circuitous one through seven cities and three 
football leagues. 
</P>
<P>
But 29-year-old <PERSON>John Fourcade</PERSON> -- formerly of the <LOCATION>Memphis Showboats</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> 
Argonauts and <LOCATION>Denver Dynamite</LOCATION> -- finally made it to the big time <DATE>Sunday</DATE> and 
responded with a big-time performance. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been around in every league known to man except the European leagues," 
said <PERSON>Fourcade</PERSON>, who led <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION> to a 22-19 victory over the <LOCATION>Buffalo Bills</LOCATION>. 
"I was just happy to be out there playing today." 
</P>
<P>
Fourcade, whose only other starts came as the <ORGANIZATION>Saints</ORGANIZATION>' replacement quarterback 
during the <DATE>1987</DATE> strike, threw two touchdown passes, and <PERSON>Dalton Hilliard</PERSON> rushed 
for 97 yards and caught a 54-yard touchdown pass. Fourcade started in place of 
<PERSON>Bobby Hebert</PERSON>, whom <ORGANIZATION>Fourcade</ORGANIZATION> replaced last week. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the victory, <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>'s 20-10 win over <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> ended the <ORGANIZATION>Saints</ORGANIZATION>' 
slim playoff hopes. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a good football team," <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION> linebacker <PERSON>Pat Swilling</PERSON> said. "We 
just won't be going to the playoffs to show it." 
</P>
<P>
The loss was <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>'s second in a row and third in four games. The Bills (8-6) 
are repeating their swoon of last season, when they lost three of their final 
four regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a horror show," said Bills nose tackle <PERSON>Fred Smerlas</PERSON>. "We've got to 
go out and redeem ourselves if we're going to make the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
The Saints (7-7), who gained 436 total yards, took advantage of <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> 
turnovers on each of their first two possessions to build a 13-0 lead in the 
<DATE>first quarter</DATE>, and take a 16-12 lead after a snowy first half. 
</P>
<P>
The snow disappeared in the <DATE>second half</DATE>, but the <ORGANIZATION>Saints</ORGANIZATION>' defense continued to 
handle the Bills, getting a timely interception midway in the <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE> 
that <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION> eventually turned into the winning field goal. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Toi Cook</PERSON>, beat in the <DATE>second quarter</DATE> for a 42-yard touchdown pass caught by 
<PERSON>James Lofton</PERSON>, picked off a tipped ball near the Saints' end zone as <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> was 
driving for a go-ahead score. 
</P>
<P>
"The way (Bills' kicker <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>) <PERSON>Norwood</PERSON> was kicking, that would've been a chip 
shot for him," <PERSON>Cook</PERSON> said. "Somebody (Thurman Thomas) tipped the ball and it 
just ended up in my hands." 
</P>
<P>
With <PERSON>Fourcade</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hilliard</PERSON> leading the way, the Saints drove 81 yards to the 
<LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> four, setting up a 22-yard field goal by <PERSON>Morten Andersen</PERSON>. <PERSON>Brett Maxie</PERSON> 
clinched the victory with <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>' third interception of <PERSON>Jim Kelly</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very proud of them after what has happened the last couple of weeks," said 
<LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>Jim Mora</PERSON>, whose team lost their previous two games by a total 
of 10 points. "You have to play pretty good to beat these guys."

<DESCRIPT>  PROFESSIONAL; FOOTBALL; CHAMPIONSHIP; REVIEW; GAME; LIST; CHART  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  The Buffalo Bills reached the silver anniversary Super Bowl with a 15-3
record, with the NFL's top-rated passer, with its total-yardage leader and
without a huddle.;    In this case, what the Bills don't have is almost as
important as what they do, because it was the adoption of the wide-open
no-huddle offense that brought them to within one victory of a championship
for which they've never played.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  THE BILLS' NO-HUDDLE CAN MUDDLE A DEFENSE
WASTING NO TIME, BUFFALO'S OFFENSE HAS BEEN
WORKING LIKE CLOCKWORK  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Super Bowl XXV: A Viewer's Guide
Chart attached to the end of this article  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Buffalo had quarterback <PERSON>Jim Kelly</PERSON> for four previous seasons, ever since the
folding of the <ORGANIZATION>USFL</ORGANIZATION> in which he played, but the offense he directed was so
lifeless that not only <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> but Bills owner <PERSON>Ralph Wilson</PERSON> publicly
complained.;    Offensive coordinator <PERSON>Ted Marchibroda</PERSON> switched to the
no-huddle, which put the play-calling responsibility on <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> as well as
prevented substitutions and adjustments by the defense. He was persuaded to
change for a reason that long has intrigued many football fans: With the
ability of no-huddle offenses to rapidly move the ball in the final minutes of
each half, why not use such an offense the entire game?;    "Last year there
were three times when we had to score the last two times we had the ball to
win -- the <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Marchibroda</PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION>Buffalo News</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>this
week</DATE>. "So I said to myself, 'If it's so successful at the end of the half and
the end of ballgames, why would it not be successful during the regular course
of the game?' So we opened up with it against <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION>, and it has been
going ever since.";    Using the new offense against the Colts in the season
opener, <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> began the game with a team-record 14 consecutive completions in
a 26-10 victory.;    A week later, on an 88-degree day in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, the Bills
were clobbered 30-7. Two fumbles, an interception and three sacks proved the
no-huddle wasn't invincible. The Bills later called the game their "wake-up
call.";    But it was <DATE>two weeks later</DATE>, after a 30-7 <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> victory over
the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Jets in which all-purpose back <PERSON>Thurman Thomas</PERSON> rushed for 214
yards, that the rest of the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> woke up to what the Bills were up to.;    More
than the no-huddle offense was working for the Bills.;    Within 1 minute, 17
seconds of a <DATE>Sept. 30</DATE> game against the <ORGANIZATION>Denver Broncos</ORGANIZATION>, the Bills threw up 20
<DATE>fourth-quarter</DATE> points, erased a 21-9 Broncos lead and won <DATE>29-28</DATE>. The next
week, in Game 5, with the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Raiders</ORGANIZATION> leading 24-14 in the final
period, <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> scored 24 points in 6:03 to win 38-24.;    The victory over
the <ORGANIZATION>Raiders</ORGANIZATION> began with a 42-yard touchdown pass from <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> to wide receiver
<PERSON>James Lofton</PERSON>. Then a blocked punt by <PERSON>Steve Tasker</PERSON> was picked up by <PERSON>James
Williams</PERSON> and returned for a touchdown. Linebacker <PERSON>Cornelius Bennett</PERSON> sacked the
<ORGANIZATION>Raiders</ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON>Jay Schroeder</PERSON> on the next possession, causing a fumble that <PERSON>Bennett</PERSON>
recovered. The Bills got a field goal from that turnover. Three plays later,
cornerback <PERSON>Nate Odomes</PERSON> stripped the ball from receiver <PERSON>Willie Gault</PERSON> and ran 49
yards for another TD.;    It took a scoring pass from <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> to fullback <PERSON>Jamie
Mueller</PERSON> with 19 seconds to go to beat the Jets 30-27 the next week before the
scary games were over for a while.;    The Bills knocked off the <ORGANIZATION>New England
Patriots</ORGANIZATION> 27-10 in Game 7, swamped the <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> Browns 42-0 in Game 8, pounded
the <ORGANIZATION>Phoenix Cardinals</ORGANIZATION> 45-10 in rain, hail and snow to start the <DATE>second half of
the season</DATE>, and then shut out the Patriots 14-0.;    In <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, the string
snapped. The Oilers, behind the passing of <PERSON>Warren Moon</PERSON>, won 27-24.;    The
next week against the playoff-bound <LOCATION>Philadelphia Eagles</LOCATION>, however, <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> fired
three touchdown passes in a 24-0 <DATE>first quarter</DATE> and the Bills held on for a
30-23 victory.;    An easy 31-7 victory over the Colts brought the Bills to a
Super Bowl preview, a 17-13 defeat of the <ORGANIZATION>New York Giants</ORGANIZATION> in which <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> and
<ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> quarterback <PERSON>Phil Simms</PERSON> sustained injuries.;    Playing without <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON>,
who had suffered torn cartilage and damaged ligaments in his knee, the Bills
avenged their early season defeat by downing the Dolphins 24-14 to clinch the
<ORGANIZATION>AFC East</ORGANIZATION> title. Fill-in quarterback <PERSON>Frank Reich</PERSON> was 15 of 21 for 234 yards and
TDs to <PERSON>Lofton</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Andre Reed.</ORGANIZATION>;    With the home-field advantage assured
throughout the <ORGANIZATION>AFC</ORGANIZATION> playoffs, the Bills were downed 29-14 by the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>
Redskins in the regular-season finale.;    After a week off while the
wild-card teams and the weakest division winner fought it out, <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> returned
to the lineup to lead the Bills to a 44-34 victory over the Dolphins in a
snowstorm. That set up <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s 51-3 blowout of the <ORGANIZATION>Raiders</ORGANIZATION> and a berth in the
Super Bowl.;    "There used to be a joke around here when we were not
winning," linebacker <PERSON>Darryl Talley</PERSON> said after the <ORGANIZATION>AFC</ORGANIZATION> championship game. "It

<DESCRIPT>  RESTAURANT; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  One of the best birthday presents I've received lately is a book on bad taste.
I refused to take the gift personally, but I felt it was a reflection of my
fascination with American pop culture. Pop culture is really serious business,
something akin to a fun house mirror, as it usually tells us more about
ourselves and how we live than we commonly think about and perhaps more than
we would like to know.;    If I were to mention almost any of the items or
categories in the Encyclopedia of Bad Taste, I'd be inundated with letters
castigating my morals, intelligence and parentage.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  BUFFALO BILL STILL SERVES GOOD PUB FOOD
HAYWARD EATERY FEATURES WELL-MADE BEER  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Dining Out
The Weekly's reviewers evaluate restaurants as typical consumers. They visit
area restaurants as unannounced, paying customers.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Needless to say, I was a little surprised to find beer included, though the
authors provide a fair rationale for their choice. On the other hand, however,
a growing little industry is the brew pub and its accompanying cuisine.;   
<LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bill's brew pub in <LOCATION>Hayward</LOCATION>, owned and operated by an award-winning
former photo-journalist <PERSON>Bill Owens</PERSON>, was at the vanguard of the brew pub
movement and while some places have come and gone, <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>'s, which opened in
<DATE>1982</DATE>, has been around for a while.;    This is not high cuisine. Instead, what
you get is an Americanized version of pub food: fairly simple food, usually a
little spicy, chosen and served to accompany and complement the custom-brewed
beer.;    What is nice, even good, about brew pubs, and there is a fair-sized
number of such places ringing the bay, is that each is different in the beer
they brew and serve, in their food and in their atmosphere. This is true
individuality in a culture marked by mass marketing and mass consumption.;   
The food served at <LOCATION>Buffalo Bill</LOCATION>'s is, after all, pretty good. It is usually
quickly prepared and served and is priced at the lower end of the restaurant
dollar spectrum.;    At the high end of the menu are <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bill's personal
pizzas for <MONEY>$5.</MONEY>;    Given what I have paid for a personal pizza, this is a good
buy.;    The offerings actually vary, so it's worth asking what's on the
menu.;    Not long ago I had an American southwestern style pizza, flavored
with a smoky, salsa-like sauce in lieu of the traditional tomato paste. There
were chilies, red peppers, onions, dried tomatoes and a chorizo-style sausage.
Not only was it very good, but given what a <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>
gourmet-ghetto personal pizza goes for, it was a steal.;    More recently,
<LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>'s has been offering a more traditional personal pizza, but the quality
of ingredients, peppers, salami, onions, is more than adequate and the sauce
at least on the good side of average.;    The thin pizza crust is handmade and
as good as you'd find.;    One warning however: because this is a small
restaurant, they do sell out. On a recent <DATE>Monday</DATE> lunch, the pizzas weren't
available because they had used all the available dough on the weekend and the
new batch hadn't finished rising.;    In the mid-range of prices, at <MONEY>$3</MONEY>, is a
small selection of sandwiches, turkey, ham, pastrami and the like, as well as
two good sausages, a hot link and a polish sausage.;    Both the hot link and
polish are done very well. Served on a crisp french roll, the sausages are
meaty, lean, flavorful and tender.;    To make a good thing even better, the
links are served with melted jack or Swiss cheese and dressed with a dark,
spicy tomato sauce which complements the taste of the meat.;    Accompanying
the roll will be a generous handful of tortilla chips, pickle chips and a hot
pepper or two. For <MONEY>$3</MONEY>, not bad.;    A couple other pub classics, buffalo wings
and a ploughman's lunch are also available for <MONEY>$3</MONEY>. Both are a good, cheap
lunch.;    <PERSON>Bill</PERSON>'s soups (<MONEY>$3.50</MONEY> a bowl, <MONEY>$2</MONEY> a cup), are also better than
expected. Again, the offering will change daily, but I've sampled three:
chili, corn chowder and black bean soup, and all were done very competently.
The soups, and all the food, are made in a tiny kitchen so it is sometimes
amazing how good the items are. The black bean soup was superb and it is worth
a call to find out when it's being offered.;    I can do without the swirl of
sour cream that cooks seem to think is necessary, but the soup was rich and
filled with a complex range of spices and taste. It is good.;    <PERSON>Bill</PERSON>'s chili
is also done very well and when I heard the person behind the bar boast about
her "killer chili," I had to try it.;    While a bowl of chili and a glass of
beer may be really plebeian, when you taste both (or either) at <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>'s,
then you may want to consider your preconceptions.;    The chili, like the
black bean soup, was hearty and rich, filled with tender beans, a deep broth
and tender pieces of meat. Even on a sunny winter's day, you can't go wrong.; 
  My last lunch at <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>'s coincided with an offering of Bill's Double Cream
Ale (<MONEY>$1.75</MONEY> for a small glass, <MONEY>$3.25</MONEY> for a pint), one of the smoothest,
creamiest ales I've tasted.;    There is a hint of cream soda in the glass,
but this is true, pure beer, born of a skilled brewer's hand. If you associate
beer with the canned or bottled stuff brewed in huge tanks and consumed in
mass quantities in front of a televised football game, then prepare to have
your reality altered.;    In fact, almost all of <PERSON>Bill Owen</PERSON>'s beers are very
good and brewed for sipping and tasting, not for some macho entertainment. In
the <DATE>fall</DATE>, a trip to <LOCATION>Hayward</LOCATION> to taste his Pumpkin Ale is worth making.;    The
decor/atmosphere is on the downside. The place is dark with concrete walls
lightened by a collection of flags, a history of brewing and beer display, a
battered football game, cases of beer, a dart board and, of course, a
wall-mounted buffalo head. There is a long wooden bar and a collection
miscellaneous library tables and assorted chairs. It is, for good or bad, the
type of place where you don't need to take off your baseball hat when you
dine.;    Buffalo Bill's; (star)(star) 1/2; Where: <DATE>1082</DATE> B Street, <LOCATION>Hayward</LOCATION>;

for 'Dove' sequel.  </CAPTION>
<DESCRIPT>  CELEBRITY  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  CHANCES seem solid that Tommy Lee Jones, Anjelica Huston and other principal
members of the 1989 "Lonesome Dove" cast will take part in its planned
sequel.;    According to exec producer Suzanne de Passe, all "surviving cast
members" are ready to saddle up for another chapter in the western saga,
"subject to reading the script, of course."  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Living  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  'LONESOME DOVE' SEQUEL A LIKELIHOOD  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  The Grapevine  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     That script is now being drafted by <PERSON>John Wilder</PERSON>, with "Lonesome Dove"
novelist <PERSON>Larry McMurtry</PERSON> serving as consultant. If all goes as planned,
"Lonesome Dove II" should be galloping onto the video range in the fall of
'92.;    MEANWHILE: De Passe hopes to follow the "Lonesome" sequel with a
four-hour miniseries adaptation of <PERSON>McMurtry</PERSON>'s "Buffalo Girls" for <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>. "We've
made the deal . . . Hopefully we could make it for <DATE>spring of '93</DATE>." De Passe
has no casting in mind for the featured role of <ORGANIZATION>Calamity Jane</ORGANIZATION>, but says the
part is an actress' dream. She explains that <PERSON>McMurtry</PERSON>'s "Buffalo Girls" paints
a very different portrait of the renowned gun-totin' cowgirl who buddied with
such famed real-life characters of the Old West as Wild <PERSON>Bill Hickock</PERSON> and
<ORGANIZATION>Buffalo Bill Cody</ORGANIZATION>. Says the producer, "She's really a rugged character in this
piece -- with her male side extremely in the forefront . . . she lived hard,
rode hard and abused herself. She had a heart of gold, but was very
self-destructive and could never quite pull it all together. It's a very
poignant story."; From <PERSON>Liz Smith</PERSON> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>;    MORE VOTES: <DATE>Last week</DATE>, it was
said that a <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> voters' poll indicates <PERSON>Sen. Edward Kennedy</PERSON> should
step aside in the light of recent events in <LOCATION>Palm Beach.</LOCATION>;    Interestingly
enough, columnist <PERSON>Jimmy Breslin</PERSON> was the first to point the way for the
senator, suggesting it was time for him to try Alcoholics Anonymous. Now comes
the controversial and powerful <PERSON>Bob Scheer</PERSON> in the <DATE>August</DATE> issue of Playboy, and
he urges <LOCATION>Kennedy</LOCATION> to do the same thing.;    <PERSON>Scheer</PERSON> makes his plea in an
evocation of <LOCATION>Kennedy</LOCATION>'s longtime effectiveness as a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> senator and says <PERSON>Ted</PERSON>'s
efforts as a public servant have far outstripped both his brothers', <PERSON>John</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Robert</PERSON>. Scheer notes that <LOCATION>Kennedy</LOCATION> is the best advocate for <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s
underprivileged, and he too urges the senator to embrace "the 12 steps.";   
NOVEL RESPONSE: <PERSON>Julia Phillips</PERSON> called this week. Although banned from all of
<LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION>'s smart movie-denizen cafes since she published her memoir, "You'll Never
Eat Lunch in This Town Again," she sounded well-fed and carefree.;   
Recently, this column reported that <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> is working on her second book,
and it was implied that such a work might be based on portions cut by her
publisher's attorneys from <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON>' infamous real-life tale of her
drugged-out life and times. She says she may have "facetiously" said so, but
it is incorrect.;    "I have been struggling to write a complete book of
fiction for the past 10 years. Now I am actually going to do it, but not from
'discards' out of 'Lunch.' This novel will have as a character a dog who talks
and has a drug problem."  </TEXT>

<P>
Whenever <PERSON>Larry McMurtry</PERSON> sits down at the campfire of modern fiction, a wild 
cast of characters soon amble in from the shadows, and their compelling yarns 
quickly edge any weighty issues into the background. So it is in this tale of 
<PERSON>Martha Jane Canary</PERSON>, better known as <ORGANIZATION>Calamity Jane</ORGANIZATION>, as she and her companeros 
ramble across their old stompin' grounds, from the great plains of the <LOCATION>Dakotas</LOCATION> 
to the mountains of <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>, aimlessly seeking some vague goal that 
they all sense can no longer be found. 
</P>
<P>
The Indian wars are over, the buffalo gone, and the romance of the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> withers 
even as the legends it spawned blossom. The challenges of the old West took a 
physical toll, but this transitional era leaves folks without purpose. While 
the only violence in this novel happens "off stage," there is plenty of pain to 
go around. Now it is the characters' souls that get a sound whomping. 
</P>
<P>
In her younger days, <PERSON>Jane</PERSON> loved to "drink and sing and hoorah" with the 
cowboys. As "Buffalo Girls" unfolds, though, her carousing has become a form of 
self-administered anesthesia, rather than a celebration of the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>'s huge 
freedom. None of this is lost on the friends who wander in and out of <PERSON>Jane</PERSON>'s 
life, including mountain men <LOCATION>Bartle Bones</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Jim Ragg</PERSON>, an old <ORGANIZATION>Ogalala Sioux</ORGANIZATION> 
named No Ears and <PERSON>Jane</PERSON>'s best friend <PERSON>Dora DuFran</PERSON>, who runs a <ORGANIZATION>Miles City</ORGANIZATION> saloon 
and whorehouse named Hotel Hope. 
</P>
<P>
The central irony of the story is that the only hope of salvation for these 
characters arrives in an offer from their old friend Buffalo Bill, who 
convinces them that they might recapture their past glories -- real or imagined 
-- by joining his Wild West Show for a performance before <ORGANIZATION>Queen Victoria</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. In their hearts, <PERSON>Jane</PERSON> and her friends see the paradox. As <ORGANIZATION>Bartle</ORGANIZATION> says: 
"If <PERSON>Billy Cody</PERSON> can make a poster of it, then there ain't no Wild West." But 
<PERSON>Jane</PERSON> understands how desperately people can cling to foolish hopes. Eventually, 
she and her friends join <PERSON>Cody</PERSON>, <PERSON>Annie Oakley</PERSON>, Sitting Bull and other characters 
from the history books and <PERSON>McMurtry</PERSON>'s imagination to condense the shoot-'em-up 
history and myth of the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> into a sort of live-action miniseries, there in 
the heart of the civilization their forebears abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
It is fruitless to try and figure out how closely <PERSON>McMurtry</PERSON> sticks to facts 
here, because so many of the figures in this novel, as in "Anything for Billy" 
before it, were mired in legend long before <PERSON>McMurtry</PERSON> plucked them from their 
graves. 
</P>
<P>
But the mythologizing of history is only part of what "Buffalo Girls" is about. 
Both the characters and their country are struggling with middle age and the 
possibility that "the fun is over," and this discussion of loss and maturity 
also drives the book. 
</P>
<P>
Because "the fun" often was so excessive, for instance, the characters are left 
to face regrets. The West, <ORGANIZATION>Bartle</ORGANIZATION> concedes wistfully, has been "used up." 
</P>
<P>
" 'I blame it on the Indians,' he says. 'They gave up too soon.' " But he knows 
where the real blame lies: "What a monstrous mistake it had been to popularize 
buffalo hunting. Millions of them had roamed the plains -- it still seemed 
hardly credible to men who had seen the great herds in their glory that so many 
animals could be killed in only three years. But it had occurred: It weakened 
the Indians, armies had marched, brave men had died, and now they were to down 
to expositions." 
</P>
<P>
In one of the more poignant scenes in a book full of them, <PERSON>Jim Ragg</PERSON>, who has 
been inconsolable since he faced the realization that the beaver had gone the 
way of the buffalo, finds an exhibit of live American beaver at the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> zoo. 
</P>
<P>
For days, he sits and watches the animals he spent his life trapping, his faith 
in the world renewed. 
</P>
<P>
In another wonderful scene, No Ears, perhaps the most engaging character in the 
book, seems to foresee the continued destruction of the world's resources. As 
he sits on the boat that is taking the show to <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, enthralled by the 
ocean, the vast "herds" of fish flashing beneath the waves remind him of the 
buffalo charging in seemingly endless profusion over the plains. 
</P>
<P>
McMurtry tells his story in part through letters supposedly written by <PERSON>Jane</PERSON> to 
her daughter <PERSON>Janey</PERSON>, whom she has sent away to live with a well-to-do city 
couple. Recently, several male writers -- <PERSON>Jay McInerney</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Reynolds Price</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Jim 
Harrison</PERSON> among them -- have attempted to write from a woman's viewpoint, with 
mixed results. Some feminist critics even have chastised them for their 
arrogance. The real <PERSON>Jane</PERSON> did write letters to a supposed daughter, but with 
<PERSON>McMurtry</PERSON>'s grip on <ORGANIZATION>Calamity</ORGANIZATION>'s pen, these letters take some unusual twists, and 
the gender issue in "Buffalo Girls" is complicated by the fact that <PERSON>Jane</PERSON> is an 
unusually well-balanced mix of masculine and feminine traits. Even the delicate 
issue of <PERSON>Jane</PERSON>'s suspect womanhood, however, becomes almost insignificant in the 
sprawling context of the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> -- where, as <ORGANIZATION>McMurtry</ORGANIZATION> portrays things, tolerance 
is as important a survival technique as knowing how to crawl into the 
still-warm belly of a slaughtered buffalo in a blizzard. 
</P>
<P>
Wisely, <ORGANIZATION>McMurtry</ORGANIZATION> keeps the epistolary tactic reined in. Jane's voice is merely 
an intriguing subtext to his own much richer narrative voice. It is <PERSON>McMurtry</PERSON>'s 
description and dialogue and character, after all, that make readers plunge 
into the author's books the way some people fall into soap operas, wanting to 
spend as much time with his imagined people as possible, even though the 
characters are often thoroughly disagreeable. 
</P>
<P>
In this sense, "Buffalo Girls" is "Lonesome Dove" writ small. The book rolls 
along on anexistential current of melancholy, in contrast to which the moments 
of joy and hilarity are especially vivid. The good old days are gone, and most 
of these people will have no part in what follows. 
</P>
<P>
Returning to the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, No Ears finds his people demoralized, 
lacking even the survival instinct to listen to the old man's spiritual wisdom. 
Jane and her companeros have grown lazy and confused, unwilling to embrace the 
myths they are becoming, yet living in their own self-embellished pasts. As 
<PERSON>Jane</PERSON> writes: "Now all I do is piddle around in my memories. You've seen 
children make mud pies? That's what I do with my memories, I pat them into the 
shape I want them to take."

Still, there is something about these people and their passion for life that 
makes you want to be with them. You want to sit in the dirt and share that old 
prairie dog that <PERSON>Jim Ragg</PERSON> has just cooked over a barely flickering fire, even 
though he suspects it may be diseased. Why? Because set against the 
overwhelming vastness of the West, and of life, tolerable companionship looks 
awfully good. Despite the mundane sadness and glorious tragedy that stalks 
them, <PERSON>McMurtry</PERSON>'s characters seem to understand that life is, as one cowboy put 
it, "a sturdy business."

<P>
How the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> was won (or lost) doesn't make all that much difference here. 
History happened, and that's that. What matters is that the world was kept from 
flying apart by something as simple as friendship.
