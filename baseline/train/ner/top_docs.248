<HEAD>Pythons Found Moving Into Neighborhood</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OLDSMAR, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The seventh large python snake found
slithering around the same neighborhood has officials puzzled, but
not panicked.
   Experts are not sure where the snakes have come from, but say
rodents are in far more danger than residents.
   The latest python to be spotted in the 20-block area was captured
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. All seven snakes have been either full-grown Burmese
pythons or reticulated pythons from <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION>, averaging 12 to
15 feet in length and weighing up to 175 pounds, said <PERSON>Debbie Parker</PERSON>
of <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Rescue</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Rehab Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>St. Petersburg</LOCATION> facility that
cares for injured or abandoned wild animals.
   But because they are not aggressive and appear well-fed, <PERSON>Parker</PERSON>
believes they may have been turned loose by their owner.
   ``We're talking about big, big snakes, as big around as my leg,''
<PERSON>Parker</PERSON> said. ``If I lived in the area, I'd be worried. They're big
enough to eat a small child.''
   Pythons are constrictor snakes and suffocate prey, normally small
mammals such as raccoons and opossums.
   Burmese pythons are unlikely to attack people and should flee
when confronted by humans, said <PERSON>Patrick Parisi</PERSON>, president of the
<ORGANIZATION>West Coast Herpetological Society</ORGANIZATION>. He said such a snake would have
to be starving before it would attack a child for food.
   But pythons have small, sharp teeth that can inflict a painful
bite, he said. They also have a natural fear of falling that could
cause them to coil around anyone who attempts to pick them up.
   Reticulated pythons are the world's largest snakes, reaching
lengths of up to 36 feet. Burmese pythons can grow to 24 feet,
<PERSON>Parisi</PERSON> said. Both snakes can live up to 50 years in captivity.
   <PERSON>Parisi</PERSON> said it's possible the pythons may be offspring of snakes
that either escaped or were turned loose by the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION>Tarpon
Springs Zoo</ORGANIZATION>, which closed more than two decades ago. Development may
be forcing the snakes out of woodlands, he speculated.
   All of the snakes have been taken to the <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Rescue</ORGANIZATION>
facility. If they are not claimed within 10 days, they can be
donated to schools, zoos or other educational facilities, said
<PERSON>Vernon Yates</PERSON>, director of the center. Five of the snakes already
have been donated to other institutions, he said.
   ``I don't think there's too many people in this world we have to
tell to stay away from them,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Sheriff's Office</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>John
Bocchichio</PERSON>.

<HEAD>Zoos, Reptile Breeders Bidding For 20-foot Python</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zoos, exhibits and reptile breeders all over the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> are bidding for a 20-foot python found
under a home after reportedly having slithered around the
neighborhood for years.
   The animal catcher who helped bag the 250-pound snake said <DATE>Friday</DATE>
his prize catch won't necessarily go to the highest bidder.
   ``We want to put it where it will receive the best treatment,''
said <PERSON>Todd Hardwick</PERSON>, owner of Pesky Critters Relocation in suburban
<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, who noted the snake will probably go for about <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY>.
   Hardwick wouldn't name the bidders, but he said they include four
or five of the biggest zoos in the country. The snake now resides in
a special box built to contain its bone-crushing strength.
   On <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, <PERSON>Hardwick</PERSON> and three other men wrestled the snake from
underneath a <LOCATION>Fort Lauderdale</LOCATION> home. Residents say they've seen the
snake gobble down raccoons ``like marshmallows'' in a nearby park.
   <PERSON>Hardwick</PERSON> believes the snake is the largest ever captured in <LOCATION>South
Florida</LOCATION>, where many exotic pets are illegally released into the wild.
   The reticulate python, a native of southeastern <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>, can grow to more than 30 feet. Though not venomous, the
snake coils around its prey to stop the breathing and blood flow of
its victims.

BOAS, PYTHONS ON THE CRAWL IN FLORIDA;

SNAKES DUMPED IN FLORIDA GROW INTO BIG PROBLEMS

In just two years, an exotic snake abandoned in the wild can grow from a cute 
pet into a raccoon-eating monster, and large snakes are becoming a large animal 
control problem in southern <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Big pythons and boa constrictors have been popping up with unwelcome 
regularity, but the capture of 15-, 12- and 10-foot snakes within eight days in 
<DATE>June</DATE> in <LOCATION>Palm Beach County</LOCATION> were evidence the problem is getting bigger. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think it's nifty to have these snakes as pets," said <PERSON>Ron 
Magill</PERSON>, assistant curator of <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>'s MetroZoo. "Within a few years, that snake 
can exceed 10 feet. . . . They're also escape artists." 
</P>
<P>
But the escapees are only part of the problem in a region that offers an ideal 
climate for the cold-blooded, cold-wary animals. 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife experts believe dozens of snakes have been abandoned in the wild by 
pet owners after the novelty wears off, the feeding gets too expensive, medical 
bills get too high or the snakes become a threat to their owners. 
</P>
<P>
"They release it, evidently unaware or not caring about the impact on the 
natural environment or the human population in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>," said Lt. <PERSON>Jim 
Hoffstodt</PERSON>, spokesman for the state Game and <ORGANIZATION>Fresh Water Fish Commission</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>West 
Palm Beach</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Last <DATE>summer</DATE>, <PERSON>Todd Hardwick</PERSON>, a private trapper of nuisance animals, captured 
20-foot, 250-pound <ORGANIZATION>Big Mama</ORGANIZATION>, a reticulated python that landed him and her on 
"The Tonight Show." A crawl space under a Ft. Lauderdale house was the snake's 
home -- apparently for years. 
</P>
<P>
"I get reports all the time of big snakes down on Old Cutler Road," a suburban 
<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> thoroughfare that borders mangrove swamps, <PERSON>Hardwick</PERSON> said. "Airboaters and 
hunters see big ones in the <LOCATION>Everglades</LOCATION>, so there's a lot more out there." 
</P>
<P>
State officials acknowledge that they don't have a good grasp on the numbers. 
But <PERSON>Magill</PERSON> warned: "Keep in mind, I think for every snake that's found, there's 
10 of them that are never seen." 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>1987</DATE> and <DATE>1988</DATE>, the Port of <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> handled imports of 1.26 million reptiles, 
including snakes, turtles and lizards. A total of 18,150 ball pythons, a 
constrictor known to curl up in a ball, cleared customs. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't realize the sheer amounts of animals moving through this country, 
the amounts being imported into the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> for the pet trade," said Lt. 
<PERSON>Tom Quinn</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Custom Service</ORGANIZATION>'s inspections division in <LOCATION>Tallahassee</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
And <PERSON>Hardwick</PERSON> said he has found baby constrictors at two locations in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>'s 
<LOCATION>Dade County</LOCATION>, indicating that the big snakes may be mating in the wild. Boas can 
give birth to 60 offspring at a time. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest may be ahead. A python "as big as Big Mama or bigger yet" is 
being spotted every few months in a rugged, inaccessible area of <LOCATION>Dade County</LOCATION>, 
<PERSON>Hardwick</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm waiting for my opportunity to apprehend it," he said, refusing to disclose 
the location. 
</P>
<P>
The state tightened regulation of venomous reptiles <DATE>July 1</DATE> to require one 
year's experience with the species, but non-venomous snakes such as the 
constricting boas and pythons aren't covered. No permit is needed for 
ownership.

   A giant python known to gobble down
raccoons ``like they were marshmallows'' was finally captured
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> by four men who tunneled under a home to confront the
20-foot, 250-pound snake.
   ``I got close enough to snare it and then we just attacked,''
said <PERSON>Todd Hardwick</PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION>Pesky Critters Relocation</ORGANIZATION> in suburban
<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>. ``It showed no fear of us. It's a proud reptile. He could
have broken our ribs in the flash of an eye.''
   <PERSON>Hardwick</PERSON> believes the python was a pet released years ago in a
nearby park across from <LOCATION>Fort Lauderdale</LOCATION> beach. The animal probably
crawled under the house and caught small animals for food.
   ``The homeowners had been calling people for a month, but no one
wanted to go after it,'' said <PERSON>Hardwick</PERSON>, whose company traps nuisance
animals in <LOCATION>South Florida</LOCATION>. ``People say they've seen it eat 30-pound
raccoons like they were marshmallows.''
   <PERSON>Hardwick</PERSON> believes the snake is the largest ever captured in <LOCATION>South
Florida</LOCATION>, where many exotic pets are illegally released into the wild.
   The reticulate python, a native of southeastern <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>, can grow to more than 30 feet. The snakes, which are not
venomous, coil around their prey to stop breathing and blood flow.
   On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <PERSON>Hardwick</PERSON> and a crew began digging tunnels below the
home. They found the snake about eight feet underground next to a
concrete wall.
   <PERSON>Hardwick</PERSON> said he hooked the snake around the head with a pole
snare. He and his helpers then wrestled it down and yanked it out of
the tunnel.
   ``It was like it was daring us to challenge him,'' said <PERSON>Hardwick</PERSON>.
   He said he hopes to sell the snake to a zoo or serpentarium.

   It's off to the auction block for a
20-foot, 250-pound python known to gobble down raccoons ``like they
were marshmallows'' within the glow of the glitzy <LOCATION>Fort Lauderdale</LOCATION>
beach strip.
   A veteran animal trapper who helped wrestle the snake from under
a home <DATE>Thursday</DATE> said he hopes to get at least <MONEY>$500</MONEY> from a zoo or
nature preserve.
   The snake, which slithered about the residental seaside
neighborhood for years, was stuffed into a sleeping bag after it was
displayed to curious onlookers and news cameras.
   ``He won't have to eat for about a week,'' said <PERSON>Todd Hardwick</PERSON>,
owner of <ORGANIZATION>Pesky Critters Relocation</ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>. ``When it is
time, I might feed him a rabbit.''
   ``We saw the head at first and everyone said, `Wow!''' said <PERSON>Bob
Moxley</PERSON>, a park ranger at <ORGANIZATION>Hugh Taylor Birch State Recreation Area</ORGANIZATION>,
where the snake searched for its prey. ``When it all came out,
everybody just screamed.''
   <PERSON>Hardwick</PERSON> believes the python was a pet released years ago in the
park and probably rested under the house when not hunting for food.
   ``The homeowners had been calling people for a month, but no one

   Homeowner <PERSON>David Spalding</PERSON> said he was unafraid of the reptile, but
he was concerned for others. ``The thing that frightened us was that
he could come out and attack a small child,'' he said.

RAID NETS A NEST OF EXOTIC SNAKES AT SAN CARLOS HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
<LOCATION>San Diego County</LOCATION> animal control officers on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> seized 26 nonpoisonous, 
exotic snakes -- some more than 10 feet long and weighing more than 35 pounds 
-- from a <LOCATION>San Carlos</LOCATION> snake breeder, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The snakes, the majority of them pythons, were confiscated about <TIME>9 a.m.</TIME> from 
<PERSON>Gary Sipperley</PERSON>, at his home in the <DATE>6700</DATE> block of Renkrib Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Some 500 snakes at the house were not seized, but were catalogued by <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> 
Zoo herpetologists -- experts in the study of snakes -- said <PERSON>Sally Hazzard</PERSON>, 
director of the county's animal control department. 
</P>
<P>
Officials seized the snakes along with two poisonous lizards after charging 
Sipperley with violating <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> laws prohibiting the keeping of dangerous or 
poisonous reptiles, including adult boas and pythons more than 3 1/2 feet long 
or weighing more than 15 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
City authorities also are investigating whether Sipperley violated business 
zoning laws. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Potential Danger' 
</P>
<P>
"The snakes were seized for a variety of reasons," <PERSON>Hazzard</PERSON> said. "The rule of 
thumb is (to seize) those that pose potential danger to humans." 
</P>
<P>
Sipperley declined to comment. But a spokeswoman for the <LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION>, where 
the snakes and lizards are being housed temporarily, said such reptiles are not 
necessarily dangerous when in the care of expert breeders. 
</P>
<P>
"None of the snakes were venomous, but all the snakes are definitely over 3 1/2 
feet. It was hard to tell their exact length because they were coiled," said 
<PERSON>Georgeanne Irvine</PERSON>, a zoo official. "Boas and pythons are constricting animals, 
so if they're hungry, they could be dangerous. But if someone knows how to 
handle them, they should be OK." 
</P>
<P>
The reptiles will be kept at the zoo until the county <ORGANIZATION>Department of Animal 
Control</ORGANIZATION> conducts a hearing for Sipperley. Officials said it is uncertain 
whether the breeder will get his snakes and lizards back. 
</P>
<P>
Confiscated were one South American boa constrictor, nine <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> king 
snakes, three pythons from <LOCATION>Sri Lanka</LOCATION>, five Australian pythons, eight rare 
albino Burmese pythons and two beaded lizards, <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION> said. 
</P>
<P>
The seizure, authorized by a search warrant, occurred several weeks after a 
citizen filed a complaint against <ORGANIZATION>Sipperley</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Hazzard</ORGANIZATION> said. She said the 
citizen, who was not identified, feared that the snakes would escape.

<HEAD>Rattlesnake Hunters, Environmentalists Square Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hunters estimate that 500,000 <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> diamondback
rattlesnakes were harvested last year, fetching about <MONEY>$50</MONEY> apiece,
but naturalists say the booming business in rodent-eating snakes is
leading to an environmental bust.
   Rattlesnakes ``are a natural part of the ecology _ it's not like
the communists let them go to terrorize Texans,'' said <PERSON>David
Barker</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> herpetologist, or one who studies reptiles.
``They've been there for a million years.''
   The snakes are in great demand for medical research and
commercial products ranging from exotic trinkets, earrings, belts
and paperweights to <MONEY>$10-per-pound</MONEY> snakeburgers and <MONEY>$40</MONEY> snakeskin
caps.
   Those cashing in on the snake trade are mainly small-time
operators whose numbers have swelled to several thousand since the
``Urban Cowboy'' craze popularized snakeskin attire in the early
<DATE>1980s</DATE>.
   More recently, the oil bust has made snake-hunting an attractive
source of supplemental income _ about <MONEY>$5,000</MONEY> a year for the most
enterprising.
   ``Cowboys, oil wells and snakes are related to <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> _ that's
what people up north think,'' said <PERSON>George Wills</PERSON>, who calls himself
the ``world's largest manufacturer of rattlesnake products.''
   He employs 28 people at a rattlesnake slaughterhouse in <LOCATION>Brady</LOCATION>
where diamondbacks are killed in a miniature guillotine, processed
and turned into offbeat products.
   Wills said his best customers are retailers in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> and other <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> states.
   ``Praise the Lord for <ORGANIZATION>Yankees</ORGANIZATION>, or we couldn't be in the snake
business,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION>Dallas Morning News</ORGANIZATION>.
   But naturalists are warning that the business could be a
disaster for the delicate balance of nature.
   A decrease in their number could lead to an explosion of
disease-carrying rodents and rabbits that cost <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY>
in crop damage, said <PERSON>Jeffrey Black</PERSON>, a professor of biology at
<ORGANIZATION>Oklahoma Baptist University</ORGANIZATION>.
   A decline in the rattlesnake population ``could cause a general
collapse of an ecosystem,'' <PERSON>Barker</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Bill Ransberger</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Sweetwater</LOCATION> snake hunter and handler, has
survived 40 rattlesnake bites. But he says he steers clear of
``those environmentalists.''
   ``You have to be careful with them,'' he said. ``You don't
argue. You just walk away.''
   ``It's hard to get favorable publicity for rattlesnakes,'' said
<PERSON>Jim Seippel</PERSON>, an <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION> engineer who serves as chairman of the legal
affairs committee for the <ORGANIZATION>Greater San Antonio Herpetological
Society</ORGANIZATION>.
   Nonetheless, environmentalists have gone on the offensive. Last
month, 26 <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> animal rights and environmental groups banded
together for the first time to protest a rattlesnake hunt at <ORGANIZATION>Taylor</ORGANIZATION>.
   Two protesters dramatized their concerns by chaining themselves
to a fence. Police responded by throwing a tarp over the
protesters, who soon unchained themselves and went home.
   The consortium of groups is organizing a nationwide
letter-writing campaign directed at the <LOCATION>Texas Parks</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife
Department</ORGANIZATION>. The group's goal, <PERSON>Seippel</PERSON> said, is to encourage the
department to regulate the number of snakes killed and outlaw the
practice of pouring gasoline into logs and animal holes to force
snakes out into the open.
   Snake hunters say they are rendering a service _ ridding the
state of the dangerous reptile, educating crowds who gather at the
roundups and promoting safety.

<HEAD>House Of Reptiles Will Be Limited To Four Snakes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORT COQUITLAM, British Columbia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new law prompted by
<PERSON>Larry Moore</PERSON>'s slithering, squeaking menagerie is forcing him to get
rid of 146 of his snakes.
   Responding to neighbors' complaints about living next door to a
house filled with 150 snakes _ and several hundred rats and mice
needed to feed them _ the municipal council voted <DATE>Monday</DATE> to limit
to four the number of snakes or rodents in a household.
   ``They don't belong in a residential neighborhood; in an urban
setting, 150 of anything is too much,'' said <PERSON>Alderman John Keryluk</PERSON>.
``I wouldn't want to live next door to a house where I know there
are snakes or rodents in large numbers.''
   Keryluk, co-chairman of the council committee that proposed the
bylaw amendment, said <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> keeps his reptiles and rodents in cages.
   ``The concern in the neighborhood is about the rodents or the
snakes breaking loose,'' he said. ``What if an uncaring person were
to break into his house and kick some of the cages apart?''
   <PERSON>Alf Miller</PERSON>, who lives across the street from <PERSON>Moore</PERSON>, said he
complained about the snakes 2{ years ago after he found one in his
yard.
   ``It was over 6 feet long and had a head about the size of an
orange,'' <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> said. ``It was sunning itself half on the wall of
my patio and half on the ground.''
   <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> has a large variety of snakes, but <PERSON>Keryluk</PERSON> said he
believes none is venomous.
   <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> did not return messages left on his home answering machine.
   The amendment to the animal regulation bylaw, which excludes pet
stores and schools, also prohibits venomous snakes.

THIS EXOTIC EXTERMINATOR -- THE BROWN TREE SNAKE -- HAS CAUSED A MAJOR 
ECOLOGICAL CATASTROPHE ON AN ISLAND ONCE FILLED WITH THE SOUND OF RARE BIRDS

<P>
On <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>, the tropical <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> island halfway between <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Guinea</LOCATION>, a 
recent survey of hospital emergency room records reads like a horror show 
script. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for instance, the case of a 2-month-old baby treated and released in 
<DATE>March</DATE>. Her father checked on the sleeping infant at <TIME>1 a.m.</TIME> and found a 5-foot 
snake wrapped around her neck and chewing on her arm. 
</P>
<P>
That same month, a middle-aged woman was treated for a similar problem. Her 
situation rivaled the shower scene in "Psycho": She was sitting on the toilet 
when a snake, entering the house from the septic system, lunged out of the 
water of the toilet bowl and struck her where she least expected it. 
</P>
<P>
Guam's only native snake is a harmless, blind reptile that resembles an 
earthworm. But unbeknown to the military during World War II, ships carrying 
wartime supplies to <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Guinea</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Solomon Islands</LOCATION> 
also brought unwanted stowaways: brown tree snakes native to those areas that 
grow to 13 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
Without the natural enemies like the predatory birds found in its native lands, 
the snake's numbers on <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> have exploded to more than 6,000 per square mile, 
according to <PERSON>Thomas Fritts</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> fish and wildlife specialist in reptiles. 
And in the space of a few decades, the snakes have eaten almost all of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>'s 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time we discovered there was a problem, the snakes were totally out of 
control," said <PERSON>Fritts</PERSON>, who has been studying the snakes in an effort -- 
fruitless so far -- to control their numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Because the brown tree snake is not highly venomous, most people quickly 
recover from bites. But doctors see only part of the problem caused by the 
reptiles. The agile climbers slither up power lines and short-circuit wires, 
causing frequent blackouts that cost <MONEY>Guam millions of dollars</MONEY> a year. Young 
snakes pop out of automobile air-conditioning vents and scare drivers; some of 
the island's 121,000 residents have awakened to find the snakes in their beds. 
</P>
<P>
But worst of all, the nocturnal snakes eat almost anything and can slither 
almost anywhere, including along branches where birds and fruit bats roost, 
into holes where lizards hide and deep into hollow tree crevices where many 
bird species once laid eggs unmolested. 
</P>
<P>
The snakes' victims include two species that existed nowhere else on earth, the 
<LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> flycatcher and the <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> rail, both of which were once so abundant they 
were legally hunted. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole time I was on <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>, I never heard a bird sound," said <ORGANIZATION>University of 
Connecticut</ORGANIZATION> ornithologist <PERSON>Robert Craig</PERSON>, who is studying the bird life of the 
<LOCATION>Marianas Islands</LOCATION>, which include <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>. It was, he recalls, reminiscent of <PERSON>Rachel 
Carson</PERSON>'s book, "Silent Spring": "not a song, not a sound." 
</P>
<P>
Of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>'s 18 species of native birds, at least six have been wiped off the 
island since <DATE>1970</DATE>; <PERSON>Julie Savidge</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>University of Nebraska</ORGANIZATION> ecologist, has 
watched several of these species disappear during the course of her six-year 
study, while most others have become increasingly rare. "I was shocked at the 
decline," she said. "This is an example showing just how rapidly extinction can 
occur and the devastating effects exotic species can have." 
</P>
<P>
Because of their tree-climbing, night-traveling habits, the snakes went mostly 
unnoticed for the first few decades after they arrived. But today they are so 
numerous and so widespread that "eradication is way out of reach now," <PERSON>Fritts</PERSON> 
said. He estimates that in some areas, there may be as many as 12,000 tree 
snakes per square mile. "But control is possible," <PERSON>Fritts</PERSON> said. "First, we have 
to learn everything we can about the snake to find its weak point." 
</P>
<P>
When <PERSON>Savidge</PERSON> began her study in <DATE>1982</DATE>, no one really thought the snakes were a 
problem. No introduced reptile has been implicated in causing the extinction of 
a native animal. But that the snakes were at fault became quickly apparent as 
<PERSON>Savidge</PERSON> observed the secretive reptile's night feeding habits: She found that 
the snakes eat birds, bird eggs, lizards and small mammals -- even puppies, 
gripping them with powerful constricting muscles and then chewing on them until 
their flesh reaches the back of the snake's mouth, where its venomous fangs 
lie. 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife researchers are struggling for a solution. Savidge went as far as to 
pass out recipes for snake to people on the streets -- sweet and sour snake, 
snake adobo -- but they never caught on. Besides, <PERSON>Fritts</PERSON> said, the snakes are 
so numerous that even a bounty program probably won't help. 
</P>
<P>
Fritts hopes that further studies of the snake will yield an attracting 
chemical (to use in mass traps), repellent or fumigant. Eventually he hopes to 
establish some snake-free reserves for threatened species. 
</P>
<P>
A few of the rails and kingfishers were removed from the wild before they 
became extinct and are now being bred in zoos in hopes of reintroducing them to 
such reserves on <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> some day. But at the moment, efforts are focused on 
preventing the snakes' spread, like a malignant disease, from <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> to other 
islands. 
</P>
<P>
Ornithologist <PERSON>Craig</PERSON> is particularly worried about the birds on the other 14 
islands of the <LOCATION>Marianas</LOCATION> chain. Each island he's visited hosts bird species 
found nowhere else. If the tree snakes arrived on these islands, he said, "the 
loss to science would be devastating." 
</P>
<P>
It's not an unlikely scenario. Within the <DATE>last 10 years</DATE>, <PERSON>Fritts</PERSON> said, the 
snakes have shown up twice on <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, and also on Kwajalein, an island 1,000 
miles east of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>, as well as <PERSON>Diego Garcia</PERSON>, an atoll in the <LOCATION>Indian Ocean</LOCATION>, and 
the islands of <LOCATION>Saipan</LOCATION> and Ponapi. All these snakes, which apparently found 
their way onto cargo ships, have either been killed or failed to establish a 
breeding population on these islands. 
</P>
<P>
Fritts and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> colleagues have begun offering technical briefings at 
Micronesian and <LOCATION>Marianas</LOCATION> ports to teach inspectors how to look for the snakes 
in high-risk cargo like junk cars, lumber and government surplus property, 
where the snakes can easily hide. Such inspectors are already trained to look 
for agricultural pests and contraband, <PERSON>Fritts</PERSON> said, "but they aren't trained to 
look for snakes." No one envies them the job, "but somebody has got to do it." 
</P>
<P>

extinction:

LIZARD LADY LIKES TO RUN WITH PARTY ANIMALS 
</P>

<P>
In search of entertainment for the young guests at her 4-year-old son's 
birthday party, <PERSON>Ann Shapiro</PERSON> wanted something different. 
</P>
<P>
"I have an older daughter, so I've gone through all the clowns and different 
things. The kids don't always appreciate the clowns. I wanted something I knew 
he would really enjoy," <PERSON>Shapiro</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION> Parent magazine, she saw an ad for the Lizard Lady -- <PERSON>Melanie Pickrell</PERSON>, 
36, of <PERSON>Van Nuys</PERSON>, who brings an entourage of snakes and lizards to children's 
parties -- and <PERSON>Shapiro</PERSON> knew she had found the perfect entertainment for her 
dinosaur-obsessed son. 
</P>
<P>
At the party, about 12 children sat enthralled for an hour as <PERSON>Pickrell</PERSON> showed 
them a 7 1/2-foot-long Burmese python, a Dumerils lizard, skinny brightly 
colored milk snakes, corn snakes, tortoises, a chameleon and other reptiles. 
</P>
<P>
"Chameleons are white when they are sick, green when they are relaxed, and 
green and black when they are nervous. Now watch as she changes colors," 
<PERSON>Pickrell</PERSON>, a part-time preschool teacher, instructed the children. The tiny 
triceratops-shaped creature's skin, initially a pure bright green, transformed 
into a black-and-green circular pattern. 
</P>
<P>
The children, crowding close to see and touch each reptile, oohed and aahed 
appreciatively at each new discovery. "They're beautiful!" birthday boy <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> 
cried in delight. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Pickrell</PERSON> said her hourlong snake display, which costs <MONEY>$100</MONEY>, has elicited 
similar responses at each of the nearly 30O children's parties where she has 
performed since she began in <DATE>August</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids love it," <PERSON>Pickrell</PERSON> said. "They don't have the preconceived ideas 
about snakes that we do. They love dinosaurs, and reptiles are like dinosaurs." 
</P>
<P>
Pickrell works part time at <ORGANIZATION>All Children Great and Small</ORGANIZATION> preschool in <LOCATION>Los 
Feliz</LOCATION>, where she came up with the idea for the Lizard Lady when she saw how 
much the youngsters loved studying reptiles. 
</P>
<P>
At first, <PERSON>Pickrell</PERSON> borrowed most of the animals for her show from <LOCATION>Slither City</LOCATION>, 
a Van Nuys pet shop specializing in snakes, lizards, bugs and other unusual 
pets. Eventually, she decided to buy her own because the store kept selling off 
her favorites. She has been known to borrow an occasional reptile at a client's 
request. 
</P>
<P>
Despite some parents' laughing speculation ("What would happen if she forgets 
something and leaves it in your house?"), <PERSON>Pickrell</PERSON> said the snakes are not a 
threat to the children. She has not had a snake bite nor had a snake slither 
out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Really Tame' 
</P>
<P>
"There is a difference between a tame animal and a wild animal, and these are 
really tame," <PERSON>Pickrell</PERSON> said. "Snakes don't bite to eat people, they bite to 
defend themselves, and these snakes know that people aren't going to hurt them. 
They are used to people feeding them, being around them." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Shapiro</PERSON> said she was not concerned that some of her son's friends could have 
been afraid of the creatures, and she did not give advance warning on the 
invitations. 
</P>
<P>
"Younger kids have a lot of animals in their classrooms, so they are used to 
different animals," she said. "I didn't want to tell them too far in advance 
because then they might get wound up about it. I wanted to let it happen 
naturally and let them enjoy it."

   Flooding forced many snakes into populated areas,
but experts asked residents to restrain their fears and spare the
reptiles, many of which eat rodents.
   ``There's a lot of harmless species in the <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> area. The ones
that are left alone will return to their homes as soon as they can
because they tend to live in the same place all their lives,'' said
<PERSON>Ardell Mitchell</PERSON>, reptile supervisor at the <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> Zoo.
   And experts say the snakes may be doing homeowners a favor,
since <DATE>last week</DATE>'s flooding, caused by heavy rainstorms, may also
have forced a few rodents to higher ground.
   Harmless <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> rat snakes, diamondback and blotched water
snakes, which can grow to more than 3 feet long, are the most
common species in the area. But some areas of <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> have venomous
copperheads and diamondback rattlesnakes.

   Thieves who stole eight snakes from the <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> zoo
picked the most valuable snakes and the easiest to handle,
authorities said.
   The snakes, worth about <MONEY>$8,000</MONEY>, were reported missing <DATE>Saturday</DATE>
<TIME>morning</TIME>. Workers found no sign of forced entry at the Bird and
Reptile Building and lids still covered the snakes' cages, some of
which were found latched, suggesting the snakes did not escape.
   ``The thing is it's just these specific snakes that were
taken,'' said <PERSON>Victoria Furber</PERSON>, zoo spokeswoman. ``We figure that
somebody knew what they were doing and just went after some of the
most valuable snakes in that section.''
   Gone were three ringed pythons, three carpet pythons and two
endangered <ORGANIZATION>Dumeril</ORGANIZATION>'s ground boas.
   <PERSON>Ardell Mitchell</PERSON>, animal care manager for the zoo's reptile
department, said the snakes probably were taken for resale to
underground pet traders or collectors.
   ``These little snakes that were taken may bite, but it wouldn't
hurt at all. So they took the easy ones to handle,'' <PERSON>Mitchell</PERSON> said.
The stolen snakes were between 2 and 3 feet long.
   The loss of the boas, which were brother and sister, especially
worried zoo officials, <PERSON>Ms. Furber</PERSON> said. The snakes came from
<LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> and are listed as an endangered species because their
forest habitat is being destroyed.
   ``They're pretty valuable animals,'' <PERSON>Mitchell</PERSON> said. ``I'd hate
for them to go off and sit in someone's garage somewhere.''

   Some people's idea of Yuletide fun is to watch
the waiter bite the head off a live viper and pluck out the
still-squirming serpent's bladder. The slippery green organ is then
eaten raw.
   Sure, not everyone will cotton to that bitter flavor, but they
say snake enhances sexual prowess, so what's not to like?
   For one thing, snakes may be threatened with extinction, <LOCATION>Hong
Kong</LOCATION>'s government has declared.
   On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, the government adopted a law that requires snake
dealers to apply for import and export licences for king cobras,
Asiatic cobras and Oriental rat snakes. Failure to comply could
bring fines of up to <MONEY>$3,200</MONEY> and up to six months in jail.
   Chan Ping-kwong, spokesman for the Agriculture and <ORGANIZATION>Fisheries
Department</ORGANIZATION>, said the government would collect data on snake imports
to make sure the reptiles aren't in danger of extinction.
   More than 100,000 snakes are imported by <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> each year,
mostly from <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Chan</PERSON> said.
   Serpent eating is a feature of social life in the British
colony, especially during <DATE>winter</DATE> when the vipers are reportedly
tastiest, having gorged themselves to prepare for hibernation.
   Snake soup is a staple of business banquets this time of year,
and trade unions are organizing year-end snake feasts to kick off
an election campaign for the legislature and other local offices
next year.
   The most common snake dish is a soup, cooked with mushrooms,
bamboo shoots and dried orange peels. The potion is reputed to
speed the metabolism and improve male sexual performance.
   Another favorite, snakes' skin soaked in malt wine, is believed
to have calming effects similar to that of tranquilizers.
   Perhaps the most spectacular way of eating snake is swallowing
raw bladders. The dark green organ is extremely slippery and has an
intensely bitter taste.
   To show how fresh their product is, <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> vendors bite the
snake's head off in front of customers, who get to watch the body
of the reptile wriggle through the vendor's fingers as he searches
for the organ.
   The conservation organization World Wide Fund For Nature said it
supported the government's licensing decision.
   ``If unrestricted trade continues, snakes will one day become
endangered,'' said <PERSON>Amy Lau</PERSON>, the fund's conservation officer in <LOCATION>Hong
Kong</LOCATION>.
   Snake trader <PERSON>Tam Sun</PERSON>, who runs a small shop in downtown <LOCATION>Hong
Kong</LOCATION> that sells snake soup, said he has no choice but to pass on
the cost of the new import license to his customers, who now pay <MONEY>$2</MONEY>
for a bowl.
   ``Our profit margin is already pretty narrow,'' <PERSON>Tam</PERSON> said, after
biting off the head of a green snake. ``Prices of snake soup will
go up <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT>.''

Rounding Up Rattlers: A Town Tradition

<TEXT>
   Three men moved slowly along the lip of the canyon, their shadows falling below them, stretching long and dark across a long meadow carpeted in lush green grass and dotted with crimson <ORGANIZATION>Hereford</ORGANIZATION> cattle grazing peacefully in the early morning sun. 

   Eyes on the ground, each man peered into the crevices and recesses of the white, porous gypsum boulders and into the inner depths of the scattered scrub brush that sprouts near the break where canyon meets plateau. 

   <PERSON>Anthony Felder</PERSON>, the leader of the three, parted the leaved branches of a stubby wild plum and was the first to find the object of their quest. 
"There's one here," announced <PERSON>Mr. Felder</PERSON>, "but I doubt we'll get it. 
All I can see is about the last six inches sticking out of a hole." 

   The three converged on the spot, planned a strategy and went to work. 
Using yard-long metal rods equipped with controllable, grasping tongs, each hunter scrambled to grasp his prey. 

   The battle went undecided for several tense minutes before <PERSON>Virgil Pugh</PERSON> announced, "I've got him. . . . 
Everybody stand back." 
<PERSON>Mr. Pugh</PERSON> lifted hard, swinging his catch over his head. 
Turning, he deposited 3 1/2 feet of wrist-thick, enraged diamondback rattlesnake onto a slab of ivory gypsum. 

   The men stood for a few minutes and admired the coiled snake. 
<PERSON>Mr. Pugh</PERSON> took time to show the newcomer of the three the clear yellow venom that streaked down his catcher from the snake's repeated strikes. 

   Eventually, <PERSON>Mr. Pugh</PERSON> pinned the diamond's head to the rock with the metal instrument, grasped it between his thumb and forefinger and barehanded the twisting snake into a pillowcase. 
The excitement behind them, the hunt went on. 

   "This is my 24th year," said <PERSON>Mr. Pugh</PERSON>, a speech pathologist from <LOCATION>Colwich</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kan</LOCATION>. 
"I started it as a dare but you can get hooked. 
I take a week's vacation and come down here to hunt with friends. 
It's kind of like a class reunion. 
But I guess the thrill of it is what attracts me. 
These things can be hazardous to your health." 

   But rattlesnake hunting is more than just a sport for a courageous few around this tiny central <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> town. 
It is a tradition. 

   "I guess I've been hunting rattlesnakes for 46 years, since I was 14, and that's probably true of about every kind around," said <PERSON>Mr. Felder</PERSON>, a lifelong resident. 
"It's part of a tradition. 
Big brother did it, Dad did it and most kids naturally want to get out and try to find a snake bigger than they did." 

   According to <PERSON>Mr. Felder</PERSON>, the gypsum canyons that lie in the petroleum and ranching country west of town offer optimum habitat for Western diamondback rattlesnakes. 
The poisonous reptiles thrive thanks to the little caverns that sound hollow underfoot and reach far back from the lips of the canyons. 

   Local hunters, such as <PERSON>Mr. Felder</PERSON>, know the locations of such dens and hunt the area around their usually small openings. 
During the course of a year the best dens produce an amazing number of snakes. 

   "During the average day it's not too uncommon not to catch any snakes but it's not uncommon to catch as many as 14 or 15," said <PERSON>Mr. Felder</PERSON>. 
"I've had days when two of us have caught as many as 40 from just a few dens. 
The most I know of coming from one den, at one time, is somewhere over 30. but you can go to these same dens the next day and still catch more snakes." 

   A new season begins with the first tepid afternoons of <DATE>January</DATE> when the rattlers slither to the surface to warm in the sun, and lasts until the heat of <DATE>summer</DATE> forces the cold-blooded creatures to be nocturnal. 

   The town that locals affectionately refer to as "Okeene America" remains mostly ambivalent toward the hunts most of the year. 

   On a recent <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, regulars gathered at The Galvanized Palace, talking of things common to towns of 1,300. 
Outside the tavern teen-agers, fresh from school, cruised the three-block business district, exchanging waves with friends and strangers alike. 

   And things would be the same the following <DATE>Monday</DATE>, but not so during the two days in between. 
Two blocks of Main Street would be roped off, concessionaires would line the sidewalks and an estimated 5,000 people would come to attend the 47th Okeene Rattlesnake Round-Up. 
Sponsored by the local Jaycees, the Round-Up draws people from nearly two dozen states as well as an occasional foreign country. 

   Some come for hunting, renting equipment and following local guides into the canyon country where they search for, and usually find, rattlesnakes. 
But more than <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> of those who attend come only as spectators drawn by the unusual. 

   For them there are the stands, selling an assortment of rattlesnake products ranging from <MONEY>$1</MONEY> rattles to <MONEY>$300</MONEY> boots, and the carnival-like snake shows. 
And there are the cornmeal-coated "snake steaks" that one newcomer rated as having "a good flavor but not much meat," as she rolled the bony skeleton between her fingers. 

   Admittedly, many come for the mystery and the danger that surround the creatures. 
People stand seemingly spellbound as handlers measure and auction off the largest of the entries, snakes that come from both local dens and from across the South, routinely measuring five and six feet in length. 

   At times spectators pack "the butcher shop" where Jaycees turn live rattlesnakes into packaged meat as well as souvenir heads, skins and rattles. 

   The main event of the Round-Up is officially billed "The Den of Death," but locals call it "the pit." 
They're talking about an enclosure made from eight sheets of plywood and filled with several hundred rattling snakes. 
Spectators line the perimeter, watching handlers such as Messrs. 
<PERSON>Felder</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pugh</PERSON> pick up and show off the reptiles. 
It is here where most of the danger lies. 

   "Nearly all of the bites that occur happen in the pit," said <PERSON>Mr. Felder</PERSON>, taking a break from a turn with the snakes. 
"You say it'll happen to somebody else but it's inevitable. 
I've been bitten twice but some guys get it a lot more than that. 

   "Our wives have to be super ladies to put up with what we do," continued <PERSON>Mr. Felder</PERSON>, a religious and dedicated family man. 
"Now I know how my parents must have felt. 
My 18-year-old son has been getting into the pit for two years. 
There were three bites at a roundup in <LOCATION>Sweetwater</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, this year. 
One of them died -- he was only 20 years old." 

   Later that day the younger <PERSON>Felder</PERSON> did get hit by a striking snake. 
Luckily, the venomous fangs didn't penetrate the legs of his jeans. 
"That's probably the best thing that could have happened to him," commented the father. 
"It'll give him a whole new respect for the snakes. 
It's probably postponed his getting bit for another five years."

Describing the reptilian horde as a "scene out of an <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> Jones movie," <LOCATION>San 
Diego</LOCATION> Zoo officials <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> were trying to identify the 225 nonpoisonous 
snakes impounded at a vacant Vista residence. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, county officials wondered why the owner apparently abandoned the 
valuable creatures. 
</P>
<P>
Officers from the <ORGANIZATION>San Diego County Department of Animal Control</ORGANIZATION> seized the 
snakes <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> on <ORGANIZATION>Lado de Loma Drive</ORGANIZATION> after neighbors complained of a stench to 
the county <ORGANIZATION>Sheriff's Department</ORGANIZATION>. Deputies entered the house, found several dead 
snakes among the poorly tended live ones, and called in animal control 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
While neither the county nor the <ORGANIZATION>Sheriff's Department</ORGANIZATION> could identify the 
snakes' owner as of <DATE>late Wednesday</DATE>, a former owner of the house said he sold 
the residence in early <DATE>December</DATE> to <PERSON>James R. King</PERSON> of <LOCATION>El Cajon</LOCATION>, who reportedly 
described himself to a real estate agent as a "reptile wholesaler." 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reach King at an <ORGANIZATION>El Cajon</ORGANIZATION> telephone listing were unsuccessful 
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The haul included 225 live snakes, about a dozen dead ones, 20 exotic species 
of frogs and a handful of lizards, said <PERSON>Sally Hazzard</PERSON>, county animal control 
director. The animals, which apparently had not been given food or water for 
some time, were turned over to the temporary custody of the zoo <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> 
<TIME>morning</TIME> for veterinary care and identification. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the snakes were found <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> night in plastic foam cups and plastic 
containers, zoo spokesman <PERSON>Jeff Jouett</PERSON> said. The reptiles "were all extremely 
thirsty and went immediately to the water when it was put in their pens" at the 
zoo, he said. Jouett described some of the baby snakes as dehydrated. 
</P>
<P>
Notations were made on some of the snakes' pens that indicated to zoo officials 
that the animals may have last been fed and watered <DATE>Nov. 9</DATE>, <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The owner may face criminal charges if the county determines that the snakes 
were mistreated, <ORGANIZATION>Vista Assistant City</ORGANIZATION> Manager <PERSON>Jeanette Farris</PERSON> said. The owner 
may be in misdemeanor violation of a Vista law that prohibits homeowners from 
keeping more than 25 snakes or from owning pythons or boa constrictors longer 
than 3 1/2 feet or weighing more than 15 pounds, she said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said the haul of snakes included a crate full of "20 or more" pythons 
and boa constrictors that range from 5 to 12 feet in length. 
</P>
<P>
Although the snakes "appeared to be abandoned," Deputy <PERSON>Sheriff Larry van Dusen</PERSON> 
said law enforcement officials would not try to identify or locate the snakes' 
owner unless the animal control department determines that there may have been 
criminal neglect of the animals. 
</P>
<P>
Hazzard said her department is awaiting the zoo's medical evaluation and 
identification of the animals before fully assessing the case. 
</P>
<P>
Zoning laws that govern what kinds of animals may be kept in given areas and 
the required "methods of containment" must also be evaluated by the county, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"No one knows how long the animals have been abandoned," <PERSON>Hazzard</PERSON> said. "But 
there is criminal liability, in general, if an owner does not provide adequate 
food, water and shelter for their animals." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, animal control officers posted a notice at the <ORGANIZATION>Vista</ORGANIZATION> house 
saying that the reptiles' owner must come forward within five days to claim the 
animals or forfeit ownership. After that, the county would be free to sell the 
snakes at auction, or dispose of them to zoos or the state <ORGANIZATION>Department of Fish</ORGANIZATION> 
and Game, <ORGANIZATION>Hazzard</ORGANIZATION> said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the zoo has not yet finished identifying the reptiles, <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> 
described them as all nonpoisonous. The snakes identified include rare, 
12-foot-long albino Burmese pythons and albino king snakes, as well as a 
variety of king snakes, rat snakes, garter snakes and rosy boa constrictors. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Gary Sipperley</PERSON>, owner of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Reptile Breeders, said adult albino Burmese 
pythons could be worth up to <MONEY>$4,000</MONEY> each. The albino pythons "are a fairly new 
genetic strain that's become available in the last five years. That's why 
they're so valuable. There aren't that many available at this point."

<P>
Seventh-graders at <ORGANIZATION>Rancho San Joaquin Intermediate School</ORGANIZATION> have been fascinated 
by life science instructor <PERSON>Bill W. Anderson</PERSON>'s "teaching tools" -- animals of 
all kinds, including a 15-foot python, caged cockateels, wild deer mice, exotic 
fish and more in two rooms used to expose his pupils to wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
But in one corner, next to a wall covered with clippings from science 
magazines, a glass aquarium marked "Haitian Boa" sits empty. The two specimens 
that had lived there were among <MONEY>$2,200</MONEY> worth of reptiles stolen from the <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION> 
classroom earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
"They took some really unusual king snakes that you can't legally buy in 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> said. An albino corn snake and a western hognose snake 
also were among the 23 snakes, 3 turtles and 2 lizards stolen <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, he said. 
Only about 15 of the reptiles remain. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Irvine Police</ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON>Pat Rodgers</PERSON> said the suspects pried the classroom door open 
with a blunt object sometime between <TIME>midnight</TIME> and <TIME>8 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. Officers were 
unable to find any usable fingerprints <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, but they are still 
investigating the case. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> said he had bought many of the missing reptiles with his own money. 
Others he had found under rocks while on trips or morning runs. He added that 
he spends much of his free time collecting and caring for the animals that 
bring "life" to his science classes. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what I love, and I put <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> into what I do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the elaborate exhibit, he said, is that most of his students, 
about age 12, aren't really interested in "the booky stuff." But if they can be 
made interested by looking at the actual creatures, "that's when they'll read," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's approach seems to work. On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, students were planning a "snake 
dance" and a candy sale to replace some of the stolen animals, school officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
During class <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> lifted one of the remaining snakes, a 15-foot 
python, from its temporary home -- a green garbage pail, for about 35 wide-eyed 
students. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look inside his mouth," he said, holding the snake by its neck, "you'll 
see a little hole. That's his breathing tube." 
</P>
<P>
"Hey <PERSON>Mr. Anderson</PERSON>," one pupil called out. "What does that guy eat?" 
</P>
<P>
Rabbits and chickens and such, <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> responded. But watching the reptiles 
eat is an experience he reserves for his advanced students. "A lot of the kids 
couldn't handle it," he explained.

   GUAM -- Tourist advisory: While in Guam, keep your toilet
seat down when not in use.
   Snakes like to come in through the toilets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At night, they hang from trees like fat, brown strands of
cooked spaghetti. They attack <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military bases. They
slither up power poles. They wipe out entire bird
populations, attack children and crawl into homes looking for
food. Some are 10 feet long. And they're so tough they
actually can bump up against an electrified fence and keep
coming back for more.
   This is really gross.
   There are as many as three million snakes here on a land
mass of 212 square miles. That's an average of 14,000 snakes
per square mile, or 22 snakes for every man, woman and child.
Now, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government, armed with <MONEY>$1.5 million</MONEY> from
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, is mounting a counterattack. Wildlife biologist
<PERSON>Thomas Fritts</PERSON> and a team of researchers have been zapping the
snakes silly in experimental electric corrals, luring them
into traps, testing fumigants and trying to figure out if, in
the case of snakes, sex can kill. If all else fails, they
figure maybe at least they can establish some "snake-free
zones."
   What makes this research work so difficult is the nature
of the foe. "Boiga irregularis" -- known as a brown tree
snake -- lives in trees but is equally adept on the ground,
so it's difficult to keep the snake in or out of any large
area. The snakes are hard to starve out because they will
dine on any small critter.
   Indigenous to the <LOCATION>Solomon Islands</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Guinea</LOCATION> and northern
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, the snakes first turned up in <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> shortly after
World War II, apparently as stowaways on a cargo ship. They
proliferate maddeningly fast because they have no natural
predators on <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>. For decades, the snakes were mostly
unnoticed, content to devour lizards and birds. But by the
early <DATE>1980s</DATE> local biologists discovered the snakes had wiped
out nine of 12 native birds species, critically depleted the
rest and had run so low on lizards that they began foraging
in homes for more varied food.
   "Two snakes came through the commode of my home the other
day," says <PERSON>Marilyn D.A. Manibusan</PERSON>, a territorial senator. "I
threw boiling water at them." A lot of people put screens
over their sewer vents to keep the snakes from entering via
the toilet.
   By day, the nocturnal snakes seem to disappear. Indeed,
many people in <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> say they've never seen one. But the
snakes, which are mildly poisonous, have been found coiled
around screaming infants, their mouths locked on tiny hands
in vain attempts to swallow the babies. Though no known
deaths have resulted, 53 emergency room cases of snakebites
were reported in the <ORGANIZATION>Guam Memorial Hospital</ORGANIZATION> between <DATE>1986</DATE> and
<DATE>1989</DATE>, including four in which doctors said infant victims
came perilously close to death.
   The problem finally drew widespread public attention after
the snakes began crawling over power lines and electrocuting
themselves, knocking out power in the process. Between <DATE>1978</DATE>
and <DATE>1990</DATE>, <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> was hit by an estimated 680 snake-related
outages, in some cases blacking out the entire island.
Exasperated, the <ORGANIZATION>Guam Power Authority</ORGANIZATION> wound up turning off
from dusk to dawn a utility pole that had suffered 17 faults,
effectively ceding it to the snakes.
   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military soon found out itself that the reptile
is a resourceful opponent. At one base, commanders ordered
the bottoms of power poles wrapped with sleeves of slick
metal in hopes of keeping the snakes off. They were chagrined
to later discover the snakes don't even go up the poles; they
prefer the supporting guy wires. So the next tack was to
erect screen-wire barriers around the guy wires. The snakes
simply climbed over.
   So, what to do?
   <PERSON>Gordon Rodda</PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION>Arizona Cooperative Fish</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife
Research Unit</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION>, tried to build a better snake trap.
He tried using lizards, chicken litter and quail as bait, but
found that white mice work best. "If you put out 100 traps
with quail bait, you find six snakes in them, but with white
mice you find 25 snakes out of 100 traps," he says.
   The downside: "We don't really want to import a million
white mice to <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>," says <PERSON>Mr. Fritts</PERSON>. So <PERSON>Mr. Fritts</PERSON> says the
researchers hope to come up with an artificial white mouse
that can be used in its place.
   In fact, just about every solution seems to have a catch.
Officials considered importing mongooses or paying a bounty
on dead snakes. But mongooses hunt by day and sleep by <TIME>night</TIME>
-- opposite of the snakes -- and <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> officials concluded
that a bounty would only encourage enterprising entrepreneurs
to start raising snakes commercially.
   <PERSON>Earl Campbell</PERSON>, a researcher with the <ORGANIZATION>Ohio Cooperative Fish</ORGANIZATION>
and <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Research Unit</ORGANIZATION>, has designed electrified snake
fences that carry 8,000 volts. He says he has sat up <TIME>night
after night</TIME> watching surrounded snakes zap themselves -- and
then zap themselves again. In the long run, though, "the
mortality rate is <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT>," he says. But the fences are expensive
and can only be used in small areas, perhaps such as the
airport and port. They could also be used to create a few
snake-free <PERSON>Edens</PERSON>.
   Great hopes are also being placed on work being done by
<PERSON>Peter Savarie</PERSON>, a Denver-based research pharmacologist with
the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION>. He says methyl bromide,
in appropriate doses, kills the snakes. But that also could
only be used in small areas, and requires trained personnel.
   A snake-killing virus is one idea, but no one knows yet
which virus would do the trick. Another possibility is using
sex pheromones to attract snakes into a designated "poison
station," where they could be killed off. Great idea, except
no one knows for sure that the snakes are actually attracted
by such sex lures.
   As biologist <PERSON>Fritts</PERSON> says: "Each line of research may have
some place, but no one of them is going to solve the
problem."
   Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>Guam's Division of Aquatic</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife
Resources</ORGANIZATION> is pushing its own modest proposal: recipes for
brown tree snake, such as snake meat in coconut milk,
deep-fried snake and sweet-and-sour snake. "I haven't eaten
it personally," says wildlife biologist <PERSON>Michael McCoid</PERSON>, "but
people who have say it's tasty, like" -- you guessed it --
"chicken."

   It's harder work being a snake than scientists
once believed.
   <ORGANIZATION>Three University of California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION>, scientists studying the
energy cost of locomotion report that it takes as much energy for a
snake to undulate along the ground as does for an animal with legs
to walk.
   This, says <PERSON>Bruce Jayne</PERSON>, a coauthor of a study published <DATE>today</DATE> in
Science, is contrary to what scientists have long believed.
   ``Our findings do not support the widely held notion that the
energetic cost of terrestrial locomotion by limbless animals is
less than that of limbed animals,'' he said.
   In plain language, it is as hard to wiggle along as it is to
walk along. Or it takes as much energy to slither as it does to
stroll.
   To find out how hard a snake has to work to get from one place
to another, <PERSON>Jayne</PERSON> and his colleagues got a group of black racer
snakes and figured out a way to put them through an aerobic workout.
   First, the three-foot-long snakes were fitted with little clear
plastic masks. Leading from each mask was a hose that would collect
the exhaled reptilian breath.
   Then the snakes, one by one, were put on a treadmill _ or,
perhaps, it was a slithermill.
   Anyway, once placed on the device a snake crawled like crazy to
keep up with the surface moving under it. As it worked, the snake's
exhaled breath was drawn through the hose and into a machine that
measured the oxygen content.
   How much oxygen was depleted from the breath, said <PERSON>Jayne</PERSON>, was a
measure of the amount of energy the snake needed to slither along.
   The scientists then compared the results with similar studies of
limbed animals, such as lizards, of the same mass, or weight. The
energy used by both the footed and the fanged was about the same,
they discovered.
   <PERSON>Jayne</PERSON> said the study casts doubt on a long-held notion about the
evolution of limbless land animals, such as snakes and some legless
lizards.
   ``One explanation for the evolutionary loss of limbs has been
that it was energetically less expensive,'' he said. Scientists,
said <PERSON>Jayne</PERSON>, have suggested that being legless gave some animals an
advantage because it was thought to require less energy to move
like a snake than to walk on legs.
   Now, he said, that theory no longer seems valid.
   <PERSON>Jayne</PERSON> said the undulating motion of a snake on a flat surface is
only one of several ways the reptile can move.
   Another method is used when a snake crawls through a tunnel
wider than its body, but not wide enough to slither.
   For such a place, snakes use what is called a concertina motion.
   This movement involves bunching up the lower body and then
extending the head forward. Then the upper body is bunched up and
the tail pulled forward.
   To test the energy need for this motion, <PERSON>Jayne</PERSON> and his team
built a tunnel treadmill and the snakes worked out as before with
their exhaled breath measured.
   ``Concertina locomotion is very expensive (in energy use),''
said <PERSON>Jayne</PERSON>. He said it was ``far and away more expensive than
virtually all other kinds of locomotion.''
   <PERSON>Jayne</PERSON> said the black racers used in the experiments lived up to
their names. In a short bursts, he said, the snakes were able to
slither at more than four miles an hour. Typically, though, they
worked at a speed of half a mile an hour, or less. For the
concertina locomotion, the typical speed dropped to less than 200
feet an hour.
   The scientists got their test subjects from an animals supply
house, but black racers are common snakes in the southeastern
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. They eat small rodents, birds and lizards and
typically keep away from humans. They are not poisonous, but, as
<PERSON>Jayne</PERSON> learned, they can bite.
   ``Sometimes when I would get them out of their cages, they would
nip me,'' he said.
   How do you get a snake to start a treadmill workout?
   ``You could just touch their tail or wave your hand and off
they'd go,'' said the scientist.
   Jayne's coauthors in the study were <PERSON>Albert Bennett</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michael
Walton</PERSON>. Science, which published the study, is the journal of the
<ORGANIZATION>American Association</ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION>Advancement of Science</ORGANIZATION>.

SNAKE BITES THE HAND THAT'S FREEZING IT

Aveteran snake handler at the <LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION> was bitten <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by a venomous 
mole viper, the first such incident in the zoo's history, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Charles W. Radcliffe</PERSON>, 48, who has worked at the zoo three years and previously 
handled snakes at zoos in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> and Ft. Worth, <LOCATION>Tex.</LOCATION>, was listed in good 
condition <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> night in the intensive care unit of <ORGANIZATION>UC San Diego Medical 
Center</ORGANIZATION>. Hospital officials said they expect <ORGANIZATION>Radcliffe</ORGANIZATION> to be released <DATE>today</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Zoo spokesman <PERSON>Jeff Jouett</PERSON> said <PERSON>Radcliffe</PERSON> was about to put the mole viper into a 
freezer in preparation for feeding it to a poisonous red-headed krait from 
<LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION> when he was bitten at <TIME>9:50 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. Kraits feed on other 
snakes, <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said, noting that the mole viper is one of 20 "feeder" snakes 
that had arrived in a shipment from a private dealer from out of state. 
</P>
<P>
"Our curator of snakes had never seen a mole viper in 29 years," <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said. 
"He had to get a magnifying glass and count the scales on its stomach to be 
able to make a positive identification. The 20 snakes, including the mole 
viper, were not identified as to species or whether or not they were venomous. 
In fact, the mole viper looks exactly like two or three other species of 
nonpoisonous snakes." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said <PERSON>Radcliffe</PERSON> was bitten on the index finger of his right hand, which 
began to "swell and hurt immediately after the bite." <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said the zoo keeps 
a well-stocked supply of anti-venom for most poisonous snakes, but has no such 
serum for the mole viper. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said the zoo was notified <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by officials at the 
<LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION> Zoo that one of their handlers was bitten by an African puff adder, 
necessitating a shipment of puff adder anti-venom from <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Mexico 
City</LOCATION>, via the <LOCATION>Tijuana</LOCATION> airport. He said <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> police rushed the anti-venom 
to <LOCATION>Tijuana</LOCATION> for the flight out. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said <PERSON>Radcliffe</PERSON>'s was the second bite a poisonous reptile had inflicted 
on a handler, the first occurring in <DATE>1984</DATE>, when a Gila monster bit two 
handlers. But it was the first time a venomous snake had bitten a handler.

<HEAD>When Viper Bit William Haast, The Viper Died</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The first time <PERSON>William Haast</PERSON> brought home
poisonous snakes, his horrified mother left home for three days. She
came back only because she realized her son's interest wasn't about
to slither away.
   At 78, <PERSON>Haast</PERSON> remains a self-described ``snake-aholic,'' who has
kept his energy and enthusiasm though he just weathered his 148th
snake bite. It is not surprising it was the viper, not <PERSON>Haast</PERSON>, who
passed on.
   Haast is founder and director of the <ORGANIZATION>Miami Serpentarium
Laboratories</ORGANIZATION>, which he started in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> in <DATE>1946</DATE>. He relocated the
lab to Salt <LOCATION>Lake City</LOCATION> five years ago to concentrate on venom
research and production.
   Haast claims to be the first to standardize snake venom and
produce it for research use. His clients include <ORGANIZATION>Wyeth Laboratories</ORGANIZATION>,
the only producer of antivenins in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>, and almost every
university in the country. He also has helped foster research into
the use of venom against such diseases as polio, multiple sclerosis
and AIDS.
   Haast was in his lab collecting venom from a Pakistani pit viper
<DATE>Feb. 28</DATE> when the serpent bit his left thumb. Not overly concerned,
he waited to see if the weekly venom injections he has given himself
for 40 years would provide immunity to the poison.
   When the bite was still bleeding after 24 hours, he took himself
to the hospital and was diagnosed in critical condition, the venom
robbing his blood of the ability to clot. Doctors said he could have
bled to death from a bump or fall.
   ``I guess I excited every hematologist (blood doctor) in town,''
he said. ``They dug up all the information they had on snake bites.''
   Haast, who was released from the hospital <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, praised the
extraordinary efforts in his behalf to obtain antivenins from
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and even from private sources
in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> aide helped contact foreign sources and ease
passage of the medicines through Customs.
   ``Those people involved in getting the antivenins are the heroes
of the story,'' he said. ``All I am is the result of an accident.''
Haast's condition started improving after he received the serum from
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, and doctors in the end opted not to use the foreign
serums.
   The night before <PERSON>Haast</PERSON> was bitten, he and <PERSON>Nancy Harrell</PERSON>, who
helps direct the lab, went to a local steak house for what she
called ``anything goes day.''
   Sometimes at the end of the month <LOCATION>Haast</LOCATION> abandons a strict routine
that includes eating animal protein only on even-numbered days and
never touching refined sugar. <TIME>This night</TIME>, he consumed four chocolate
sundaes.
   ``When I let myself go, I really let go,'' he said.
   The next day, <PERSON>Harrell</PERSON> said, <PERSON>Haast</PERSON> was a little hastier than usual
in his work. ``He was really buzzing around the lab that day,'' she
said.
   He believes his strict regimen _ which also includes always
walking up the 11 flights to his condominium _ helped him overcome
the viper's venom and to cleanse his system. It wasn't until nine
days after the bite that he ate solid food. Meantime, the snake had
died of natural causes.
   Haast, first bitten in <DATE>1926</DATE>, says his interest in snakes dates
back nearly 70 years to when he collected garter snakes out of
canals in <LOCATION>Paterson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>
   In <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Haast</LOCATION>'s serpentarium near the highway to the <LOCATION>Florida
Keys</LOCATION> was as much a tourist attraction as a laboratory. Visitors
could watch from a glass-enclosed amphitheater while <LOCATION>Haast</LOCATION> extracted
venom from hundreds of different species of snakes.
   He and <PERSON>Harrell</PERSON> moved the facility to <LOCATION>Salt Lake City</LOCATION> in <DATE>1984</DATE> to
focus more on research. He declines to say just how well the
business is faring except to say it's ``holding its own.''
   Haast collects venom from each snake about once a week, at the
same time they are fed a high-protein formula he mixes himself.
Harrell helps with the feedings; feeding and venom collection are
done at the same time to minimize trauma to the snakes.
   Nearly 50 years ago, <PERSON>Haast</PERSON> had a hunch that snake venom may be
valuable in treating polio and was proved right. Later, he had the
same feeling about multiple sclerosis and more recently has explored
the possibility of using venom in the fight against AIDS.
   Haast and <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> businessman <PERSON>Alan Glanville</PERSON> have organized AIDS
experimental treatment and research in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. Both hesitate to
discuss the project, saying it is in its infancy and the hospitals
and researchers involved require anonymity.
   Even after his latest brush with death, <PERSON>Haast</PERSON> says there is
little chance he will retire. In fact, he plans to start giving
himself booster shots to create an immunity to the species of viper
that bit him.

A PET SHOP WHERE THE SQUEAMISH GO FOR CURE

<TEXT>
<P>
It's a scene out of your worst nightmare. Thousands of snakes, lizards -- 
reptiles of all kinds -- crawling and writhing and slithering about in a space 
the size of a living room. It's enough to make <LOCATION>Indiana Jones</LOCATION>, or any 
ophidiophobe, go down for the count. 
</P>
<P>
There are albino Burmese pythons. And seven-foot green anacondas. And 
Colombian, Brazilian, and Argentine rainbow boas. There are tree boas, milk 
snakes, rat snakes, corn snakes, Carpet pythons and Baja rosey boas. Iguanas, 
monitors, skinks and chameleons are also scattered about. Any cold-blooded 
little crawly thing that your warm-blooded heart could desire. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION>'s Reptile Haven, <LOCATION>2205 E. Valley Parkway</LOCATION>, is one of only a handful of 
reptile "pet" stores in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. It specializes in more than 100 
species of snakes, tortoises, turtles, lizards and amphibians. At second glance 
(if you make it to second glance, that is), it is apparent that all of these 
beguiling beasts are safely behind glass or in aquariums -- save a 
less-than-frightening tortoise or two -- making it possible for visitors to 
browse the aisles and keep a comfortable distance while feigning bravery. 
</P>
<P>
It is just this discomfort and fear that brings many of Reptile Haven's patrons 
to its doors for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people come in to get over their phobia," says owner <PERSON>Chris Estep</PERSON>. "A 
couple of months ago two little old ladies came in. They were shaking at the 
door. They have 20 snakes now. They're really into it." 
</P>
<P>
Reptile Haven has gotten downright educational about this phobia. It has taken 
some of its specimens to psychology classes at <ORGANIZATION>Palomar College</ORGANIZATION> at which 
students overcome their fears by handling the animals. 
</P>
<P>
"We start out real slow," said <PERSON>Estep</PERSON>. "First, they look at (the reptiles) for a 
while, and then someone else holds (the reptiles) in front of them, and then 
they start at the tail and pet them, and, before you know it most of them are 
holding them and they feel good with them." 
</P>
<P>
Estep insists that, once people overcome their fear, reptiles can be wonderful 
pets. What, exactly, are some qualities that make snakes good pets? 
</P>
<P>
"They hold onto you and constrict around your arm," said <PERSON>Estep</PERSON>. "They're real 
slow moving, so they don't run away from you." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps some people find a constricting snake endearing. For those who wish it 
were a little faster-moving so it could run away from them, there are other 
options. Like iguanas or tortoises. 
</P>
<P>
"Tortoises are my No. 1 love," <PERSON>Estep</PERSON> said. "We have a huge breeding colony set 
up in <LOCATION>Lakeside</LOCATION> for super-rare tortoises. They're great." They're so great, in 
fact, that <PERSON>Estep</PERSON> is looking for another location to expand his enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a way of looking right into your eyes," he said. "They're really 
personable." 
</P>
<P>
"Tortoises definitely have a lot of character, and are really smart. They'll 
come out of their hiding places in the back yard to see what you're doing." 
Estep points out that tortoises eat mostly vegetation, and they're not 
aggressive when they eat. "They don't seem as bloodthirsty as snakes -- not so 
cold-blooded. They're really docile. Very few people have been hurt by them," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although <PERSON>Estep</PERSON> doesn't have any pet reptiles at home, he maintains they make 
better pets than cats or dogs. 
</P>
<P>
"They're low-maintenance pets," he said. "You can leave your pet snake for a 
month if you fill his water bowl before you leave, and, when you come back 
he'll be the same way, other than the droppings in the cage. You can't do that 
with a dog." 
</P>
<P>
This low maintenance was one of the draws for <PERSON>Estep</PERSON> to open Reptile Haven. When 
he opened the doors in <DATE>June, 1987</DATE>, <PERSON>Estep</PERSON> also owned A Bird Haven, a few doors 
down. 
</P>
<P>
"With the bird shop, I had to do a lot of work every day," he said. "Here, I 
can take off for three or four days, and, when I come back, other than it being 
a little messier, they're going to be alive." 
</P>
<P>
Reptiles' low susceptibility to virus and disease is another advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"The bird shop got wiped out three times. Everything in the whole shop died" 
because of a severe and fast-moving virus, <PERSON>Estep</PERSON> said. With snakes, however, 
viruses are rarely transmitted between species. 
</P>
<P>
As far as personality goes, however, reptiles fail miserably. "Snakes have the 
least personality," <PERSON>Estep</PERSON> said. "Most people have a snake for a year or so, 
then switch over to a lizard or a tortoise." 
</P>
<P>
Lizards are the most congenial of the lot. "If you raise an iguana from a baby, 
he'll follow you around the house and react to you more than a snake will," 
<PERSON>Estep</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Everything sold at <ORGANIZATION>Reptile Haven</ORGANIZATION> is legal to own. But the manner in which you 
handle and display your acquisition is a little tricky if you want to remain 
within the bounds of the law. Take the case of a 17-foot python. If a minor 
takes it out of its cage, it's illegal. If it is in your house, but out of its 
cage, it's illegal. And, the cage must have a padlock. 
</P>
<P>
"When people have pythons around their necks at the beach -- that's illegal," 
<PERSON>Estep</PERSON> said. "There's a ferocious beast law that covers it." 
</P>
<P>
Until last year, it was illegal in the city of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> to own any snake that 
reached over 4 feet. "They don't have that law anymore, because there are very 
few snakes that don't get over 4 feet," <PERSON>Estep</PERSON> said. "Even the king snakes get 4 
1/2 feet." 
</P>
<P>
Estep acknowledges the argument of environmentalists that snakes should be left 
in the wild, rather than kept in captivity. But he maintains that the trade in 
snakes as pets is less of a threat than other demands on the species. In <DATE>1988</DATE> 
over half a million Salvator monitor lizards were killed for the skin trade, he 
said, contrasted with the 1,300 sold in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> as pets. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Reptile Haven's snakes are bred in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
Some are imported from <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>. 
Reptile Haven exports some of its inventory, as well. This makes for a lot of 
paperwork, especially in the case of endangered species like the <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> 
tree boa, which sell for <MONEY>$5,000</MONEY> a pair. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to sell them out of state, you have to fill out forms with the 
<ORGANIZATION>Department of the Interior</ORGANIZATION> so they can OK the sale," <PERSON>Estep</PERSON> said. "Normally, I 
don't like to do that because the paper work is not worth it. If you sell in 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, all you have to do is give the people you sell to the same paper 
work you have. The government stuff takes about 40 days." 
</P>
<P>
And 40 days can make a big difference in shipping costs when you're dealing 
with live animals. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple years ago, we sold some stuff to <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Estep</PERSON> said. "When I 
bought the snakes, they were 6 pounds, and when we shipped them they were 20 
pounds."

<HEAD>Snake Blood Sold As Cure-all</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARI S. MANIAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BIDOR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's snake blood, not snake oil, but the
Bidor Snake Shop says it cures the same aches, arthritis, asthma,
acne and mysterious maladies of a sexual nature.
   The proprietor, <PERSON>Loi Chee Long</PERSON>, sells the blood of cobras and
other poisonous snakes to those who find his shop in this jungle
town 90 miles north of <LOCATION>Kuala Lumpur</LOCATION> and can pay the fee of up to
<MONEY>$120</MONEY>.
   Customers buy the snake, then Loi kills it and drains the blood,
mixing it with brandy for taste and wallop.
   Most of his customers are from <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>, but some
tourists drop in from <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> and there
is the occasional Western curiosity-seeker.
   ``The white man comes, but I think it is all too disgusting to
him,'' said <PERSON>Loi</PERSON>, 27. ``He inquires about the whole thing with great
enthusiasm, but when we ask him to have a drink he says `Not for
me, thanks.'''
   As he spoke, Loi had a firm grip on the neck of a cobra longer
than he was. Loi is about 5 ft. tall and the reptile's tail
thrashed the ground.
   The commotion continued while he explained calmly that people
drink snake blood because it can cure ``rheumatism, body aches and
skin diseases, improve the eyesight and increase your sexual
prowess, among other things.''
   He said a snake's venom is in its mouth and the blood contains
no poison.
   Loi explained the procedure like a surgeon conducting class:
   ``I hold the snake by the neck, find the main blood vessels on
the underside, slit them with a sharp knife and gather the blood in
the glass.
   ``Pieces of the snake's gallbladder are thrown in and an equal
amount of brandy is added. The brandy is to give the whole thing a
kick as you drink it. Beer and stout won't give that.
   ``This drinking cobra blood is nothing new. The Chinese have
been doing it for years.''
   With his free hand, he plucked a snake from another cage.
   ``Am I scared?'' he said. ``No. I have been catching snakes
since I left school at the age of 16.
   ``At first I used to creep quietly behind the snake, hold its
head with a stick and grab it by the neck and dump it into a cage.
Now I just grab it by the neck. After so many years, it would be
amateurish to use the stick.''
   He has never been bitten, <PERSON>Loi</PERSON> said, because he is a professional
snake catcher whose rule is: ``Your hand grabbing the neck has to
be quicker than the cobra's head to bite you.''
   Other professional catchers in Bidor include <PERSON>Wai Kwan Yang</PERSON>, his
partner in the shop, and Lim Ah Ha, who was listening to the
interview, <PERSON>Loi</PERSON> said.
   They take no antidote with them on hunting forays ``because the
doctor says it is illegal for us to carry such medicine around,''
he said, but ``we carry a small knife. If I am bitten I would cut
the area, drain the blood and rush to a doctor.
   ``We catch only poisonous snakes like the cobra, black cobra,
king cobra and pit vipers because only their blood will have the
proper effect.''
   About 30 to 50 people come to the shop for blood every month,
which <PERSON>Loi</PERSON> said was healthy traffic considering the price.
   ``To buy a cobra or some other poisonous snake ... would cost
between 100 and 300 ringgits (<MONEY>$40</MONEY> to <MONEY>$120</MONEY>), and that is a lot of
money considering that a long snake would only yield about six to
eight tablespoons of blood,'' he said. ``One snake is enough only
for one drink.''

<HEAD>Venom Researcher Bitten By Snake For 148th Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A researcher who maintains 1,000 venomous
snakes for scientific purposes was in serious but stable condition
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> after being bitten by a deadly <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> pit viper, his
148th snake bite.
   <PERSON>William E. Haast</PERSON>, 78, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Miami Serpentarium
Laboratories</ORGANIZATION>, was extracting venom from the viper <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> when it
bit his thumb, said <PERSON>John Dwan</PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>University of Utah
Health Sciences Center</ORGANIZATION>.
   Haast drove himself to the hospital, but doctors were not
immediately able to administer anti-venin because <PERSON>Haast</PERSON> was allergic
to the stock on hand. Another type was flown in from the <LOCATION>San Diego
Zoo</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Dwan</PERSON> said <PERSON>Haast</PERSON> told him it was the 148th time he'd been bitten
by a snake.
   The 40-year-old <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> Serpentarium originated the concept of
importing snakes from around the world to collect their venom. Its
customers include the <ORGANIZATION>National Institutes of Health</ORGANIZATION> and hundreds of
research and medical laboratories, which use the venom to
manufacture anti-venins.

<TEXT>
   Maybe there was something amiss in the hiss.
   Maybe it was viperous vibes.
   Whatever the serpentine signal he received, <PERSON>Tom Robertson Jr.</PERSON>
deemed things were not as they ssssssssseemed.
   <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON>, 36, a self-taught snake expert and former zoo
employee, walked into a pet store on <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Upper West
Side</LOCATION> about a week ago to buy some fish food.
   When he glanced at a tank that supposedly held harmless garter
snakes, he recognized similar-looking, Asian water snakes known as
Redneck Keelbacks. The snake's bite, in rare instances, can be
fatal.
   ``I told a guy in the store,'' said <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON>. ``He said he knew
they weren't poisonous. I told him I could bring them some proof;
he got real arrogant. I brought back a book, but they still didn't
believe me. ... I called the police, the <ORGANIZATION>ASPCA</ORGANIZATION>, Fish and <PERSON>Wildlife</PERSON> -
I called a lot of places, trying to find out what to do.''
   Finally, someone at the city <ORGANIZATION>Health Department</ORGANIZATION> took him
seriously.
   The department's inspectors called a <ORGANIZATION>New York University</ORGANIZATION>
biologist who confirmed <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON>'s suspicions.
   The inspectors learned that a wholesaler had sold <ORGANIZATION>Petland
Discount</ORGANIZATION> stores about 50 supposedly harmless snakes - and that some
had been distributed to the chain's 50 stores in the metropolitan
area.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Health Department</ORGANIZATION> issued a public warning about the snakes
<DATE>Friday</DATE> and is investigating the matter.
   ``They believe me now,'' said <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON>, who received
congratulations <DATE>Friday</DATE> from neighbors and relatives.
   Since <DATE>Friday</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>American Society</ORGANIZATION> for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals has picked up at least five snakes from pet owners who
called for help. Two were venomous. Two were not. It was unclear
whether the fifth one was.
   In addition, 14 venomous snakes were removed from stores and
taken to the zoo.
   Redneck Keelbacks are not usually aggressive. But a bite can be
fatal if untreated, <ORGANIZATION>Health Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Peter Lynn</PERSON> said.
   The orangy snakes are about 18 inches long and about as big
around ``as your pinky,'' Bronx Zoo spokeswoman <PERSON>Marilynn LeVine</PERSON>
said.
   <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON>, who's unemployed, has worked for pet store
wholesalers and for two years at a <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> zoo. He owns about 50
snake books.
   He says he's not scared of snakes, even though ``any time you
handle them, you have it in the back of your mind'' that they might
bite.
   Respect, he said, is the key.
   He's snakeless, right now. But he's owned more than 200 - king
snakes, albino rat snakes, boa constrictors, pythons - since he was
8 years old.
   Still, he concedes that they're not the cleverest of pets:
   ``You can't train them, or teach them tricks.''

   Lawrence, Kan. -- For some it would have been a nightmare
come true. The forest was crowded with trees and brush on a
day that hung heavy with dark, ominous clouds, suffocating
humidity and an eerie calm that's all but unheard of in a
state named after the southwind. Except for the occasional
soothing whistle of a bobwhite quail, the woods seemed void
of natural noises.
   Yet there were plenty of unnatural sounds being made by
the two men who preceded me along a rock-strewn ridgetop. The
ring of metal against stone and the clack of stone against
stone left no doubt of their determination as the pair used
small picks and gloved hands to lift and overturn tire-sized
rocks. Errol Hooper was the first to strike pay dirt. Happy
with his find, Mr. Hooper placed it in Joe Collins's waiting
hands -- a treasure of scales, wriggling tail and flicking
tongue.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Though the small, brown-striped lizard was gently resting
in a single hand, it was as though it was being held by two
different people. On the one hand, <PERSON>Mr. Collins</PERSON> spoke as a
nationally-respected zoologist when he said, "five-lined
skink, you can tell by the head that it's a female and she's
obviously carrying an abdomen full of eggs that are about
ready to be laid. She has a regenerated tail. You can tell by
the color that her original broke off."
   Yet the excited eagerness of his fingers and the gleam in
his eyes as <PERSON>Mr. Collins</PERSON> examined the five-inch reptile were
that of a boy who's deep into an activity that he dearly
loves.
   <PERSON>Mr. Collins</PERSON>'s affair with herpetology (the study of
reptiles and amphibians) is one that has spanned most of his
half-century of life. It began, he said, with the capture and
domestication of a queen snake from the <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> hardwoods. It
intensified quickly when he tried to learn more about
reptiles.
   "It was a really fun time when I was growing up, because
there really wasn't a lot known about these kinds of animals.
We were still in the discovery stage on a lot of things,"
said <PERSON>Mr. Collins</PERSON>, now a herpetologist and editor for the
<ORGANIZATION>Museum of Natural History</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Kansas</ORGANIZATION>. "Since
there was no real monetary use for reptiles, very little time
had been spent studying and writing about them. We spent a
lot of time with new and not yet discovered things. It wasn't
until <DATE>1958</DATE> that <PERSON>Roger Conant</PERSON> came out with the first handbook
for <PERSON>Peterson</PERSON> Field Guides."
   Yet it was still dozens of years before <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> began to
drop its "the only good snake is a dead snake" mentality.
Though keeping lizards and snakes for pets has long been
fashionable in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Collins</PERSON> credits <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s growing
environmental and natural awareness with a skyrocketing
interest in herpetology.
   "People are really figuring out that reptiles offer a
wealth of recreational value," said <PERSON>Mr. Collins</PERSON>. "We're not
up there with the bird people yet, but we're growing. We have
an increasing number of herpetological societies. Back in the
late '70s I estimated their memberships at 10,000. That's got
to be 50,000 now. . .and there are many, many more who don't
belong to an organization."
   Minutes after he'd released the skink, <PERSON>Mr. Hooper</PERSON> lifted a
western worm snake from its lair. With a coal-black back and
a vivid, carnation-pink belly, the docile snake's beauty
rivaled the plumage of a cock pheasant or a drake wood duck.
And you could touch it, too.
   Unlike most wildlife observation, herping can provide a
hands-on, as well as an eyes-on, experience. "When was the
last time you heard of someone holding and stroking a
cardinal or a sandhill crane. We've sure got that aspect over
birding," joked <PERSON>Mr. Collins</PERSON>. "You get a whole new
appreciation for living things when you can hold them and get
a feel for what they're like." And if you like them, you can
often take them home.
   "The concept of keeping reptiles is really catching on in
this country," said <PERSON>Mr. Collins</PERSON>. "In fact, some states are
really encouraging youngsters to get a lizard, snake or
salamander for a pet. Here in <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> you can keep up to five
of any one species as long as it's not on the threatened and
endangered list. Some reptiles really adapt well to
{captivity}. That's something that's simply not true with
wild mammals and birds."
   Unquestionably the best introduction to all this is a
field guide that <PERSON>Mr. Collins</PERSON> recently co-authored with a
friend he calls "the grand old man of herpetology"<PERSON>Roger
Conant</PERSON>. "Reptiles and Amphibians Eastern/Central <LOCATION>North
America</LOCATION>" (<ORGANIZATION>Houghton Mifflin Co.</ORGANIZATION>, 450 pages, <MONEY>$17.95</MONEY>) gives a
detailed description of 595 species and subspecies. The book,
part of the prestigious <ORGANIZATION>Peterson Field Guide</ORGANIZATION> series, contains
more than a thousand full-color plate illustrations and
drawings, and more than 300 detailed distribution maps.
   Just as importantly, this definitive guide offers solid
information on the tools and techniques for searching for,
handling and keeping reptiles and amphibians. There's also a
chapter on poisonous snakebites, an aspect of the field that
<PERSON>Mr. Collins</PERSON> claims adds spice to the life of a herpetologist:
"There's always been a mystique around animals that can hurt
you -- grizzly bears, mountain lions, gray wolves. .
.rattlesnakes. The danger of dying from a snakebite is
greatly exaggerated, but it can keep things interesting."
   Our herping trip got "interesting" when we left the rocky
ridge <PERSON>Mr. Collins</PERSON> nicknamed "hernia heaven" and headed for
the car. <PERSON>Mr. Hooper</PERSON> spotted a yard -- plus timber rattlesnake
stretched beside a wood rat nest. He closed to within a few
feet of the snake and watched as it lazily crawled beneath a
table-sized slab of limestone near where we stood. When its
dangerous head was well under the rock, <PERSON>Mr. Collins</PERSON> stomped
the ground to draw the rattle. The sound brought a grin to
his face that lasted for hours.
   "I've seen lots of them but there's always something
special about seeing a timber rattler," <PERSON>Mr. Collins</PERSON> later
said. "It can make a good morning even more memorable. That's
the kind of experience that we dream about."

When a 4-foot rattlesnake slithered into <PERSON>Holly Lenz</PERSON>'s home <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, 
apparently headed for her 2-year-old son's bedroom, it was Lucy the adopted cat 
that sounded the alarm. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Lenz</PERSON> was outside in the sun, reading a book, when Lucy began hissing loudly. 
Lenz rushed inside and found the snake in a hallway, face to face with the cat, 
apparently trying to escape to the boy's bedroom. As <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> kept the snake 
cornered, <PERSON>Lenz</PERSON> called police, who in turn alerted animal control authorities. 
</P>
<P>
When the ordeal was over the snake was dead, <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> was being examined at an 
animal clinic and all the humans -- <PERSON>Adam</PERSON> the toddler, three police officers and 
an animal control worker -- were safe. 
</P>
<P>
"These three large, burly policemen stood well away and this little tiny woman 
from animal control went right in," <PERSON>Lenz</PERSON> said. "This little woman was fearless. 
She went right at it with one of those poles with a noose on it and got him by 
the head. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they pay these people enough." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Lenz</PERSON>, 36, said the snake thrashed around when it was captured. Once it was 
taken outside, she said, a sheriff's deputy clubbed it with a shovel, chopping 
off its head. 
</P>
<P>
"Where are you going to relocate a 4-foot rattlesnake?" <PERSON>Lenz</PERSON> said. "I mean it's 
sad but what were they going to do with him? So they buried the head in my back 
yard because it is poisonous for 24 hours, and they took the body away." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Ronald Wheeler</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Orange County Animal Control</ORGANIZATION> office said snakes are 
commonly seen this time of year in the coastal desert areas such as <LOCATION>Laguna 
Niguel</LOCATION>, as well 
</P>
<P>
as in other areas of the county. 
</P>
<P>
The reptiles usually don't move into people's homes, <PERSON>Wheeler</PERSON> said, but they are 
more active during <DATE>spring</DATE> and <DATE>summer</DATE> when temperatures are warmer, often 
entering lawns and sunning themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Rattlesnakes usually strike only when they have been approached and challenged, 
<PERSON>Wheeler</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"Typically, the people who get bit are those who are surprised by the snake." 
</P>
<P>
As for <PERSON>Lenz</PERSON>, she said she won't keep the sliding glass door to her bedroom open 
any more and will be more aware of the wildlife that abounds in <LOCATION>South County</LOCATION>. 
She said Lucy the cat, while fearless with the snake, needs a few lessons on 
dealing with people. 
</P>
<P>
"The minute the police showed up, my cat went under the bed," <PERSON>Lenz</PERSON> said. "She's 
not afraid of the rattlesnake but she's afraid of other people."

<TEXT>
   Not all the animals running loose in <LOCATION>New York
City</LOCATION> are dogs, cats or freewheeling cab drivers. It IS a jungle out
there.
   ``I don't expect to see a zebra, but then again this is <LOCATION>Fun City</LOCATION>
so you'll never know,'' said <PERSON>George S. Watford</PERSON>, head of rescue
services for the <ORGANIZATION>American Society</ORGANIZATION> for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals.
   In 28 years with the humane society, <ORGANIZATION>Watford</ORGANIZATION> has seen
alligators, baboons, bears, barn owls, caimans, chimpanzees and
eagles. Foxes, horses, lambs, lions, mandrills and monitor lizards.
Parrots, peregrine falcons, pigs, raccoons, sea turtles and sheep.
Swans, tarantulas and tigers.
   They all make their way to special <ORGANIZATION>ASPCA</ORGANIZATION> preserves such as the
room marked ``EXOTIC ANIMALS'' at the <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> shelter. There, in
the din of baying dogs and mewling cats, one can occasionally hear
a hiss, screech or roar more common to the wilds of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> or
deepest <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>.
   Last year, officials say, the organization captured 5,304 exotic
animals _ a category that includes everything but dogs and cats.
But it takes something special to turn the head of an <ORGANIZATION>ASPCA</ORGANIZATION> veteran.
   ``People consider bats exotic,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Watford</ORGANIZATION>. ``We don't. We
get a lot of them flying through <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>.''
   The <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> shelter had three quail in its exotic ward one
recent day; they had been seized from a pet store because selling
the birds is illegal. Two weeks earlier, the <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> shelter
confiscated a ram from a Moslem family planning to slaughter it for
a feast.
   In <DATE>December</DATE>, a South American cargo ship 400 miles offshore
radioed that an osprey had crash-landed on its deck. Once the
vessel was in the harbor, a shelter worker was dispatched in a
motor launch to retrieve the fish-eating hawk, now on the
endangered species list.
   In the Greatest Hits category, nothing tops the Burmese python
that police discovered protecting a <LOCATION>Queens</LOCATION> drug dealer's apartment.
   ``I've never seen anything that large, anything that weighed
more than me in the snake area. And I weigh 200 pounds,'' said
<ORGANIZATION>Watford</ORGANIZATION>. The python was estimated to weigh 300 to 350 pounds. It
measured 16 feet long and at least 30 inches around at the head. In
the exotic animal room, the snake stood straight up on its tail and
sniffed the ceiling.
   Police told <ORGANIZATION>Watford</ORGANIZATION> the diet of the ``guard snake'' had been
full-grown rabbits, six at a time.
   ``If it got around your neck, God knows what would happen,'' he
said. ``It was certainly capable of swallowing a 12-year-old kid
whole.''
   Watford does not always know how the animals come to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
``How does a sea turtle end up in a bathroom in upper <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>?''
he said with a shrug. But he does know how they come to the
attention of the <ORGANIZATION>ASPCA</ORGANIZATION>.
   They run amok.
   Take snakes. ``(Owners) wake up one morning and it's not where
it's supposed to be. It's not in the glass aquarium. Maybe the
neighbor finds it in her bathtub. Or under her bed. Or in her bed.
That creates the kind of environment that is quite frightening.''
   Sometimes, the animals are involved in crimes. <PERSON>Richard A. Orzo</PERSON>,
a 32-year veteran of the rescue service, remembers a monkey trained
to perform specialized burglaries. The owner would cut circular
holes in the windows of <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> liquor stores and send the monkey
in for cocktails.
   Sometimes, the animals kill. Two years ago, a <LOCATION>Queens</LOCATION> woman was
found dead in her home near aquariums full of venom-spitting cobras.
   ``They're fascinating. They're beautiful,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Watford</ORGANIZATION>.
``People fall in love with snakes, even the most venomous type. ..
. Just a nick and it could kill you.''
   Often, it is not humans but the animals who are imperiled.
Scores of barnyard animals have been confiscated before they could
be sacrificed in religious ceremonies.
   ``We take a dim view of the killing of any animal,'' said
<ORGANIZATION>Watford</ORGANIZATION>.
   Once captured, the animals are given to zoos, sent to animal
farms or, when possible, released into the wild. They are not
returned to their owners; keeping exotic animals is against <LOCATION>New
York City</LOCATION> health codes.
   The owners, who sometimes have invested thousands of dollars, do
not always relinquish the beasts gracefully.
   Police took custody of an ocelot after the forest cat ripped
open both arms of its mistress, a <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> woman. Her arms were placed
in casts, and her cat was placed with the <ORGANIZATION>ASPCA</ORGANIZATION>.
   When she came to visit, shelter workers left her briefly alone
with her pet and she was next seen trying to spirit the ocelot out
the door, cradling it in her casts.

<HEAD>Python that Slithered Down Toilet Last Month Found In Yard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A seven-foot Burmese python that
slithered to freedom through a pet store toilet has been found
after a month on the loose, somewhat skinnier but no worse for
wear.
   The snake turned up in a yard <DATE>last week</DATE> about a mile from <LOCATION>Wet
Pets</LOCATION>, where owner <PERSON>Brent Loewer</PERSON> had been keeping it in hopes of
selling the snake for its owner.
   ``He was kind of thin. He hadn't eaten in a while,'' said Lower.
   <PERSON>Loewer</PERSON> said he normally keeps the snake in a small cage, but
sometimes lets it loose in the store restroom for exercise. About a
month ago, he forgot one detail when he let the snake out for its
exercise slither: ``He loves water and I left the toilet open.''
   When he returned, the snake was long gone. Every few days, he
said, city employees checked a manhole outside the store, but
didn't find the snake in the sewer.
   He said he'd given up hope of ever finding the snake when a
woman walked into the store and asked what a big snake would eat.
   It turned out that the snake came out of hiding when a neighbor
began mowing his lawn <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. Apparently afraid of the noise, the
snake headed up a tree in his yard.
   <PERSON>Loewer</PERSON> said the neighbor ran to his garage and grabbed a
hatchet, but the woman's husband stopped him from killing it, got
the snake out of the tree and sent his wife to the store to find
out what to feed it.
   When she described the snake, he said, he realized it could be
the python. He showed the couple photographs of the snake that had
been taken by its owner, and the couple returned the snake.
   <PERSON>Loewer</PERSON> said the snake is about 2 years old and isn't fully
grown.

   Eight snakes snatched from their zoo cages were
returned unharmed in cloth sacks, but the reptile rustlers who kept
them over the weekend slid into hiding, police said.
   Juveniles were apparently keeping the two boa constrictors and
six pythons from the <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> Zoo at a house in a <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> suburb,
authorities said. But before police could follow up on a tip, the
snakenappers left the dwelling.
   <PERSON>Jim Murphy</PERSON>, a curator, said he was at the zoo <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>
when a father and son came into the office and said the boy had
something he wanted to return. The snakes, worth an estimated
<MONEY>$8,000</MONEY>, were in cloth sacks, he said.
   No arrests have been made in the case.
   ``We're just relieved they're back,'' said <PERSON>Murphy</PERSON>, referring to
the six pythons and two boas.
   Zoo director <PERSON>Warren Iliff</PERSON> said the snakes were taken from their
cages in a work area at the zoo between <TIME>5 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE> and <TIME>11 a.m.</TIME>
<DATE>Saturday</DATE>. Workers found no signs of forced entry, and lids still
covered the snakes' cages, some of which were found latched.
   ``I don't know how they could have gotten them,'' <PERSON>Iliff</PERSON> said.
``We have to make sure it doesn't happen again.''
   <PERSON>Iliff</PERSON> said none of the snakes is poisonous, but whoever took
them would have needed some knowledge of reptiles to pull off the
heist.
   The snakes did not appear to have been abused or neglected,
<PERSON>Iliff</PERSON> and <PERSON>Murphy</PERSON> said.
   The theft of the boas especially worried zoo officials, said
spokeswoman <PERSON>Victoria Furber</PERSON>. The two snakes came from <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>
and are listed as an endangered species because their forest
habitat is being destroyed.

<HL> David Shepherd Sure Knows How
To Take the Fun Out of Driving
---
By Andrea Rothman
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL>
<DD> 02/17/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   You're driving on a <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> road and spy a snake ahead. 
There's nothing you would rather do than squish the slithering reptile under your wheels. 
But first, remember: <PERSON>David Shepherd</PERSON> may be watching you. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Shepherd</PERSON>, a 46-year-old biology professor at <ORGANIZATION>Southeastern Louisiana University</ORGANIZATION>, is a fan of reptiles who has related interests in American driving habits. 
To test the effect of the latter on the former, he conducted an experiment -- and saw some pretty gruesome stuff. 

   At a local toy store he bought a two-foot-long rubber snake. 
Then he and some of his students trekked out to a fairly untraveled highway, put the snake in the road, hid in the woods and waited. 
The object: To see how many drivers ran over it. 
Sometimes a plastic turtle was used instead, to see which animal fared worse. 

   The snake fared worse. 

   The professor's results, which he recently announced to the <ORGANIZATION>Louisiana Academy of Science</ORGANIZATION>, showed that of 12,400 encounters between snake and auto over a period of three years, 1,281, or <PERCENT>10.3%</PERCENT>, ended in "death" for the snake. 
Of the 9,600 encounters between turtle and auto, only about <PERCENT>5%</PERCENT> ended in the turtle's "death." 

   Moreover, of the 1,281 snake "deaths," 498 resulted from drivers deliberately going out of their way to make a hit. 

   "Lots of times (cars) would turn around and run back over the snake," says <PERSON>Mr. Shepherd</PERSON>. 
"The most was five times." 
And some people stopped, put their wheel on the creature, and "rolled back and forth." 
The students saw others drive up on the road's shoulder. 
Once a sheriff even jumped out of the car and pulled a gun -- but the group came out of hiding to explain. 

   It wasn't all bad. 
One woman stopped to help the snake off the road. 
When she heard a car coming, "she ran down the road, waving her arms, not wanting the (car) to hit him," says <PERSON>Mr. Shepherd</PERSON>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Shepherd</PERSON> says the experiment was inspired by a disturbing memory from his student days. 
He had seen a huge truck swing into the opposite lane of a highway, specifically to hit a snake. 
After reading articles on animals killed on highways, he wondered, "How many are intentional?" 

   The professor, whom some locals now call "The Snake Man," says he's just lucky his interest is in reptiles. 
"If I'd been interested in deer," he says, "I couldn't have really done this."

<HEAD>Doctors Awaiting Serum From Iran To Treat Snakebite Victim</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURIE SULLIVAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Physicians treating a snake-venom
researcher, whose need for rare medicine prompted <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>
intervention, were awaiting a shipment of serum from <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> today to
counteract a deadly viper bite.
   In an unusual effort initiated by <PERSON>Stephen Studdert</PERSON>, special
assistant to President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, antivenins effective against the bite
of a Pakistani pit viper were located in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and the
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Customs rules were waived to place the
shipments quickly on flights to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   The antivenins were sought for <PERSON>William E. Haast</PERSON>, 78, who was in
serious but stable condition at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Utah Health
Sciences Center</ORGANIZATION> today after being bitten in the left hand by the
viper earlier in the week.
   The British shipment from the <ORGANIZATION>English National Poison Unit</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> arrived <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. But doctors did not administer it to
<LOCATION>Haast</LOCATION>, deciding instead to wait for the more effective Iranian
serum, said nursing supervisor <PERSON>Rick Taylor</PERSON>.
   ``The one from <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION> is the best one, I understand, because of
its properties,'' <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> said. ``We will not give the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> one
unless <PERSON>Mr. Haast</PERSON>'s condition deteriorates.''
   Haast was being given plasma intermittently to replace
coagulating elements of his blood. The snake's venom prohibits blood
from coagulating and victims often bleed to death.
   Haast, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Miami Serpentarium Laboratories</ORGANIZATION> at the
university's <ORGANIZATION>Research Park</ORGANIZATION>, has been bitten 148 times by snakes and
is immune to the venom of dozens of reptiles. But he had no immunity
to withstand the viper's bite and checked himself into the hospital
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   The Pakistani pit viper, or saw-scaled viper, is one of 1,000
exotic, poisonous snakes <LOCATION>Haast</LOCATION> keeps at the lab, where their venom
is extracted for sale to universities and health organizations for
use in research and the manufacture of antivenins.
   Haast had been treated earlier with antivenins from <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s
<LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION>, including one shipment obtained through an unusual
airport relay involving zoo personnel, a helicopter and a departing
jetliner.
   Studdert of Salt <LOCATION>Lake City</LOCATION> said he became involved <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>
when he received a call from an associate of <ORGANIZATION>Haast's</ORGANIZATION>. The associate,
who had read accounts of a speech <PERSON>Studdert</PERSON> gave in <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> describing
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s ``kinder, gentler'' approach to human problems, said the
serum could only be located in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and asked
for the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration's help.
   <PERSON>Studdert</PERSON> said he immediately set up conference calls with people
around the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and in other countries after doctors and
specialists advised the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> that the serums Haast needed
were unavailable in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   Using an American interpreter who speaks <LOCATION>Farsi</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Studdert</PERSON> put
<LOCATION>Haast</LOCATION>'s representatives in telephone contact with serum specialists
in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>.
   Two different serums were needed, he said, one for young pit
vipers and another for older snakes of the same breed.
   Vials of the Iranian serum were due to arrive in <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> <TIME>this
afternoon</TIME>.
   The serum found at the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> institute was the antivenin used
for younger vipers.
   Another supply of the serum was obtained through the <ORGANIZATION>Tashkent
Institute of Vaccines</ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>. That serum was being
flown to <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> for eventual shipment to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   ``When I decided I should get involved, I clearly did not want to
disturb the president,'' <PERSON>Studdert</PERSON> said. ``But I decided, this is
what the president would have wanted us to do.''

   A herpetologist bitten by a deadly viper a
week ago was released from the <ORGANIZATION>University of Utah Health Sciences
Center</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, but will be closely monitored, a spokesman said.
   <PERSON>William Haast</PERSON>, 78, has been bitten by snakes 148 times during his
career as a venom researcher. He has built up immunity to the venom
of dozens of snakes, but became ill after being bitten on the hand
<DATE>Feb. 28</DATE> by a Pakistani pit viper.
   After treatment with antivenin flown in from the <LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION>
was less effective than expected, a worldwide effort was launched,
with the help of the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration, to obtain more antivenin.
   Serums came from <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, but were not
used because doctors feared possible side effects and because <LOCATION>Haast</LOCATION>
appeared finally to be recovering.
   ``He will contintue to be treated and seen by physicians on an
out-patient basis,'' hospital spokesman <PERSON>John Dwan</PERSON> said.
   Haast is director of the <ORGANIZATION>Miami Serpentarium Laboratories</ORGANIZATION> at the
university's nearby research park. He keeps an estimated 1,000
poisonous snakes at the lab, where venom is extracted for research
and the manufacture of antivenins.

   <PERSON>Mike Larimer</PERSON>, whose house is full of snakes
and other unusual pets, is the first to admit he doesn't view the
slithery serpents the way most folks do.
   ``There's a lot of people who just don't understand snakes,''
<PERSON>Larimer</PERSON> said. ``It really bothers me. They do a lot of good. They
kill a lot of rats and spiders and keep the rabbit population under
control, too.''
   He has plenty of chances to see snakes up close at home. Some
stay coiled up in tanks and cages. Sheba, a 50-pound python, has her
own room.
   ``Sheba's a little too big for a cage,'' <PERSON>Larimer</PERSON> said during a
recent interview at his home.
   Larimer's 10-foot prize pet could grow three times as long if she
eats enough of the live rabbits he keeps around for snake food.
   ``I'm really proud of her,'' <PERSON>Larimer</PERSON> said.
   In addition to the snakes, <PERSON>Larimer</PERSON> has a neon-green iguana named
<PERSON>Charlie</PERSON>, a tarantula dubbed Octy II, a pair of piranhas and some
frogs.
   ``Everything I've got but <PERSON>Charlie</PERSON> and my python came from the
woods,'' he said. ``Why buy it from the pet store when you can get
it for free? It's a lot more fun that way, too.''
   Larimer likes other animals, but says there's something special
about a scaly pet that slithers and hisses instead of barking all
night.
   ``Once you get over your fear of them, they make just as good a
pet as a cat or a dog,'' he said. ``They're a lot more interesting
to watch. They make nifty knots.''

   ``The doctors are evaluating it,'' said <PERSON>John Dwan</PERSON>, hospital
spokesman. ``We're hopeful that it's not needed, but that remains to
be seen.''
   In an unusual effort initiated by <PERSON>Stephen Studdert</PERSON>, special
assistant to President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, antivenins effective against the bite
were located in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Customs
rules were waived to place the shipments quickly on flights to the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   The British shipment from the <ORGANIZATION>English National Poison Unit</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> arrived <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. But doctors did not administer it to
<LOCATION>Haast</LOCATION>, deciding instead to wait for the more effective Iranian
serum, said nursing supervisor <PERSON>Rick Taylor</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Studdert</PERSON> said the shipment from the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> was being
arranged through direct, government-to-government contacts, but in
<LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>, ``people-to-people, non-government'' contacts were used. There
are no formal ties between the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s
fundamentalist Moslem government, which has repeatedly referred to
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> as the ``Great Satan.''
   Meanwhile, <PERSON>Haast</PERSON>'s fibrinogen level, an element in the blood that
regulates how the blood coagulates and is destroyed by the snake
bite venom, has been improving, although it remained far below
acceptable levels, according to hospital spokesman <PERSON>John Dwan</PERSON>.
   ``We have been replacing fibrinogen through transfusions and his
body appears to be making fibrinogen,'' <PERSON>Dwan</PERSON> said.
   The Iranian antivenin arrived at mid-afternoon and one of <LOCATION>Haast</LOCATION>'s
friends transported it to the hospital. Before it is used, <PERSON>Dwan</PERSON> said
doctors would monitor <PERSON>Haast</PERSON>'s condition and run checks on the
antivenin.
   ``These antivenins are not miracle cure-alls,'' he said. ``There
are negative side effects that we have to guard against.'' He said
antivenins, which are made from horse serum, can cause lung and
kidney problems.
   Haast had been treated earlier with antivenins from <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s
<LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION> and from a lab in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, but <PERSON>Dwan</PERSON> said he had
not been given antivenins for about 24 hours.
   The supply of the serum from the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> was being sent from
the <ORGANIZATION>Tashkent Institute of Vaccines</ORGANIZATION>. That serum was being flown to
<LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> and was expected to get to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> late <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   Haast, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Miami Serpentarium Laboratories</ORGANIZATION> at the
university's <ORGANIZATION>Research Park</ORGANIZATION>, has been bitten 148 times by snakes and
is immune to the venom of dozens of reptiles. But he had no immunity
to withstand the viper's bite and checked himself into the hospital
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> after being bitten <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   The Pakistani pit viper, or saw-scaled viper, is one of 1,000
exotic, poisonous snakes <LOCATION>Haast</LOCATION> keeps at the lab, where their venom
is extracted for sale to universities and health organizations for
use in research and the manufacture of antivenins.

AMERICAN ALBUM: HOLIDAY CAROLERS SING A TUNE TO THE TURTLEDOVES;

ZOO VOLUNTEERS BEGAN THE TRADITION 14 YEARS AGO. THIS YEAR 7,000 PEOPLE 
SERENADED THE ANIMALS.

Dr. <PERSON>Dolittle</PERSON> would have been proud. 
</P>
<P>
"Deck the hall with boughs of holly," sang 9-year-old <PERSON>Christopher Jett</PERSON>, huddled 
around the sea lion pool at the Lincoln Park Zoo the other day. "Fa la la la 
la, la la la la." 
</P>
<P>
It's a precious Christmas image: Cherub-faced youngsters strolling down 
snow-covered streets, serenading families that flock to their doorsteps bearing 
warm cider and cookies. Try that in most big cities today and you're liable to 
get mugged or chased down the block by the neighborhood watch. 
</P>
<P>
Here in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, however, the great yuletide custom lives on, albeit with a 
twist. Carolers don't sing to people anymore. They sing to animals. 
</P>
<P>
Every year, a few Sundays before <DATE>Christmas</DATE>, throngs of Chicagoans gather to 
warble a message of Peace on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Good Will Toward Mammals</ORGANIZATION> to the lions, 
gazelles, elephants, giraffes, hedgehogs, armadillos, iguanas, turtles, 
turtledoves, partridges and all the other species on display at the 35-acre 
urban animal park just north of <LOCATION>The Loop</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not supposed to anthropomorphize, but I think they love it," insisted 
<PERSON>Carol Leifer</PERSON>, a zoo spokesperson. " . . . I have seen spectacled bears swaying 
to the music." 
</P>
<P>
Little <PERSON>Christopher</PERSON> had no idea that "anthropomorphize" meant to attribute human 
characteristics to animals. He just knew that singing to animals in a cage was 
a lot more fun than doing it at home. "I tried singing to my cat but he 
scratched me," <PERSON>Christopher</PERSON> explained. 
</P>
<P>
Caroling to the animals began here 14 years ago when a handful of volunteer zoo 
workers did it on a lark. Over the years, the popularity has mushroomed to the 
point where it has probably become the city's most widely attended Christmas 
event. More than 7,000 people took part this year. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with tradition, everyone assembled first around the outdoor sea lion 
pool where <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION>, sometimes known as <PERSON>Ron Solomon</PERSON> (remember, it's a tradition 
with a twist), arrived toting his satchel full of mackerel and herring. He 
tossed the fish into the pool, where Junior, the 800-pound major-domo of the 
water, and the rest of his pals merrily munched away to the strains of "O Come 
All Ye Faithful." 
</P>
<P>
From there, the choristers broke up according to animal preference. Some headed 
over to the lion house, some to the children's zoo, some to the large mammal 
area, and, yes, some to the reptile exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't stand snakes," admitted <PERSON>Eryl Morgan</PERSON>, nervously turning her back to a 
reticulated python as she belted out a verse of "Jolly Old St. Nicholas." "But 
I can't see any of them with all these people in here. Besides, I'm not really 
singing to them. I'm singing to a plate of glass." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan might not have been crooning to the snakes, but the snakes might have 
been thinking otherwise. <PERSON>Clarence Wright</PERSON>, the curator of the reptile house, 
said snakes have ultra sensitive lower jaws and scales and probably pick up 
vibrations from the music. 
</P>
<P>
"It really doesn't bother them, but they're just aware of it more (than normal 
crowd noise)," he explained. "They're probably moving around a lot more." 
</P>
<P>
Experts are unsure how much other animals appreciate the musical interlude. "It 
certainly doesn't distress them," said <PERSON>Steve Thompson</PERSON>, the zoo's director of 
conservation of science. "Either they see it as 'just those silly humans again' 
or they may actually enjoy it. It's hard to tell." 
</P>
<P>
Some carolers swear that when they start singing en masse, lions roar back, sea 
lions bark and even snakes flick their tongues in time to the music. 
</P>
<P>
While the motivation behind such actions is open to debate, senior lion keeper 
Art <PERSON>Maraldi</PERSON> said he has noticed that big cats seem to enjoy classical music and 
jazz. Once, he said, the lions started "roaring like crazy" when a brass 
ensemble played outside their cages. 
</P>
<P>
As for Christmas carols, <PERSON>Maraldi</PERSON> said the cats could probably take them or 
leave them. When the singing began, leopards, jaguars and other cats did begin 
pacing back and forth anxiously. But <PERSON>Maraldi</PERSON> said such nervous behavior 
probably had less to do with the sound than the sight of hundreds of sumptuous 
looking youngsters massed tantalizingly just a few feet away. 
</P>
<P>
"They react to the little size of the children," he explained. "The children 
are just the right size to eat."

<LEADPARA>  'WHEN I die, I wanna snake-bit die.";    Dewey Chafin's voice is soft as
gauze, but the sentiment is hammered iron. You can't doubt a man's sincerity
when he's standing at a pulpit in shirt sleeves holding two fistfuls of
squirming rattlesnake.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  SERPENTS DON'T RATTLE SNAKE-HANDLING FAITHFUL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "Yes, Lord," answers a parishioner.;    "Praise JEEsus," howls another.;   
This is the Church of the Lord Jesus in the last state in the union where
religious snake-handling is legal. The church isn't affiliated with any
official Christian denomination. It has no religious statuary, no baptismal
fountain, not even a cross. Which is not to suggest it has no religion.;   
"I'm a snake-handler," says <PERSON>Chafin</PERSON>. His mother beams. She's here too, and
she's holding a hissing rattler of her own.;    <PERSON>Chafin</PERSON> is 58, a disabled coal
miner and a Korean War vet, and like the five dozen people standing hip to
buttock in this makeshift rural church, he believes in the <LOCATION>New Testament</LOCATION>
exactly as it was written. And that includes the Book of Mark, Chapter 16,
Verse 18, where Jesus says, "They shall take up serpents; and if they drink
any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick,
and they shall recover.";    And so it is that each dance with snakes is a
test of faith.;    In 35 years of snake-handling, <PERSON>Chafin</PERSON> says, he's been
bitten 116 times. He's been fanged on the hands, the arms, and not long ago a
five-foot diamondback took him through the right eyebrow.;    Like all
snake-handlers, <PERSON>Chafin</PERSON> says he's never treated a bite with anything other than
prayer.;    Around him are some 50 members of his church. Not one of them
drinks, not one of them smokes, and all of them dress like ladies and gents.
The rules in this church are posted high for anyone to see. Neatness is
required. "Lying" is outlawed, along with "gossiping" and "backbiting.";   
Here is <PERSON>Lydia Hollins</PERSON>, the organist. She is <ORGANIZATION>Dewey</ORGANIZATION>'s niece, a handsome woman of
38.;    <PERSON>Hollins</PERSON> is the daughter of <PERSON>Columbia Chafin</PERSON>, who died in <DATE>1962</DATE>, when
<PERSON>Lydia</PERSON> was just a girl. She snake-bit died, at the age of 22. To this day, she
remains the Church of the <ORGANIZATION>Lord Jesus</ORGANIZATION>'s only fatality, <PERSON>Dewey Chafin</PERSON> says. She
was his sister.;    And now the dead woman's daughter is gently cradling a
big- bellied viper in both hands, and praising the <LOCATION>Lord.</LOCATION>;    There is
fanaticism in this room, and there is bravery and passion and something
strangely moving that is not easily put into words.;    Snake-handlers have
been practicing their religion throughout <LOCATION>Appalachia</LOCATION> and in the hills and
hollows of <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> since the <DATE>turn of the century</DATE>. It's still going on in
all of those places, most always in defiance of one law or another. Not here.;
   According to <PERSON>Kenneth Ambrose</PERSON>, a sociologist at <ORGANIZATION>Marshall University</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Huntington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>W. Va.</LOCATION>, who has studied snake- handling, politicians in the state
of <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> have learned that it's useless to try to legislate against
something that folks want to do, just because it's for their own good.;   
Even when untreated, bites from <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>'s venomous snakes seldom kill
healthy adults, but they sometimes do. On the average, snakebites kill 13
Americans a year, but since <DATE>1909</DATE>, only a dozen or so of those deaths have been
traced to religious ceremonies.;    Snake-handlers believe they survive
through the power of their prayer, and they'll brook no argument on that
point.;    As an impromptu rendition of "Reach Out and Touch the Lord" blasts
through the room, the children are separated in the back of the room. The
adults are on their feet and moving. Everyone is dancing -- a free-style,
spirited, rolling shuffle- stomp. Most everyone is singing.;    Snakes are
passed from hand to hand, man to woman, woman to man, man to man, gingerly,
reverently.;    When the music stops after maybe a quarter hour of snake-
handling, the men and women almost reluctantly place the animals back in the
boxes.;    "A lot of people call us a lot of names because of the way we
choose to worship the Lord. They think we're not all there because we handle
snakes," <ORGANIZATION>Pastor Bob Elkins</ORGANIZATION> says at a microphone. "We don't try to push our
religion on anybody.";    "Yes, Jesus.";    "They say when we get bit we're
just tempting the Lord. Well, it says right in the <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION> that the Lord can't
be tempted. It's in the Book of James.";    "Amen, Jesus.";    Then <ORGANIZATION>Elkins</ORGANIZATION>
announces: "Remember, if you're under 18, stay out of the boxes."  </TEXT>

SINGAPORE OFFICIALS FEAR POPULATION PLUNGE IN CHINESE ZODIAC'S YEAR OF THE 
SNAKE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
With the Year of the Snake approaching with the lunar new year, officials 
worried about a population plunge are emphasizing that many of history's finest 
were born under the sign of the slithery reptile. 
</P>
<P>
"Snakes make great people," pleads Health Minister <PERSON>Yeo Cheow Tong</PERSON> to Chinese 
couples reluctant to start a family in a less than auspicious astrological 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals that brimmed over with babies during the outgoing <ORGANIZATION>Dragon</ORGANIZATION> year -- with 
its portents of wealth and prosperity -- are preparing for empty beds in Snake 
year. Stores are stocking less maternity and infant clothing. 
</P>
<P>
For 1,000 years Chinese astrology has revolved around 12 mythical or real 
animals, each conveying personality and character traits to those born within 
its 12-month cycle. Depending upon the year of birth, a newborn is either an 
ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat or sheep, monkey, rooster, dog, 
pig or rat. 
</P>
<P>
The snake ranks among the least desirable. Snake babies are thought to produce 
adults equated with double-dealing, scandal and disreputable behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"Many still believe the zodiac is not a bunch of mumbo jumbo," said <PERSON>Paul Wee</PERSON>, 
who would like to become a father but perhaps not in the Year of the <ORGANIZATION>Snake</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
During the last Year of the <ORGANIZATION>Snake</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1977</DATE>, births declined by <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT>. 
</P>
<P>
"There are great people born under every one of the zodiac signs," said Yeo, 
whose population planners fear that a badly needed baby boom is about to 
fizzle. 
</P>
<P>
"The world would be a sadder and poorer place if the capable were born only 
once every 12 years." 
</P>
<P>
He said snake babies include <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Presidents <PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Abraham 
Lincoln</PERSON>, the late Chinese leader <PERSON>Mao Tse-tung</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>'s Deputy Prime 
Minister <PERSON>Goh Chok Tong</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Singapore needs five years matching <DATE>1988</DATE>'s 50,000 births to reverse a shrinking 
population. If a lower birth rate resumes, officials predict that the current 
population of 2.6 million will start shrinking precariously in the year <DATE>2010</DATE> 
and nose-dive thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
"We must change our thinking," said <PERSON>Yeo</PERSON>. "We should not consider the other 
zodiac signs as being less favorable than the dragon." 
</P>
<P>
So elaborate ceremonies welcoming snake year were planned for the start of the 
lunar new year on <DATE>Monday</DATE>, <DATE>Feb. 6</DATE>. The <LOCATION>Singapore River</LOCATION> is to be transformed into 
a carnival with fireworks and giant lotus flowers spraying colorful water jets. 
There will be a display of 600 snakes, including such rarities as the white 
cobra, double-headed versions, gold-ringed, bamboo and water species. 
</P>
<P>
Government matchmakers touting the joys of matrimony and progeny are stressing 
the positive aspects of the snake personality. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Susan Chan</PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION>Social Development Unit</ORGANIZATION>, said snake types 
often make their way to the top, ensure that they are in the right place at the 
right time and demonstrate an aptitude for research and academics. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just going to forge ahead in our programs" encouraging singles to marry 
and start families, <PERSON>Chan</PERSON> said.

   Sometimes, love reins, especially
when a couple in their finest Western duds exchanges marriage vows
while sitting atop their horses in ``Bonanza'' country.
   <PERSON>Carol Clifford</PERSON>, 47, and <PERSON>B.D. Lapham</PERSON>, 46, said they decided to
tie the knot on horseback <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME> in this town near <PERSON>Ben
Cartwright</PERSON>'s Ponderosa ranch on the old ``Bonanza'' TV series
because of their love of horses.
   With more than 150 guests watching from hay bales, the couple
said their ``I do's'' in front of a hitching post. But before they
could kiss, the crowd's clapping spooked the horses, causing them
to gallop up a hill. The couple later walked back in with the
horses.
   They originally planned to have a small wedding. ``But then I
said `Let's get married on the horses' and friends started asking
if they could come to the ceremony,'' <PERSON>Lapham</PERSON> said.
   Like their ceremony, their invitations were unusual. They were
designed like an old wanted poster and a friend shot bullets
through all of them.
   They met earlier this year when <PERSON>Clifford</PERSON>, a Reno newspaper
classified ad supervisor, was out walking. She met <PERSON>Lapham</PERSON> outside
the <ORGANIZATION>Cowboys &amp; Indians</ORGANIZATION> saloon he manages, putting out his flags.
   She stopped and said, ``Oh, you have nice flags,'' and the

<TEXT>
   A snake-venom researcher bitten by a deadly
viper rested comfortably <DATE>Sunday</DATE> while doctors considered whether to
treat him with antivenins from <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, a
hospital spokesman said.
   <PERSON>William E. Haast</PERSON>, 78, remained in serious but stable condition at
the <ORGANIZATION>University of Utah Health Sciences Center</ORGANIZATION> after being bitten on
the left hand <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by a Pakistani pit viper, also known as a
saw-scaled viper, said hospital spokesman <PERSON>John Dwan</PERSON>.
   ``<PERSON>Mr. Haast</PERSON> is resting very comfortably, eating and chatting with
friends,'' <PERSON>Dwan</PERSON> said. ``He's just in danger, if you will.''
   Haast, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Miami Serpentarium Laboratories</ORGANIZATION> at the
university's <ORGANIZATION>Research Park</ORGANIZATION>, has been bitten 148 times by snakes and
is immune to the venom of dozens of reptiles. But he had no immunity
to the viper's bite and checked himself into the hospital <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   The saw-scaled viper's venom attacks its victim's ability to
produce fibrinogen, an element of blood that regulates coagulation.
A lack of fibrinogen can cause uncontrolled bleeding.
   <PERSON>Dwan</PERSON> said the level of <LOCATION>Haast</LOCATION>'s fibrinogen had been improving
slightly although it remained ``dangerously low'' <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   Doctors were replacing <PERSON>Haast</PERSON>'s fibrinogen with transfusions and
it appeared his system had begun to produce it again, <PERSON>Dwan</PERSON> said.
   He said <PERSON>Haast</PERSON>'s blood was being analyzed every four hours, and
that by <DATE>late Saturday</DATE> his fibrogen level was about one-third of
normal. On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, he said, ``for all intents and purposes (it
was) at zero.''
   Haast's plight prompted an effort by <PERSON>Stephen Studdernt</PERSON>, special
assistant to President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, to coordinate the acquisition of
antivenins from the three nations and expedite shipment to <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Dwan</PERSON> said antivenins from <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> had arrived, but he
did not know if the one from the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> had. The antivenin
from <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> was more specifically made to counteract venom from the
species of viper that bit <LOCATION>Haast</LOCATION>, he said.
   However, he said doctors were ``very leery about giving
medication to someone from a source about which we know very little
about.''
   Antivenins are made from horse serum and can cause negative side
effects such as lung and kidney problems, he said.
   ``We want to emphasize the fact that we're grateful to everyone
who went to such great lengths to get the antivenin,'' <PERSON>Dwan</PERSON> said.
``The decision on whether to use them or not will be based on <PERSON>Mr.
Haast</PERSON>'s condition. Hopefully we won't have to use them.''
   Haast had been treated earlier with antivenins from <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s
<LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION> and from a lab in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, but <PERSON>Dwan</PERSON> said <DATE>Saturday</DATE>
he had not been given antivenins for about 24 hours.
   He said doctors also had contacted scientists and physicans in
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, across the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> to discuss treatment.
   ``It's a special kind of snake, with a special kind of poison,
and the immunology is complicated,'' <PERSON>Dwan</PERSON> said. ``Our physicians
aren't just winging it on their own.''
   <PERSON>Studdert</PERSON> said the Iranian government apparently did not interfere
with the shipment of the antivenin despite the strained relations
between the two nations. Iranian leader <PERSON>Ayatolla Khomeini</PERSON> has often
called the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> the ``great Satan.''
   The Pakistani pit viper is one of 1,000 exotic, poisonous snakes
<LOCATION>Haast</LOCATION> keeps at the laboratory, where their venom is extracted for
sale to universities and health organizations for research and the
manufacture of antivenins.

<TEXT>
   St. <PERSON>Patrick</PERSON> may have chased the snakes from
<LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>, but unlike the winner of an upcoming contest here, he
didn't get a pickup truck for the accomplishment.
   That's what this <LOCATION>Pacific island</LOCATION> is offering to the person who can
collect the most brown tree snakes in a one-month period starting
<DATE>June 23</DATE>.
   The first annual ``Sweep Snakes'' contest is part of an effort to
rid the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> territory of the more than 2 million brown tree snakes
that have infested the 212-square-mile island.
   The snakes were accidentally imported to <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> during World War
II, possibly in military cargo shipments from the <LOCATION>Solomon Islands</LOCATION>.
Since then, they have decimated the native bird population and are
known to bite humans occasionally.
   Although the venom is not lethal to adults, it can put small
infants into shock and, if untreated, can cause death.
   Other prizes in the contest include awards for the longest tree
snake captured and the most innovative trap.

   A couple saved a 7-day-old

inside the snake and forced it to cough up the pet, a newspaper
reported <DATE>Friday</DATE>. Two other puppies died.
   Magda and <PERSON>Hennie Botha</PERSON> were quoted as telling The Star newspaper
they heard their terrier barking frantically outside her kennel on
their farm near <LOCATION>Nelspruit</LOCATION>, 15 miles west of <ORGANIZATION>Kruger National Park</ORGANIZATION>.
   When they rushed outside, the python was curled up inside the
kennel, the puppies were gone, and the couple said they heard faint
yelps from inside the snake's stomach.
   <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> said while his wife held the snake's tail, he shook the
head up and down and rubbed its bulging stomach. The reptile's jaws
gaped, and out came the three puppies. Two were dead.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Botha</PERSON> massaged the third puppy's chest and moved its front

   The snake was kept in the bathroom overnight to keep it away
from other animals, then was dropped off several miles away the

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of video rental shops on <DATE>Friday</DATE> received
promotional kits for a horror movie with live snakes inside the
packages, and outraged animal protection officials called the stunt
``cruel and irresponsible.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>Royal Society</ORGANIZATION> for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals called
on <ORGANIZATION>Cinema International Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to take back the 700 reptiles.
   The snakes were in danger because instructions accompanying the
kits had incorrectly said they did not need to be fed for their
planned month-long stay in the stores, the society said.
   It said it was receiving dozens of calls from unhappy shop owners.
   <PERSON>Paul Brett</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>CIC</ORGANIZATION>'s marketing manager, said the snakes were
intended to be kept in shops to promote a thriller about voodoo
called ``The Serpent and The Rainbow.''
   The snakes were bred domestically and the company began sending
them out <DATE>Thursday</DATE> from its <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> headquarters, he said.
   The snakes, silver with gray stripes, are not poisonous but might
carry harmful parasites if they came from abroad, said <ORGANIZATION>RSPCA</ORGANIZATION>
spokeswoman <PERSON>Diana Jones</PERSON>. They needed to be fed weekly, she said.
   While admitting there'd been ``some confusion,'' <ORGANIZATION>Cinema
International</ORGANIZATION> denied the snakes would harm anyone or be harmed.
   ``We've sent out 700 in clear, plastic, aerated boxes as
conversation pieces,'' <PERSON>Brett</PERSON> said. ``Snakes make wonderful pets.''
   The 18- to 24-inch snakes used in the promotion came from a
company called Animal Actors, which assured <ORGANIZATION>Cinema International</ORGANIZATION>
they did not have to be fed for three months, he said.
   Lawrence Cane, <ORGANIZATION>Cinema International</ORGANIZATION>'s marketing assistant, said:
``Whenever we launch a new video title we normally send to our
distributors posters, sleeves and cardboard cut-outs. With this
film, we decided to send snakes. In marketing terms it's called live
points of sale.''
   Some recipients weren't impressed.
   ``We felt complete and utter horror,'' said a <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> video shop
manager, who refused to be identified to protect his relations with
the distribution company. ``I deplore any living creature used for
advertising.''
   He said the snake, which ``just appeared out of the blue,'' had
been returned to the distribution company's animal supplier.
   <PERSON>Brett</PERSON> said the snakes were hand-delivered in boxes marked ``Live
Animal,'' and claimed shop owners were warned by ads in the trade
press and calls from sales agents.
   At the end of the month, they were to be collected by the
company, although if shop owners were unhappy, they could call an
emergency number and have them picked up.
   ``I have spoken to three (shop owners) who were less than
happy,'' <PERSON>Brett</PERSON> said. ``If we find we were wrong about feeding, then
obviously we will take action on that and pull them back
immediately.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Jones</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>RSPCA</ORGANIZATION> was urging unhappy owners to demand that
the company take them back, and if they didn't, the <ORGANIZATION>RSPCA</ORGANIZATION> might take
some.
   ``We don't have the resources to take care of hundreds of
snakes,'' she said.
   <PERSON>Robert Cottrill</PERSON>, assistant manager at <ORGANIZATION>Video Palace</ORGANIZATION> shop in
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Soho district</LOCATION>, said he didn't particularly mind the snake,
whom the staff immediately nicknamed ``Cyril,'' but thought the
whole stunt was ``cruel and crass.''
   ``It's a pretty second-rate film,'' he said. ``I think they knew
full well that all this would happen.''

<TEXT>
   In the land where it was born, the
ancient art of snake charming is dying and its half million
practioners are vanishing.
   Hunger haunts them. Police chase them. Ecologists despise them.
People on the street no longer care for them.
   ``Snake charming is no more a paying profession,'' said
90-year-old <PERSON>Sunder Nath</PERSON>. ``Our children are not interested in snake
charming any more. There is not enough money, not enough charm left.
   ``Our children want to become clerks, bus drivers, even
policemen, but not snake charmers.''
   Although he walks with the aid of a stick, <ORGANIZATION>Nath</ORGANIZATION> still holds road
side shows.
   The guru and saint of snake charmers is <PERSON>Gorak Nath</PERSON>, who they say
lived 500 years ago, and all snake charmers take his last name.
   Molarband, about 20 miles south of <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>, is one of the two
villages in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> exclusively inhabited by snake charmers. The
other village is in the state of <LOCATION>Orissa</LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>.
   About 1,500 snake charmers live in <LOCATION>Molarband</LOCATION> in mud-and-stone
homes. Each home has 10 to 15 snakes.
   ``Gone are the days when our children lived with snakes, grew
with snakes,'' said <PERSON>Prabhu Nath</PERSON>, 50, whose two children attend a
government-run school not far from <LOCATION>Mokarband</LOCATION>. ``Now they are going
to schools to learn English.''
   ``When I grow up I would like to become bus driver,'' said
15-year-old <PERSON>Rajpal Nath</PERSON>, a ninth grader. ``My friends tell me that
snake charming is nothing but another form of begging. I don't want
to be called a beggar.''
   ``There is no value in our father's work. We are looked down by
everyone,'' added 14-year-old <PERSON>Rameshchand Nath</PERSON>, who wants to be a
bank clerk.
   About 250 of the 1,500 students at the school near <LOCATION>Molarband</LOCATION> are
from families of snake charmers.
   ``This is remarkable,'' said <PERSON>Ram Lal Longia</PERSON>, the school's
headmaster. ``Ten years back, we hardly had any student from the
snake charmers' families.''
   Experts say the ranks of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s 500,000 snake charmers are
declining fast.
   ``There are no new charmers joining the clan. What we have is
the old stock,'' said <PERSON>Komolesh Dev</PERSON>, who has spent months in
<LOCATION>Molarband</LOCATION> studying the life of the snake charmer.
   ``There was a time when snake charmers were part of Indian life,
they provided the best and cheapest entertainment.
   ``But today who cares for them? They are remembered only once a
year during the snake festival.''
   Every year on ``Nag Panchimi,'' or Snake God festival day,
Hindus pray to snakes and feed them. The brave among them wear
snakes around their necks and some even pose with them for
photographs.
   Women make snake beds in their homes and pray to snakes to give
them sons.
   ``Only on that day we are in great demand,'' said <PERSON>Sambhu Nath</PERSON>.
``We offer our snakes for hire and make good money. But it is only
one day of bright sunshine in a year.''
   A team of two snake charmers on the average makes about 75
rupees (<MONEY>$5</MONEY>) a day.
   ``From this amount we bribe the police, feed our snakes and run
our families,'' <PERSON>Sambhu Nath</PERSON> said.
   But there is no business during monsoon season and parts of
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s blistering <DATE>summer</DATE>.
   The Indian Wildlife Act prohibits the possession, sale or
purchase of about 30 of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s 240 species of reptiles, and the
ban includes the King Cobra, the most prized possession of a snake
charmer.
   ``You can't hold a show with rat snake,'' <PERSON>Prakash Nath</PERSON> said.
``It ought to be a King Cobra or at least a cobra. ... Only then
people are interested.
   ``First, it is difficult to find a cobra because forests are
vanishing and when we find one, we can't keep it forever as it is
against our tradition.'' When a snake charmer decides catches a
snake, he performs a rite and pledges to release it within a year.

<HEAD>Snakes Win Round At Rattlesnake Rodeo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OPP, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Operators of a rattlesnake rodeo, rattled by
criticism that they could be driving the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> diamondback to
extinction, returned their catch to the wild <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   Because the 150 snakes were freed at the end of the two-day
event, no rattlesnake meat was on sale at Opp's 30th Rattlesnake
Rodeo for the thousands of people who attended. The meat had been
one of the better drawing cards over the years.
   In previous years, most of the 150 to 300 snakes that were
rounded up were either killed for their meat or sold to researchers
or snake exhibitors.
   ``We've been getting criticism for years from environmentalists,
animal rights groups and others about the way we did some things,''
said <PERSON>Jerry Hartzog</PERSON>, head snake handler for the Opp Jaycees. ``They
say we could be putting the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> diamondback in danger of
extinction or something, so we've started working with them.''
   But the move brought criticism from residents who are upset at
the prospect of the snakes being turned loose in their southern
<LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> community, <PERSON>Hartzog</PERSON> said.
   ``I reckon some people think we're going to just dump all of them
in one place,'' he added. ``That's not the case at all. We're going
to release the snakes back into the wild as close to where each was
caught as possible.''
   Others, like veteran snake hunter <ORGANIZATION>J.P. Jones</ORGANIZATION>, think the snakes
should be killed because they are a danger to hunters and others.
   ``If they (environmentalists) could see a little child die from a
rattlesnake bite like happened down here once, they'd change their
tune, I think,'' said <PERSON>Jones</PERSON>, the 68-year-old founder of the
rattlesnake roundup.
   The snakes originally were caught to make the woods safer for
hunters, he said.
   Before this year, the rodeo has raised more than <MONEY>$21,000</MONEY> for
charity.

<TEXT>
   An accident that overturned two boats
and swept a fisherman to his death under a <LOCATION>Lake Okeechobee</LOCATION> lock
gate was probably caused by a 5-foot chicken snake, an investigator
said.
   ``Sometimes the truth sounds very abstract,'' said <PERSON>Don Grey</PERSON> of
the <ORGANIZATION>Florida Marine Patrol</ORGANIZATION>. ``But I'm <PERCENT>95 percent</PERCENT> positive. As
far-fetched as it sounds, I have to go with it.''
   The snake apparently crawled over an electrical switch while the
two boats were in the chamber between the water-controlling gates
of a lock <DATE>March 3</DATE>. The locks are equipped with gates to change
water levels to raise or lower boats so they can enter and leave
<LOCATION>Lake Okeechobee</LOCATION>.
   The reptile's weight _ probably about two pounds, a snake expert
said _ put enough pressure on the switch to send a signal one lock
gate was shut when it actually was raised two to three feet, <PERSON>Grey</PERSON>
said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   That triggered the raising of the other gate, causing water to
rush into the chamber prematurely, swamping the boats and pulling
<PERSON>Hubert Major</PERSON>, 68, under one of the gates.
   Major, a retired engineer who lived in <LOCATION>Lakeport</LOCATION>, drowned in the
turbulent water. The other boater, <PERSON>Donald Blickenstaff</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Sharpsburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, was able to reach a ladder on the wall and climb
out.
   The <ORGANIZATION>South Florida Water Management District</ORGANIZATION> has installed a
second switch on the other side of the gate in an effort to prevent
future accidents.
   ``There will have to be a 15-foot-long snake, or two snakes
working in cahoots with each other, to trip both of those switches
now,'' said <PERSON>Francis Davino</PERSON>, contract locktender at <LOCATION>Lakeport</LOCATION>.
   Chicken snakes, also called yellow rat snakes, are a common,
non-poisonous family of reptiles that can grow to 7{ feet. They
climb the lock structures to find warmth, <PERSON>Davino</PERSON> said.

   They usually visit around Labor Day. Most arrive by the
front door, a few through the flue; and how did you get in I
remember thinking, noticing one lounging by the heat vent
near the stereo.
   Sometimes I reach for a hammer. But mostly into a bucket
they go, scooped up for a trip down the driveway to the
annoying neighbor's rotting car collection. After three
years, my ring snakes and I get along just fine during that
brief annual moment when their need for a toasty place brings
us close.

   So it was with great interest that I turned to two new
books describing the complex relationships we, well, some of
us, forge with nonhumans: <PERSON>Thomas Palmer</PERSON>'s "Landscape With
Reptile: Rattlesnakes in the Urban World" (<ORGANIZATION>Ticknor &amp; Fields</ORGANIZATION>,
340 pages, <MONEY>$19.95</MONEY>) and <PERSON>Stephen Budiansky</PERSON>'s "The Covenant of
the Wild: Why Animals Chose Domestication" (<ORGANIZATION>Morrow</ORGANIZATION>, 190
pages, <MONEY>$18</MONEY>). <PERSON>Mr. Budiansky</PERSON>, a science writer who owns a small
farm in <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>, suggests that many animals actually prefer
to live with people who eat them and buy them tartan-lined
sleeping baskets from <LOCATION>L.L. Bean</LOCATION>. It is the end result of a
process put in motion long ago, he argues, an evolutionary
response to the upheavals of the last Ice Age, when a closer
relationship with human beings benefited those animals who
eventually ended up on our farms and in our laps.
   Cats, for instance, who are fed out of costly tin cans and
yet do nothing but stare sleepily at invading ring snakes,
cut a pretty good deal for themselves. Crotalus horridus
seems to be less sociable than my little wigglers and about
four times longer besides, to judge by <PERSON>Mr. Palmer</PERSON>'s ode to
the shy, venomous rattlesnake. Crotalus only bonds with
humans under duress: You must pet it or step on it. Mostly,
<ORGANIZATION>Crotalus</ORGANIZATION> likes to take in the sun in total privacy on stony
crags. For this life style, the <LOCATION>Blue Hills</LOCATION>, a few busy
highway miles outside <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> and close to <PERSON>Mr. Palmer</PERSON>'s home,
are ideal. At least they were until the arrival of the
Puritans, who considered <ORGANIZATION>Crotalus</ORGANIZATION> and its relatives the
confidential agents of Satan. The Indians got on with
<ORGANIZATION>Crotalus</ORGANIZATION> just fine, as <PERSON>Mr. Palmer</PERSON> doesn't fail to point out,
adding without obvious irony that they sometimes sacrificed
dogs to the snake deity. (But <PERSON>Mr. Palmer</PERSON> is strictly a snake
man; in a rather astonishing passage, he takes fright at some
cows who have ambled into the <LOCATION>Blue Hills</LOCATION>.)
   By now shovels, hatchets, guns and dynamite have so
reduced <ORGANIZATION>Crotalus</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, rattlers are virtually
extinct. Not surprisingly, <PERSON>Mr. Palmer</PERSON> gets few glimpses of
his "hero" and fleshes out his nature walks with often
engaging stories drawn from local lore, medical reports and
novels. This is probably the only book that discusses a
wretched novel by <PERSON>Oliver Wendell Holmes</PERSON> from the viewpoint of
the (maligned) rattlesnake. But it helps <PERSON>Mr. Palmer</PERSON>, a
novelist and amateur naturalist, make the point he wants to
in this rambling, quirky book: Snake murderers usually don't
bother with the facts.
   Among other things, and never mind its fearsome
reputation, <ORGANIZATION>Crotalus</ORGANIZATION>'s bite is very rarely lethal -- though
painful certainly, which <PERSON>Mr. Palmer</PERSON> doesn't deny in some
sparkling descriptions of arms turning into bloated red hams.
But as <PERSON>Mr. Palmer</PERSON> notes: "Certain prejudices, it seems, are
so ingrown their removal would require surgery."
   <PERSON>Mr. Budiansky</PERSON> would also dispel some prejudices having to
do with humans, specifically farmers. "This book," he writes,
"was born in part of my experiences as an imposter farmer; in
part of my fascination with archaeological and behavioral
research that is beginning to reveal domestication of animals
as a natural product of evolution; and in part of my anger at
the simplistic stereotypes of man and nature that are being
purveyed by an ever more confrontational animal rights
movement to an ever more urban audience."
   Animals munching on other animals who are still alive;
agonizing deaths from parasites: These are not scenes that
keep the phones ringing at <ORGANIZATION>PBS</ORGANIZATION> stations come fund-raising
time. That Mother Nature is one cruel mommy to many of her
flock is a truth that gets less media time than stories of
stuffed geese, shackled lambs or penned hens. <PERSON>Mr. Budiansky</PERSON>
doesn't deny that some farm animals are mistreated, that some
lab experiments are nonsense. But his slim, elegant discourse
is a persuasive counterweight to the pastoral delusions of
sentimentalists intent on seeing humans as malevolently at
odds with the noble animal kingdom.
   In fact, writes <PERSON>Mr. Budiansky</PERSON>, it is time to question
conventional wisdom that insists humans chose to domesticate
food animals and ask, instead, what was in it for them, for
the animals. Did they choose us? The reindeer, for example,
so enjoys the salty taste of human urine, it would probably
feel deprived of a delicacy if it were liberated into lonely
loops around the <LOCATION>North Pole</LOCATION>. Turning to animals closer to
home, sheep and cattle, <PERSON>Mr. Budiansky</PERSON> suggests that "the
advantages of extra food and protection from predators would
outweigh the disadvantages of being preyed on by humans."
   Well, we can't ask them. But it makes sense that a hostile
environment would bring animals and humans closer together.
These days, figuring out how to share this earth with animals
when most people are quite disconnected from nature (or
reality for that matter) is not easy. But it seems even to
this sentimental vegetarian, who eats nothing with big brown
eyes -- yet isn't keen on snake stew either -- that animals
and humans have a sane friend in <PERSON>Mr. Budiansky</PERSON>.
