   Voyager 2 brushed by <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s north pole
and photographed volcanoes that once gushed ice lava on frosty,
fault-cracked <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, revealing ``a world unlike any we've ever
seen,'' <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   ``All we can say now is, wow! _ what a way to leave the solar
system,'' said <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION> geologist <PERSON>Laurence Soderblom</PERSON>,
deputy leader of Voyager's photographic imaging team.
   The one-ton space probe capped its historic 4.43-billion mile,
12-year tour of four planets when it skimmed 3,048 miles over
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s north pole <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, then dove past <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, the
planet's largest moon. It made its closest approach about 23,900
miles above the moon's surface at <TIME>2:10 a.m PDT</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   ``We are witness today to truly an amazing feat of American space
technology,'' Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON> told hundreds of scientists
and dignitaries <DATE>Friday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``I am exceedingly
delighted to be here on this very historic day for <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s space program.''
   During its approach to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, Voyager discovered six moons in
addition to <LOCATION>Nereid</LOCATION> and frost-covered <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, which were first
observed from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The spaceship also discovered one complete ring of debris around
the planet and a partial ring, or ring arc, scientists believe will
also prove to be a complete ring.
   Voyager's closest photos of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> were recorded on tape for
playback to earth this <DATE>weekend</DATE>, but those returned <DATE>Friday</DATE> astounded
scientists. <PERSON>Soderblom</PERSON> said they showed at least three volcanoes, now
inactive, that once produced flows of viscous ice _ perhaps frozen
natural gas or nitrogen ice.
   ``The images returned this morning revealed a world unlike any
we've ever seen,'' said Voyager project scientist <ORGANIZATION>Edward Stone</ORGANIZATION>.
   While icy volcanic flows without associated craters have been
seen on Uranus' moon <PERSON>Ariel</PERSON> and some other moons, ``it's the first
time we've seen an icy volcano,'' Stone said, referring to one of
the huge craters on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>. ``This is a real volcano.''
   But Stone noted that <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s volcanoes are ``filled with ice
instead of rock. The lava flow is a flow of ice, not of rock.''
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> geologist <PERSON>Joseph Boyce</PERSON> said one of the ice volcanoes _ which
look like dry lakebeds filled with smooth material _ measures
several hundred miles across.
   Other <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> photos showed long fault lines, ridges, low-lying
cliffs and ``ice structures of various sorts, like glacier
terrain,'' <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> scientist <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON> said. ``They're like
things you see in polar caps on Mars.''
   ``It looks like there's all kinds of fault systems all over the
place,'' <PERSON>Soderblom</PERSON> said, adding that the faults suggest
``Tritonquakes'' may have occurred at one time on the moon.
   Also visible were some meteorite impact craters, and long sets of
parallel ridges bounding apparent valleys filled with icy ``erupted
plastic masses,'' he said. The icy flows either poured down valleys
or erupted from valley floors, similar to what happens if someone is
``using a razor and slicing open the side of a toothpaste tube,''
<PERSON>Soderblom</PERSON> said.
   He said scientists don't yet know the makeup of the volcanic ices
and other ice flows, or when the volcanoes last erupted.
   Earth and <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s moon Io are the only objects in the solar
system known to have volcanoes that are currently active.
   Voyager also revealed <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> has an atmosphere, as predicted.
It's content wasn't immediately determined, but <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said the haze
might be like photochemical smog.
   Stone said the discovery that <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s surface once was
geologically active supports the theory that the backward-orbiting
moon _ about four-fifths the size of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s moon _ once was a
comet-like, sun-orbiting object captured into orbit around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   Under that theory, <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> initially would have orbited <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> in
a long ellipse, but <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s gravity slowly pulled it into a
circular orbit, making <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> a semi-molten, geologically active
ball for the first billion years after its capture, he said.
   By <TIME>9 a.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, Voyager will be 2.753 billion miles from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 1.385 million miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, speeding away from the
giant planet at 37,847 mph.
   The spacecraft revealed 400-mph winds in <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s bluish
atmosphere, as well as cloud ``streamers'' stretching thousands of
miles, and an assortment of storms, including an Earth-sized cyclone
called the Great Dark Spot.
   Voyager 2 was launched in <DATE>1977</DATE> and explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>. Its trip to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> followed a
4.43-billion mile curving path, although the planet is now 2.75
billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Voyager 1 also was launched in <DATE>1977</DATE>, exploring <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>
and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE> before speeding out of the plane of the planets.
   Until its official ``near encounter'' period ends <DATE>Oct. 2</DATE>, Voyager
2 will look back over its shoulder at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>. Then it, like Voyager
1, will head toward interstellar space.
   ``Voyager 2 is now past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and is continuing to press
outward into the darkest and farthest region of the solar system,''
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON>Richard Truly</PERSON> said. ``The Voyagers are destined
to wander through the Milky Way. ... What wonders they will
encounter.''
   <PERSON>Lennard Fisk</PERSON>, an associate administrator of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>, called the
climax of the Voyager mission historic because ``it's the last time
we're seeing a planet for the first time. We've completed the
reconnaissance of the planets, except <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>.''

   Voyager 1, which joined its twin
exploring the outer solar system, will snap pictures this week to
make an unprecedented family portrait of most of the planets and
the vast empty space between them.
   ``It will speak more to the mind than to the eye because of the
tremendous distances. What will be impressive will be the
distances,'' said <PERSON>Jurrie van der Woude</PERSON>, a spokesman at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
   The complete portrait will be too large to be published, but
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> may assemble the 64 eight-by-10-inch photos into a mosaic
stretching 100 to 150 feet along a wall at the laboratory.
   <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, Uranus, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, Mars, <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> will
appear as tiny dots against a background of dark space and the
constellation Eridanus.
   Mercury will be hidden by the sun's glare. <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION> is too distant
to appear in any images.
   While the solar system portrait won't have scientific value, its
purpose is ``really historical,'' said <PERSON>Bob MacMillin</PERSON>, a spokesman
for the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``This is not just the first time, but perhaps the only time for
decades that we'll be able to take a picture of the planets from
outside the solar system,'' said Voyager project scientist <ORGANIZATION>Edward
Stone</ORGANIZATION>.
   Voyager 1, which is about 3.7 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, will use
its two cameras to photograph the planets and the sun between <TIME>5:15
p.m.</TIME> and <TIME>9:20 p.m. PST Tuesday night</TIME>.
   Because of other demands on <ORGANIZATION>NASA Deep Space Network</ORGANIZATION> tracking
antennas, the photos won't be sent back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> until late <DATE>March</DATE>,
and it will be late <DATE>April</DATE> until they are processed and can be
assembled into a mosaic, <PERSON>MacMillin</PERSON> said.
   The twin Voyager spacecraft were launched from <LOCATION>Cape Canaveral</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1977</DATE> and explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>. Voyager 2 explored
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE>, Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE> and <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> <DATE>last August</DATE>. Voyager 1
explored <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE>, then flew above the plane in which the
planets orbit the sun, known as the ecliptic plane.
   Photographing the sun for the solar system portrait may warp the
shutter blades on Voyager 1's wide-angle camera, but there are no
plans to use the camera again anyway, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Voyager 1 will take the photos for the solar system portrait by
looking down from a position 32 degrees above the ecliptic plane.
Stone said no future missions are planned that would send a
spacecraft so high above the ecliptic plane.
   Voyager 1 was chosen to make the photograph because it is in
better position that Voyager 2.
   Both spacecraft are now studying electrically charged particles
and magnetic fields as they fly toward interstellar space. They are
expected to return at least limited measurements for another 25 to
30 years.

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers were unwilling to wait
until <DATE>October</DATE> to see the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft's photographs of Venus,
so they used an experimental method to get three of the pictures
sent to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> early.
   One of the photos released <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> shows clouds as small as 25
miles wide as well as clouds rising from lower in the atmosphere.
It was taken <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> when the Jupiter-bound <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was about
1 million miles past <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, the second planet from the sun.
   ``You can see clouds, and you can see some very interesting
detail in the cloud patterns,'' said <PERSON>Neal Ausman</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> mission
director at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet
Propulsion Laboratory. ``The engineers and scientists are
exceptionally pleased.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to go into orbit around <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>December
1995</DATE> in a <MONEY>$1.35 billion</MONEY> mission to study the solar system's largest
planet. Just before <TIME>10 p.m. PST</TIME> <DATE>last Friday</DATE>, the spacecraft swooped
about 10,025 miles over <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> so that planet could act as a gravity
slingshot to help hurl the spacecraft on its way to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Most of the photographs and other data collected during and
after the flyby won't be sent back until <DATE>October</DATE>, when the
spacecraft is closer to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s main antenna now is furled
to protect it from the heat of the sun. A smaller antenna, which
can transmit and receive information only at a very slow rate, is
being used almost exclusively to operate the spacecraft.
   But <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers were able to get <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> to send the three
photos back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> and <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by transferring separate
batches of the computer data that make up each image for radio
transmission, <PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Jim Wilson</PERSON> called the technique ``experimental
and difficult.''
   <PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said engineers also were able to get the spacecraft to
send back some infrared light measurements designed to study <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>'
lower atmosphere, as well as ultraviolet light measurements and
data from sensors designed to detect dust and magnetic fields in
space around <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>.
   By the time <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s fly-by of Venus formally ends <DATE>Friday</DATE>
<TIME>night</TIME>, the spacecraft's television camera will have taken about 80
pictures of cloud-shrouded <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   Many other spacecraft have photographed <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, some from much
closer than <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>. But the new photos still should have
scientific value, <PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was deployed from the space shuttle Atlantis last <DATE>Oct.
18</DATE> on a looping 2.4 billion, six-year route that requires <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and
Earth to be used as gravity slingshots to hurl the spacecraft to
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. It will fly past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> on <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE>, then again on <DATE>Dec. 8,
1992</DATE>.
   Meanwhile, in the outer reaches of the solar system, the Voyager
1 spacecraft sent radio signals indicating it had successfully
snapped photographs to make up the first group portrait of the
solar system, according to <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Mary Hardin</PERSON>.
   Voyager 1, which photographed <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>1981</DATE>, was ordered to shoot the pictures <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>. But it
took five hours and 36 minutes for confirmation of the photographs
to travel the 3.7 billion miles to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Hardin</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.

   After a 12-year, 4.4 billion-mile space
odyssey, Voyager 2 fired its thrusters today to take final aim
toward <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, the most distant and last unexplored planet due for
a visit by a spacecraft from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   ``This is the final movement in the Voyager symphony of the outer
planets,'' said Voyager project scientist <PERSON>Edward Stone</PERSON>, referring to
<ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s previous exploration of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus.
   ``We're in for a good ride, and it's great everybody can share in
the discoveries that are going to unfold in the <DATE>next week</DATE>,'' Stone
said during a <TIME>late morning</TIME> news conference.
   The small adjustment in direction today was the last needed to
target Voyager for <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s close encounter with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and
<DATE>Friday</DATE>'s flight past its largest moon, <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>. The maneuver, meant
to nudge Voyager to the right and increased its speed a tiny 1.1
mph, means <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will fly closest to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> about <TIME>8:55 p.m. PDT</TIME>
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   Engineers at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory received a signal
from the spacecraft at <TIME>8:15 a.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>today</DATE> indicating the thrusters
started firing at <TIME>4:09 a.m</TIME>. It takes four hours and six minutes for
the signals to reach Earth, even at the 186,000-mile-per-second
speed of light.
   The approaching encounter with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> has drawn scientists here
from all over the world.
   ``It's almost like being on a ship of discovery like <PERSON>Marco Polo</PERSON>,
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>,'' says <PERSON>Jurrie</PERSON> van der Woude, a laboratory
spokesman.
   ``For most of us, this is the last picture show, the last foreign
shores we visit in the solar system.''
   Today's schedule of activities for Voyager included searching for
northern lights around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s north pole, studying the planet's
turbulent weather and snapping pictures of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> and another moon,
<LOCATION>Nereid</LOCATION>. The probe also was programmed to make 39 images of the
region in which partial rings of debris may be orbiting the planet.
   As Voyager gets nearer to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, cable television stations will
carry live <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> broadcasts of photographs from the planet.
   On its approach to the solar system's fourth-largest planet, the
picture-snapping space probe already has discovered four moons in
addition to <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> and Nereid, which had been discovered from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,
as well as two partial rings of debris orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   Voyager also discovered <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> has a magnetic field;
hurricane-like storms dubbed ``scooters'' with 400 mph winds;
2,700-mile-wide bands vaguely like <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s jet streams; and a
8,100-by-4,100-mile Great Dark Spot, probably a huge storm like
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> listed <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s position as of <TIME>9 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>today</DATE> as 2.743
billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 3.211 million miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>,
approaching the planet at 42,310 mph. Since it was launched in <DATE>1977</DATE>,
Voyager 2 has traveled a curving path totaling 4.4 billion miles.
   With no one planning a mission to <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> is the last
unexplored planet that will be visited by a spacecraft from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in
the foreseeable future.
   <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, usually the eighth planet from the sun, currently is the
ninth and most distant. Pluto follows an elongated elliptical orbit
and is closer now.
   <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> makes its closest approach to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> by
skirting 3,000 miles above the planet's cloud tops _ much closer
than its encounters with <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus
in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   <DATE>Sunday</DATE> was the 12th anniversary of the spacecraft's launch from
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 20, 1977</DATE>. The <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> encounter is the climax of the
<MONEY>$865 million</MONEY>, twin-spacecraft Voyager mission, which also saw
Voyager 1 explore <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   Sending Voyager to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> was like ``sinking a 2,260-mile golf
putt, assuming the golfer can make a few illegal fine adjustments
while the ball is rolling across this incredibly long green,''
according to ``The Voyager Neptune Travel Guide,'' written by
mission planning manager <PERSON>Charles Kohlhase</PERSON> and his staff.
   About 170 researchers from around the world are at the laboratory
for the <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> encounter. They will share ultimate exhilaration as
front-row observers for humanity's first close-up look at the
planet, a blue-green ball nearly four times <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s diameter.
   But their excitement is tinged with nostalgia because Voyager's
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> encounter will be the last planetary flyby for a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
spacecraft. Future probes will orbit their target planets: <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
at <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and the Mars Observer.
   Up to 8,000 photographs from Voyager's two television cameras and
discoveries by 10 other science experiments are expected to pour in
so quickly that the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>
will conduct daily news conferences through <DATE>Aug. 29</DATE>.
   Some scientists have said the planet may have 50 or more ring
arcs, different than the complete rings encircling <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus.
   They also say <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s magnetic field may create auroras like
<ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s northern lights, and also may trap orbiting radiation belts
similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s Van <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> belts.
   Today's course correction was designed to assure Voyager can aim
a radio signal at <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> when the probe starts to pass behind <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   By measuring changes in the signal, scientists hope to determine
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s atmospheric pressures, temperatures and chemical makeup;
whether ring arcs are made of dust, sand, pebbles or boulders; and
how material is distributed inside <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   After the encounter, Voyager II like its sister craft will
continue on its way out of the solar system. It will continue to
send data back to earth until its fuel runs out in 28 years.

   From 3.8 billion miles, the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> is a blue dot
in an ocean of black.
   ``On that blue dot, that's where everyone you know, everyone you
ever heard of, every human being who ever lived, lived out their
life,'' astronomer <PERSON>Carl Sagan</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> as <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> released an
extraordinary photo taken from a vantage point in deep space.
   Voyager 1, speeding toward the edge of the solar system, looked
back in <DATE>February</DATE> and snapped photos of six of the nine planets that
whirl around the sun.
   The photograph, actually a mosaic of 64 images taken in a
four-hour period, was the last from the spacecraft. The pictures
were recorded <DATE>Feb. 13-14</DATE> but were not played back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> until
late <DATE>March</DATE> because deep-space radio receivers were occupied with
higher priority tasks.
   The camera looked down from 32 degrees above the ecliptic plane _
the track in which most of the planets orbit the sun. It captured
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, Uranus, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   Mars was washed out by the sun, <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION> was too close to the sun
to be photographed and <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION> was too far away and too small to
appear. By happenstance, <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> was within a band of sunlight but
<PERSON>Sagan</PERSON> said it had no special significance.
   The twin spacecraft, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, were launched in
<DATE>August</DATE> and <DATE>September 1977</DATE> from <LOCATION>Cape Canaveral</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>. Between them,
they explored all the giant outer planets of the solar system, 48 of
their moons and the systems of rings and magnetic fields of those
planets.
   <ORGANIZATION>Edward Stone of the California Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>, chief
scientist on the Voyager project, said he expected the Voyagers to
leave the solar system and cruise into interstellar space sometime
between the years <DATE>2000</DATE> and <DATE>2010</DATE>. Voyager 1 is heading outward at a
rate of nearly a million miles a day.
   Sagan was asked what had been learned from the Voyagers that
would change descriptions of the solar system published in
encyclopedias in <DATE>1975</DATE>.
   ``I would say you would simply tear them up,'' he replied. The
knowledge gained from the space probes ``have wholly changed our
knowledge of the solar system.''
   Stone said the greatest discovery was that Io, a moon circling
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, had active volcanoes _ the first such discovery on another
body in the solar system. The Voyagers together observed nine
volcanic eruptions on Io.
   He showed reporters time-lapse pictures that showed graphically
that other storms meld into <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot, and that
storms circle the planet moving in opposite directions.
   Voyager showed that Uranus, a planet tipped on its side, also has
a previously undiscovered magnetic field that is tilted 60 degrees
from the planet's axis of rotation.
   Sagan recalled that the first successful planetary mission
occurred when Mariner 2 flew past Venus in <DATE>1962</DATE>.
   ``In 27 years the human species has flown close by or landed on
every planet in the solar system except <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>,'' he said. Still,
``we have no evidence, not a smidgen of evidence, suggesting life
anywhere else.''

   Neptune's poles may be encircled by broad
bands of dark clouds blown by jet streams like those on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, say scientists studying a new photograph from the Voyager 2
space probe.
   Two dark bands, each about 2,700 miles wide, are clearly visible
forming a collar around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s south pole. The photograph also
shows hints of similar banding around the north pole, said <PERSON>Edward
Stone</PERSON>, Voyager project scientist for <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   ``They are probably regions of clouds associated with high-speed
jet streams,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION>, a physicist and vice president at the
<ORGANIZATION>California Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>.
   The planet's southern hemisphere bands stretch from 50 degrees
south latitude to 70 degrees south latitude, said <PERSON>Candice Hansen</PERSON>, a
planetary scientist at <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION>.
   The new photograph was taken by Voyager 2 on <DATE>June 22</DATE> when it was
57.2 million miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>. Because of the time needed to
process an enhanced color image, it was released <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> by the
<ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>, which called it ``the
best color photo of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> taken so far by the Voyager 2
spacecraft.''
   Today, the spacecraft was 44.6 million miles from the remote
planet, cruising at 42,202 mph as it headed for its <DATE>Aug. 24</DATE> close
encounter with the solar system's fourth-largest planet.
   Voyager was 2.67 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, but has traveled 4.38
billion miles along its curving path since it was launched 12 years
ago.
   The photograph shows in greater detail a large dark spot _ a
cloud system bigger than the entire planet Mars _ seen in earlier
images of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>. Scientists have said the 6,200-mile-wide spot
probably is a storm similar to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot or <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s
hurricanes.
   Earth's jet streams are 65- to 200-mph high-altitude air currents
that zigzag across various latitudes as they blow around the globe.
The cloud bands on <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and apparently on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> are
straight belts encircling those planets. Uranus also shows faint
hints of narrower cloud bands.
   Scientists believe <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s jet streams meander across latitudinal
lines because of interference from continents and temperature
differences in the oceans.
   It may be that the bands are straight on the giant planets
because those worlds have extremely thick atmospheres with
relatively simple wind patterns, said <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> and Caltech planetary
scientist <PERSON>Andrew Ingersoll</PERSON>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s 250-mph jet streams are found along the edges of its
cloud bands, and scientists suspect the same is true on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said. There is no obvious association between jet streams and
cloud bands on <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, he added.
   Stone said that on <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, and possibly <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, the cloud bands
help create the jet streams and then are blown by them. <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s
clouds are pushed to high altitudes by winds stirred up by heat
within the planet. They try to fall back to lower elevations by
moving north or south. But the planet's rotation deflects the
falling clouds to form jet streams, he said.
   Voyager is still too far from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> to determine if the bands
contain dark high-altitude clouds or if they are broad ribbons of
clear sky that allow Voyager to peer at dark clouds lower in
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s atmosphere, said <PERSON>Rich Terrile</PERSON>, a Jet Propulsion Laboratory
astronomer.
   Studying <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s atmosphere will give scientists ``an
understanding of the circulation pattern on a planet at one of the
most remote fringes of our solar system,'' <PERSON>Terrile</PERSON> said, adding that
knowledge of alien atmospheres ``improves our ability to understand
our own atmosphere.''
   Voyager 2 and its twin, Voyager 1, were launched from <LOCATION>Cape
Canaveral</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1977</DATE>.
   They explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>. Voyager 1 flew past <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE>
and is headed toward interstellar space. Voyager 2 encountered
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE>, Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE> and will fly about 3,000 miles above
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s north pole cloudtops at <TIME>9 p.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Aug. 24</DATE>.
   Five hours later it will encounter <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s backward-orbiting
moon, <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, at a distance of about 25,000 miles.
   Neptune usually is the eighth planet from the sun, but because of
<LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>'s elongated orbit <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> will be the ninth and outermost
until <DATE>2007</DATE>.

   Voyager 2 plunged over <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s north
pole and <DATE>today</DATE> took its closest look at the moon <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, discovering
dormant ice-spewing volcanoes and snapping photos of cliffs, faults
and glacier-like lunar terrain as the spacecraft capped its epic
exploration of four planets.
   ``This is it _ we are exploring new worlds!'' laboratory
astronomer <PERSON>Rich Terrile</PERSON> said after the 12-year-old spaceship made
its historic rendezvous with the outermost planet. Neptune ``is not
a gee-whiz, science-fiction, special effects movie. It's a real
place.''
   The one-ton Voyager probe skimmed 3,048 miles above <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s icy
north pole cloud tops at <TIME>8:56 p.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Thursday</DATE> _ the closest of its
planetary encounters _ after being accelerated by <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s gravity
to a speed of 61,148 mph.
   Its photos of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> revealed that <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s major moon has
large, inactive volcanic craters, called calderas, ``filled with ice
instead of rock. The lava flow is a flow of ice, not of rock,'' said
Voyager project scientist Ed Stone.
   ``It's the first time we've seen an icy volcano,'' although
volcanic ice flows without associated craters were detected on a
moon of Uranus, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said. ``This is a real volcano.''
   ``We are witness today to truly an amazing feat of American space
technology,'' Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON> said <DATE>today</DATE> in a speech to
hundreds of scientists and dignitaries at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Reiterating President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s <DATE>July</DATE> statement in support of an
eventual permanent base on the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s moon and a manned trip to
<ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> declared: ``We Americans have been opening new
frontiers throughout our history and we will continue to do so.
Today, space is <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s frontier.''
   <PERSON>Lennard Fisk</PERSON>, an associate administrator of the <ORGANIZATION>National
Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>, called the climax of the
Voyager mission historic because ``it's the last time we're seeing a
planet for the first time. We've completed the reconnaissance of the
planets, except <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>.''
   Five hours after the rendezvous with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, the spaceship made
its closest pass by the moon <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> at <TIME>2:10 a.m.</TIME>, a flyby that was
confirmed when signals reached <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> at <TIME>6:16 a.m. PDT</TIME>.
   The four hour and six minute delay is the time it takes Voyager's
radio signal to travel the 2.75 billion miles to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The array of information on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s largest moon had
scientists, if anything, more excited than they were about <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
itself.
   ``<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> will upstage <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>. It's filled with hummocky,
rippling terrain,'' <PERSON>Terrile</PERSON> said.
   ``It looks like there's all kinds of fault systems all over the
place,'' said <PERSON>Laurence Soderblom</PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION>. The
faults suggest that ``Triton quakes'' may have occurred at one time
on the moon.
   Later, <PERSON>Joseph Boyce</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> geologist, said there was ``abundant
evidence of ice volcanism'' in the latest pictures. He referred to
volcanoes that once spewed frozen natural gas or other ice-like
substance rather than molten rock.
   Voyager's newest photos of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> received <TIME>this morning</TIME> showed a
smooth feature, looking somewhat like a dry lakebed, that <PERSON>Boyce</PERSON> said
measured several hundred miles across.
   ``It looked like it could be a ... crater of a volcano itself,''
<PERSON>Boyce</PERSON> said. ``It looks like some sort of feature flooded by
material, and the material is probably volcanic material.''
   The Voyager mission found similar evidence of icy volcanic flows
on Uranus' moon <PERSON>Ariel</PERSON> in <DATE>1986</DATE>, and earlier found active
sulfur-spewing volcanoes on Io, a moon of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Boyce</PERSON> emphasized there is no evidence yet that <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s icy
volcanism is currently active, but said the smooth floor of the
crater, unmarked by meteorite impact craters, indicates that the ice
volcano may have been active within the last million years or so.
   Earlier, <PERSON>Bradford Smith</PERSON>, head of Voyager's photographic imaging
team at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, had described <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s
surface in photos taken <DATE>Thursday</DATE> as ``extremely strange and
puzzling.''
   The photos showed long fault lines, ridges, low-lying cliffs and
``ice structures of various sorts, like glacier terrain,'' scientist
<PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON> said.
   While difficult to interpret, the early photos of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> gave
``the same impression as if you stepped out onto some strange and
alien surface,'' with what appears to be a blue, pink and white
topography that is ``closer to flat than big mountains,'' said
<PERSON>Smith</PERSON>, who called the pictures ``Just short of spectacular.''
   At <TIME>11:59 p.m. PDT</TIME>, signals were received showing that Voyager had
been bombarded by dust particles up to 100 times a second as it
passed through the plane containing <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s rings, said <PERSON>Donald
Gurnett</PERSON>. The particles, each about a millionth of a yard across _
the size of the particles in cigarette smoke _ did not damage the
spacecraft, <PERSON>Gurnett</PERSON> said.
   Voyager's safe progress through the ring plane prompted
scientists to toast each other with champagne even before the
spaceship's near encounter with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said.
   ``There's certainly euphoria,'' he said. ``We are all very
excited.''
   Scientists announced <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that Voyager discovered two more
tiny moons orbiting the solar system's fourth-largest planet: a
60-mile-wide moon designated <DATE>1989</DATE> N5, and the even smaller <DATE>1989</DATE> N6,
which is a mere 30 miles wide.
   That brought the number of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s moons discovered before the
close encounter to eight, including the two moons detected from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> _ <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> and Nereid _ and four found earlier by Voyager.
   Voyager also found a complete ring of debris encircling <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>,
although it was at first thought to be a partial ring or ring arc.
Voyager photos also indicated a ring arc orbiting farther from
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> almost certainly also is a complete ring.
   During its flight past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, Voyager was programmed
to shoot radio waves through the atmospheres of both worlds to study
their atmospheres; measure changes in distant starlight to study the
rings and search for others; and take its best but still
2.9-million-mile-distant pictures of Nereid.
   Voyager's hectic schedule also included numerous measurements of
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s atmosphere in an effort to understand its 400-mph winds,
high-altitude clouds, and its Earth-sized Great Dark Spot and other
cyclones.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> calculated <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s position during the <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> flyby as
nearly 2.75 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. But the ship had traveled a
curving path totaling 4.43 billion miles since it was launched in
<DATE>1977</DATE>, and explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in
<DATE>1986</DATE>.
   Champagne flowed at the laboratory <DATE>Thursday</DATE> when Voyager crossed
the supersonic shock wave where the solar wind meets <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
magnetic field.
   Earlier pictures of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> suggested the backward-orbiting moon
had meteorite impact craters and possibly glaciers of frozen natural
gas on its pink-and-blue surface.
   Using occasional trajectory corrections and engineering wizardry
to aim a space probe built with <DATE>1960s</DATE> technology, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers
said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> they got Voyager to within 20 miles of where it was
supposed to be after the long journey.
   ``Not bad shooting,'' said one engineer.
   Voyager 1 visited <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE>, and now is
speeding toward interstellar space _ just as Voyager 2 will do after
it stops studying <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> on <DATE>Oct. 2</DATE>.
   Neptune usually is the eighth planet from the sun, but <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>'s
elliptical orbit means it now is closer, making <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> temporarily
the solar system's outmost planet.
   ``Someday there ought to be a <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION> flyby,'' <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON> said. ``But
there are no active plans to do that.''

   The <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spaceship swooped past Venus
early <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, and the cloud-shrouded planet acted as a gravity
slingshot to help hurl the craft toward its <DATE>1995</DATE> rendezvous with
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Engineers at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory received a radio
signal confirming that the 2.8-ton spacecraft made its closest
approach to Venus at <TIME>12:59 a.m. EST</TIME>, cruising 10,028 miles above
the planet's hellishly hot surface.
   ``We have just flown through our closest approach point to
Venus,'' said <PERSON>Bill O'Neil</PERSON>, science and mission design manager.
``The greatest challenge of getting <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> has been
met.''
   Four hours before the close encounter, radio signals received on
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> confirmed the spacecraft computer ordered <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s infrared
light sensor to start observing <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>. The instrument was looking
for the glow of the hot lower atmosphere backlighting cooler clouds
overhead, <PERSON>O'Neil</PERSON> said.
   That started an eight-hour period of intensive photography and
measurements, including a photographic search for lightning.
Earlier <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> studied dust particles and magnetic fields
in space, and measured Venusian atmospheric temperatures.
   ``The Venus encounter is our first major milestone in the
mission,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> project scientist <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>. ``After
the encounter, we have gained enough energy out of this celestial
billiard shot to get the energy we need to make it all the way to
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.''
   The power the spacecraft gains in the flyby is triple the energy
of its propellant supply, said mission director <PERSON>Neal Ausman</PERSON>.
   The <MONEY>$1.35 billion</MONEY> mission will let <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> examine <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, its
moon and one or two asteroids before the spacecraft separates into
an orbiter and a small probe in <DATE>July 1995</DATE>. In <DATE>December 1995</DATE>, they
arrive at <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the solar system's largest planet, after a
2.4-billion-mile trip, including 182 million miles to reach <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was deployed from the space shuttle Atlantis last <DATE>Oct.
18</DATE>.
   Venus circles the sun between the orbits of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION>,
the closest planet to the sun. Acid-laden clouds extend 40 miles
above the surface, trapping heat in a runaway ``greenhouse effect''
that raised surface temperatures to 900 degrees Fahrenheit.
Atmospheric pressure is 90 times that on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Venus is about <PERCENT>95
percent</PERCENT> as wide as <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Scientists suspect it may have active
volcanoes and shifting plates on its crust.
   The Venus flyby was designed purely to give <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> a boost for
its trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> by increasing its speed from 83,750 mph to
88,740 mph. In two other ``gravity assist'' maneuvers, the
spacecraft will use the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> as a slingshot next <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE> and again
on <DATE>Dec. 8, 1992</DATE>, so it will be properly aimed toward <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>,
<PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said.
   Scientists decided to take advantage of the Venus encounter by
having <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s camera and instruments make photographs and
measurements of Venus starting <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> and continuing for a
week.
   But almost all the pictures and data _ stored on three tracks of
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s four-track tape recorder _ won't be sent back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
until <DATE>October</DATE>, when the spacecraft is close enough to transmit the
material with its low-gain antenna. That antenna now can be used
only for communications to keep <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> operating.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s main umbrella-shaped antenna must remain furled to
protect it from sunlight until after the craft makes its first
flight past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was programmed to photograph <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and study the planet
with its ultraviolet, infrared and visible light sensors to look
for lightning, study the makeup of the carbon dioxide atmosphere,
examine cloud and wind patterns, map cloudtop temperatures and peer
at the lower atmosphere.
   Sensors that detect particles and magnetic fields were
programmed to study how solar wind interacts with <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>'
atmosphere. At the same time, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> arranged for the <ORGANIZATION>Pioneer Venus
Orbiter</ORGANIZATION>, circling <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> since <DATE>1978</DATE>, to make similar measurements
closer to the planet, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   While nearly 20 other <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Soviet spacecraft have visited
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, ``we think we're going to get some real good stuff,'' he
said.
   But scientists won't know for months unless engineers meet
success next week when they try to have <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> send back a small
amount of data, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> added.
   Studies from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and previous spacecraft indicate <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> has
continent-sized highlands with peaks dwarfing <LOCATION>Mount Everest</LOCATION> and
hundreds of thousands of volcanoes stretching across lowland plains.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft, launched from <LOCATION>Atlantis</LOCATION> <DATE>last May 4</DATE>,
will go into orbit around Venus in <DATE>August</DATE>. It will use radar to
peer through the clouds and map at least <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>'
surface during a <MONEY>$550 million</MONEY> mission.
   When the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe and orbiter reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the probe will
parachute into the atmosphere and make measurements until intense
heat and pressure vaporize it. The orbiter will photograph and
study <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and its major moons until late <DATE>1997</DATE>, circling the
planet instead of flying past it like the Pioneer and Voyager
spacecraft.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> originally
planned to send <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> on a two-year trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> by launching
it with a <ORGANIZATION>Centaur</ORGANIZATION> rocket after it was released from a shuttle.
   But the <DATE>1986</DATE> explosion that destroyed Challenger and killed
seven crew members raised safety concerns. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> decided against
using the volatile, liquid-fueled Centaur.
   So <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was launched with a much weaker <ORGANIZATION>Inertial Upper Stage</ORGANIZATION>
booster after it was deployed by Atlantis' crew. The weaker rocket
required <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> to redesign <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s route so the craft could
utilize gravity from <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and Earth for a much longer, looping
trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Environmentalists failed in court to stop <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> from having a
shuttle carry <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> into space. They feared a Challenger-like
explosion could contaminate <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> with plutonium in <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s
nuclear batteries, which are not reactors but generate electricity
using heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said the
risk was minimal.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is named for the Italian Renaissance astronomer who
discovered <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s major moons.

<TEXT>
   The shuttle Atlantis is set to soar
into space <DATE>Friday</DATE> to rekindle an American planetary exploration
program that has languished for a decade because of budget cuts and
the Challenger accident.
   The cargo is the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft which has a radar system
powerful enough to pierce the dense sulfuric acid clouds of Venus
and map its surface. The mission costs <MONEY>$550 million</MONEY> and the radar
images could reveal much about the history of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and the
evolution of our own <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Liftoff is scheduled for <TIME>2:24 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE>, and six hours later,
<PERSON>Atlantis</PERSON>' five astronauts are to release <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> on the start of a
466-day outward journey to the mysterious planet.
   No American planetary spacecraft has been launched since the
Pioneer-Venus probe in <DATE>1978</DATE>, and <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will be the first
planet-bound vehicle to be dispatched from the space shuttle.
   When the 7,000-pound payload reaches <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> in <DATE>August 1990</DATE>, it is
to fire into orbit and start its 243-day mapping assignment.
   ``The goal is to obtain radar images of at least <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of
the planet,'' said <PERSON>Stephen Saunders</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project scientist at
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.
   He said the images could help scientists understand how Venus
was formed and might provide an answer to the puzzling question of
how Earth and <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, evolved so differently even though at the
beginning of the solar system they were almost identical. At the
Venusian surface, the temperature is 900 degrees Fahrenheit and the
atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than that on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> pictures might answer questions about
the extent of volcanic activity and settle disputes over whether
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON> once had oceans of water and whether it has shifting crustal
plates similar to those on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The radar is designed to produce images showing features as
small as 150 yards across. In comparison, the <DATE>1978</DATE> Pioneer-Venus
probe could not distinguish features smaller than 60 miles across.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is the first of two planetary craft scheduled for
launching from <LOCATION>Atlantis</LOCATION> this year. The <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> is
to set forth in <DATE>October</DATE>.
   The two spacecraft have been in development for more than a
decade. They initially were delayed by budget cuts resulting from a
slowdown in the space program after the completion of the Apollo
man-to-the-moon program.
   They finally were assigned to shuttle missions set for liftoff
in <DATE>1986</DATE>. But those flights were derailed after Challenger exploded
in <DATE>January 1986</DATE>, grounding the shuttle fleet for nearly three years.
   ``It's been a long time coming,'' <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said.
   The first manmade spacecraft to probe another planet was
<LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>'s Venera 1, which scouted Venus in <DATE>1961</DATE>. In the years that
followed, a parade of these vehicles, each more sophisticated than
the last, pushed deep into the solar system to take the pulse of
our planetary neighbors.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has successfully sent five probes to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>,
six to <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION>, four to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, three to <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, and one each to
<ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus. And in <DATE>August</DATE>, the long-traveling Voyager 2 is
to take the first closeup look at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   The <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> has sent 19 successful spacecraft to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and
nine to Mars. Its most recent and most ambitious probes both failed
_ Phobos 1 <DATE>last September</DATE> while en route to Mars and Phobos 2 as it
was starting its exploration from Martian orbit last month.
   Soviet engineers have not perfected the long-term
nuclear-powered batteries needed to travel to the outer planets.
The Soviet craft employ solar panels which draw electrical power
from the sun. But at distant <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and Uranus,
these panels would be too far from the sun to be effective.
   At their destinations, some of these robot marvels skim close,
snapping pictures and gathering a few days of data before soaring
on to another planet or into interstellar space; some orbit their
targets to examine them at length, and some descend to the surface.
   What they collect is flashed as binary bits to Earth-bound
computers, which translate the unknown into recognizable places
filled with surprises and secrets. Vague speculations of the past
have been replaced by solid scientific findings.
   Humans have caught their first views and hints of the great
storm systems and rings of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>; the active volcanoes on its
salt-covered moon, Io; the parched and cratered wasteland of
Mercury; ancient river bottoms, raging winds and an inactive
volcanoe almost 80,000 feet high on Mars; sulfuric acid clouds,
lightning and the hellish temperatures on Venus; the thousand rings
and tantalizing moons of <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>; a scalding 6,000-mile deep ocean
beneath the cloudtops of Uranus.
   From these flights, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> is assembling a vast mosaic about the
solar system and its intricate workings. A basic goal is to learn
more about planet <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, fitting it into the cosmic puzzle that is
the origin, the evolution and the structure of the universe.
   Some astronomers believe, for example, that Mars may today
represent an earlier evolutionary state of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> when its
atmosphere was being formed, and that <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> may represent what
might happen to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> if its surface temperature were to rise
significantly.

   Twelve years, three planets and 4.4
billion miles after leaving <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, Voyager 2 is converging on
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, a swirling, blue-green planet with a backward moon, for the
last stop on an extraordinary tour.
   ``The solar system is our neighborhood, and we're getting to the
end of the neighborhood,'' said <PERSON>Norm Haynes</PERSON>, Voyager project manager
at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Admnistration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Voyager 2 already has detected a dark spot on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> that may be
a giant storm like <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot. As it nears the planet,
the probe will search for undiscovered moons and partial rings. And
at <TIME>9 p.m. PDT</TIME> on <DATE>Aug. 24</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will swoop within 3,000 miles of
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s north pole cloudtops _ the closest of its close encounters
and the first spacecraft to visit the planet.
   It will be 2.75 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> after traveling 4.43
billion miles along its curving path. The information it sends back
at the speed of light will take four hours and six minutes to arrive.
   Five hours after the closest encounter, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will fly within
25,000 miles of the backwards-orbiting moon, <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>. The other known
moon is Nereid.
   Voyager 1 and 2, laden with TV cameras and an array of sensors,
were launched from <LOCATION>Cape Canaveral</LOCATION> in <DATE>1977</DATE>. They visited <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>1979</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE> and <DATE>1981</DATE>, respectively. Voyager 2 reached
Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>. Voyager 1 now is heading toward interstellar space.
   Voyager 1 and 2 returned 65,000 photographs of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>
and their moons and rings. Voyager 2 sent back 8,000 pictures of
Uranus and its moons, and will take another 8,000 of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   At a cost <PERSON>Haynes</PERSON> pegged at <MONEY>$865 million</MONEY> through the <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
encounter, the Voyagers ``returned more new knowledge about the
outer planets ... than existed in all of the preceding history of
astronomy,'' according to <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, discovered in <DATE>1846</DATE>, is 30,700 miles in diameter _ six
times <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s size and the fourth largest planet after <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus. A Neptunian year lasts 165 Earth years, and a day
lasts 17 to 18 Earth hours _ a detail Voyager may pinpoint. Neptune
usually is the eighth planet, but because of <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>'s elongated orbit
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> will be the ninth and outermost until <DATE>2007</DATE>.
   Scientists expect Voyager to discover at least 10 small moons,
said deputy project scientist <PERSON>Ellis Miner</PERSON>.
   Some moons may confine or shepherd the 5- to 12-mile-wide
incomplete rings, called ``ring arcs,'' orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, said
physicist Ed Stone, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Voyager project scientist and a vice
president at <ORGANIZATION>California Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>.
   Voyager also may discover dust bands and 50 to 100 partial rings
in addition to the three to six arcs scientists believe they
detected from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, Stone added. The partial rings, possibly made
of dust and pebbles, most likely are debris from the collision of a
comet and an ancient moon, he said.
   Voyager should be some 33,400 miles above <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s clouds when
it crosses the ring region, so it is unlikely to be destroyed by an
unseen arc, he said.
   The probe also will study <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s weather. Scientists believe
the 6,200-mile-wide dark spot it found probably is similar to
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s hurricanes or <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot. The source of the
internal heat driving <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s storms is a mystery; Earth's comes
decaying radioactive material in rocks.
   Neptune is pale blue-green because methane, or natural gas, in
its mostly hydrogen-helium atmosphere absorbs red light. Scientists
suspect that a third of the way toward the planet's center the
atmosphere becomes a superhot slurry of hot water and rock, so
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> _ like neighboring Uranus _ probably lacks a distinct
sky-sea boundary, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Despite any internal heat, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> receives 900 times less
sunlight than <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, so the temperature at the top of its atmosphere
is 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, about the same as on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Scientists believe <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> _ 1,400 to 2,240 miles wide, roughly
the size of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s moon _ will be the most fascinating part of
Voyager's flyby.
   When a planet and its moons form from a spinning disk of gas and
solid material, the moons should orbit in the direction the planet
rotates. <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s reverse orbit suggests it once orbited the sun
like a comet or a planet but collided with a moon to form a new
backwards-moving satellite, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> probably is cold and geologically inactive, with an icy
mantle over a rocky core. But it once may have had a molten interior
that created ridges, valleys, cliffs, canyons and volcanoes that
Voyager might photograph.
   Observations from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> indicate <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere contains
methane and nitrogen. Sunlight likely converts methane into complex
hydrocarbons, creating a transparent reddish-orange photochemical
haze, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said. The hydrocarbons may form heavier particles,
coating the surface with frozen sludge.
   Could the organic chemicals have allowed life to develop on
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>?
   ``The temperature is very, very cold, so I think it's unlikely,''
he said.
   Scientists believe <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> has extreme seasons because its orbit
around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> is highly inclined: One pole faces the sun for 82
years and the other remains in darkness. This may mean <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s
atmosphere gets thinner and thicker as methane-nitrogen icecaps
cover one pole, then the other.
   Researchers discarded the theory that <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> has liquid nitrogen
oceans, but puddles or lakes are possible, along with fields of
nitrogen ice crystals, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Nereid, about 190 to 620 miles wide, has a very elongated
elliptical orbit. Caltech astrophysicist <PERSON>Peter Goldreich</PERSON> speculates
Nereid once had a circular orbit that was disturbed by gravity from
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> or a large passing object.
   If Voyager confirms that <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> has a magnetic field, the planet
also may have an aurora like <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s, and a mysterious ultraviolet
``electroglow.'' A magnetic field should trap a radiation belt
around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s Van <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> belts. <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s
radiation belts damaged some of Voyager's equipment; <PERSON>Haynes</PERSON> doubts
similar problems at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   Voyager 2 has worked 12 years with only relatively minor
failures, although it contains electronics equal to 10,000
television sets, he said.
   Commands sent to <LOCATION>Voyager</LOCATION>, and photos and information it sends to
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, travel at the speed of light. But the one-way trip still take
four hours, six minutes. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> is using 38 dish-shaped radio antennas
in <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to capture the
radio signal, which is like trying to see a 20-watt light bulb
burning 2.75 billion miles away.
   ``Both Voyagers are expected to return valuable data well into
the 21st century'' before their power supplies run out in about
<DATE>2020</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   After <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, Voyager 2 will join Voyager 1 and Pioneers 10 and
11 in seeking the true edge of the solar system, where solar wind
gives way to interstellar wind billions of miles beyond the planets.

<HEAD>More Active Volcanoes Found on Triton; Neptune Has 1,500 mph Winds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Up to four more active ice volcanoes on
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s moon <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> were discovered in snapshots taken by Voyager
2, which found the planet itself is swept by 1,500 mph winds _ the
fastest yet seen in the solar system.
   Because the spacecraft photographed at least two and possibly
five of the geyser-like volcanoes erupting on only a portion of
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, ``chances are that there are a dozen of these things going
off globally'' at any time, said <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>, a planetary
scientist at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>.
   Confirmation of the first active volcano was announced <DATE>Oct. 2</DATE>
after scientists analyzed photos Voyager 2 snapped during its <DATE>Aug.
24-25</DATE> flight past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>.
   Detection of more such volcanoes _ which spew nitrogen ice and
gas 5 miles high and 90 miles downwind _ was announced <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>
during a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION>American Geophysical Union</ORGANIZATION>'s fall
meeting.
   <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> is only the third world in the solar system known to have
active volcanism. The others are Earth and <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s moon Io, which
has sulfur-spewing volcanoes. Scientists suspect there are
volcanoes on cloud-shrouded Venus.
   <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s jet-stream winds push frozen clouds of natural gas
past the north edge of the planet's Earth-size, hurricane-like
Great Dark Spot at nearly 1,500 mph, Voyager project scientist
<ORGANIZATION>Edward Stone</ORGANIZATION> told reporters. That's about the speed of sound in
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s atmosphere.
   ``These are the fastest we've observed,'' easily exceeding the
previous record winds of 1,100 mph in <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>'s jet stream, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION>
said. ``These almost may be supersonic winds ... a wind which is
Mach 1.''
   The speed of sound on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> is about 700 mph, depending on
temperature and altitude. It's much faster on planets with colder
atmospheres containing gases lighter than those in <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s air.
   The clouds racing in <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s winds could be seen in a movie
made by computer from still photographs taken by Voyager. Also
shown at <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s news conference was another computer movie
clearly showing two of the dark volcanic plumes on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>,
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s largest moon and the coldest known object in the solar
system.
   The plumes rise like columns, each forming a cloud that drifts
back and forth as it is blown downwind. A shadow cast by one cloud
also is visible.
   The movie also shows what scientists suspect are two or three
more plumes, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   When Voyager swept past <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> early <DATE>Aug. 25</DATE>, scientists saw
streaks on dark material deposited on the moon's surface by what
they believed were active nitrogen-ice volcanoes.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> announced it
was sure there was one active volcano after conducting stereoscopic
analysis of the photos.
   But the images were so fuzzy ``you had to take our word for
it,'' <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   So <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> used a computer to overlap still photos taken from
different angles and replay them in sequence repeatedly. The
resulting movie revealed additional volcanic plumes.
   The causes of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s nitrogen ice volcanoes and <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s high
winds are mysterious.
   Stone described one theory on the volcanoes: Darker material
settles on the moon's surface, then is covered by transparent
nitrogen ice. Sunlight penetrates the ice, and warms the darker
material beneath. But the heat cannot escape through the ice, so
some of the buried ice melts into gas, causing pressure to build
until the gas erupts upward through cracks, carrying ice and dark
material with it.
   Neptune gets 900 times less sunlight than <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Scientists are
perplexed about how the internal heat left over from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
formation is enough to drive 700-mph winds in the Great Dark Spot,
not to mention the 1,500-mph jet stream winds blowing between 15
and 20 degrees south latitude, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Part of the explanation may be that the flow of fluid gases in
the planet's atmosphere may be so smooth that little energy is
needed to power high winds, he said.
   Voyager 2's Neptune-Triton exploration capped a 12-year mission
in which it flew past <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus. The spacecraft
discovered six moons at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, bringing the total to eight, and
found several rings of debris orbiting the planet, which is 30
times farther from the sun than <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.

   Voyager's pictures of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s moon
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> _ which revealed a unique world of icy volcanoes _ might have
been washed out if not for last-minute adjustments to the
spacecraft's cameras, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> says.
   ``It wouldn't have wiped out the mission, but would have made a
lot of photographs embarrassingly overexposed,'' said <PERSON>Rich Terrile</PERSON>,
an astronomer at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s
Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``It would have been an incredible
disappointment.''
   ``They would have been white images,'' Voyager project scientist
<ORGANIZATION>Edward Stone</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   Meanwhile, scientists said the spacecraft found that <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> is
the coldest body ever measured in the solar system, and that <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
has something in common with <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>: smog.
   Only days before Voyager made its closest approach to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
<DATE>last Thursday</DATE> and zipped past <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, scientists
recognized that the frosty surface of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s largest moon
reflected much more light than originally expected, said <PERSON>Mary Beth
Murrill</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman.
   Engineers compensated by sending Voyager new computer commands
reducing the exposure time on its television cameras from 6.68
seconds to 3.84 seconds for the best close-ups of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Murrill</PERSON>
said.
   Those photographs revealed that giant craters, called calderas,
once oozed an icy form of lava that flooded thousands of square
miles of lunar terrain. They also found what scientists believe are
active ice volcanoes that explosively propel frozen nitrogen
particles 20 miles skyward.
   During its <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> encounter, Voyager's cameras discovered six
moons in addition to <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Nereid</LOCATION>, which were discovered from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. They also found three thin rings of debris and five broad
rings encircling the solar system's fourth-largest planet.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers are investigating the feasibility of reprogramming
Voyager to take a snapshot of the entire solar system sometime in
the coming months, said <PERSON>Lanny Miller</PERSON>, manager of the flight
engineering office.
   By <TIME>9 p.m. PDT tonight</TIME>, Voyager will be 2.76 billion miles from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 4.55 million miles behind <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, speeding toward the
edge of the solar system at 37,568 mph.
   Voyager 2's ultraviolet detector determined <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s surface
temperature is 400 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, making the moon
``the coldest body we have seen in the solar system,'' said <PERSON>Roger
Yelle</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Arizona</ORGANIZATION>.
   Scientists believe <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION> and its moon <PERSON>Charon</PERSON> are the
second-coldest bodies in the solar system.
   Voyager also found smog on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   Sunlight hitting natural gas, or methane, high in the planet's
atmosphere converts it into a 90-mile-thick icy layer of
photochemical smog at the bottom of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s stratosphere, said <PERSON>Jim
Pollock</PERSON>, an imaging team member from <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Ames Research Center</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Mountain View</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.
   ``Photochemical smog exists any place we've been that has an
atmosphere,'' imaging team leader <PERSON>Bradford Smith</PERSON> said of other
planets and moons.
   ``In <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, the problem is it's happening way down low
where we have to breathe it in amounts exceeding anything we've seen
except on Titan,'' he said, referring to <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>'s smoggy moon.
   In another finding, the best close-up shot of the Neptunian moon
<DATE>1989</DATE> N1 showed it has a huge crater half the width of its
lumpy-looking, 240-mile-wide surface.
   That indicates that a big meteorite once smacked into <DATE>1989</DATE> N1,
one of the six moons discovered by Voyager since <DATE>June</DATE>, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said.
   Voyager found earlier that <DATE>1989</DATE> N1 really is <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
second-largest moon after <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>. Scientists previously thought
Nereid was No. 2.
   Instruments aboard Voyager discovered <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> is encircled by
electrically charged particles that form a giant doughnut shape,
called a torus.
   The torus is created by gases coming off of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON>Ralph
McNutt</PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>. Jupiter is
orbited by a similar torus of sulfur particles spewed by sulfur
volcanoes on the Jovian moon Io.
   The space probe also found <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> have auroras
vaguely like <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s northern and southern lights. They glow in
ultraviolet light wavelengths invisible to the human eye, however,
unlike <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s visible auroras.
   Voyager's close encounter with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> <DATE>last week</DATE> capped its epic
tour of the four outer planets, including <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and
Uranus. The probe was launched in <DATE>1977</DATE> along with its twin, Voyager
1, which explored only <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>.

   The <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft, racing toward a
close encounter with <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> next week so it can reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>1995</DATE>, will explore its home planet like an alien world, scientists
said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The camera-bearing planetary spacecraft will be the first to
approach Earth from space, so the <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE> flyby will be ``our first
chance to look at <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> as we have at other planets in the solar
system,'' <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s chief scientist, said during
a news conference.
   ``It gives humankind a vantage point to look at their world as
they've never seen it before,'' <PERSON>Bill O'Neil</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> project
manager at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION>, said earlier.
   Galileo is the most sophisticated planetary spacecraft ever
built. It was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>Oct. 18,
1989</DATE>, starting its <MONEY>$1.4 billion</MONEY>, 2.4 billion-mile journey to
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the solar system's largest planet.
   Starting in <DATE>December 1995</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> orbiter will spend two
years exploring <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and 10 of its moons after deploying a probe
that will make measurements in <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere until it is
crushed by intense pressure there.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s route was designed so the unmanned spacecraft could
use Venus and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> as ``gravity slingshots'' to expand its orbit
around the sun and reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. It will use Earth for that
purpose <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE> and again in <DATE>December 1992</DATE>. It used <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> as a
gravity slingshot last <DATE>February</DATE>.
   Scientists decided to take advantage of the close encounters to
make pictures and measurements of Venus and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Data collected
at <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> was stored on <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s tape recorder and sent to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
<DATE>last week</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s optical camera made detailed pictures of the uppermost
layer of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' sulfuric acid clouds, as did spacecraft that
visited Venus previously. But <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s infrared camera made the
first still pictures and a movie showing clouds moving in 150 mph
winds in <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' middle and lower cloud decks.
   Severe turbulence that may be caused by thunderstorms was
detected in the middle cloud layer, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> scientist <PERSON>Robert Carlson</PERSON>
said.
   Studying <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' acid clouds and its carbon dioxide atmosphere
may help scientists understand how increasing carbon dioxide levels
in <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere will warm the planet like glass traps heat in
a greenhouse, said <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> astronomer <PERSON>Michael Belton</PERSON>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> also discovered remarkably fast high-energy particles
flowing away from <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, a surprise because space around the planet
was thought to be placid, said <ORGANIZATION>University of Iowa</ORGANIZATION> physicist <ORGANIZATION>Louis
Frank</ORGANIZATION>.
   The spacecraft also recorded scratchy and screechy sounds
created by waves in electrically charged solar wind particles that
sweep around <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>. Scientists played the tape <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will swoop about 593 miles above the southwest <LOCATION>Atlantic
Ocean</LOCATION> at <TIME>3:35 p.m. EST</TIME> <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was 4.46 million miles from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The spacecraft will measure gases that cause ``greenhouse
effect'' warming of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere, and study high-altitude
water vapor that helps create and destroy <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s protective ozone
layer, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> also will be the first spacecraft with modern
instruments to study the far side of the moon, which is always
pointed away from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, he added.

<HEAD>Space Probe Flies By Venus on Jupiter Trip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> space probe, heading for <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>
on a six-year roundabout journey, will fly past the planet <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>
late <DATE>Friday</DATE> and early <DATE>Saturday</DATE> and gain momentum for the second leg
of the trip _ back toward <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, said
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will be 10,028 miles above <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' cloud tops when it makes
its closest approach at <TIME>9:59 p.m.</TIME> <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> time, <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   Although the space probe's instruments will be recording
information about Venus _ Earth's closest planetary neighbor _ the
data won't be played back for scientists until <DATE>October</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was launched last <DATE>October 18</DATE> from the cargo bay of the
space shuttle Atlantis. After passing <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and gaining slingshot
momentum from that flyby, the <MONEY>$1.5 billion</MONEY> probe loops back and
will come within 620 miles of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in <DATE>December</DATE>.
   With that added second push, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> once more will head out
into deep space and return in <DATE>1992</DATE>, coming as close as 200 miles of
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> before it starts out for <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> where it will arrive in
<DATE>December 1995</DATE>.
   There, a robot will separate from the main spacecraft and plunge
through the gaseous atmosphere of the solar system's largest
planet. Galileo itself will orbit the planet for two years taking
scientific measurements.
   Galileo carries a 49-pound nuclear generator to provide
electricity to power the craft's instruments. Similar generators
have been used on other deep space probes, including Voyager, which
last year sent back photographs as it passed <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, at that point
the planet farthest from the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.

   A robot explorer named Voyager 2 flies
past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> <DATE>this week</DATE> for its dazzling last picture show _ the
final photo opportunity during the spacecraft's four-planet, 4.4
billion-mile odyssey.
   ``We're getting close, everything is working extremely well and
we're all excited,'' said <PERSON>Norm Haynes</PERSON>, Voyager project manager at
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``The surf is definitely up here at <LOCATION>JPL</LOCATION>,'' joked <PERSON>Franklin
O'Donnell</PERSON>, a spokesman for the lab where about 170 scientists from
around the world are asembling for the critical period.
   Coincidentally, <DATE>Sunday</DATE> was the 12th anniversary of Voyager 2's
launch from <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 20, 1977</DATE>.
   The researchers will share ultimate exhilaration as front-row
observers for humanity's first close-up look at the solar system's
fourth-largest planet, a blue-green ball nearly four times <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s
diameter.
   But their excitement is tinged with nostalgia because Voyager's
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> encounter will be the last planetary flyby for a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
spacecraft. Future probes will orbit their target planets: <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
at <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and the Mars Observer.
   And with no one planning a mission to <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> is the last
unexplored planet that will be visited by a spacecraft from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in
the foreseeable future.
   ``It's almost like being on a ship of discovery like <PERSON>Marco Polo</PERSON>,
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Jurrie</PERSON> van der Woude, a <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> spokesman.
``For most of us, this is the last picture show, the last foreign
shores we visit in the solar system.''
   Only a few days and a few million miles remain until <TIME>8:59 p.m.
PDT</TIME> <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, when Voyager makes its closest approach to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> by
skirting 3,000 miles above the planet's cloudtops _ much closer than
its encounters with <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in
<DATE>1986</DATE>.
   As of <TIME>9 a.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Monday</DATE>, Voyager 2 will be 2.743 billion miles
from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 3.211 million miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, approaching the
planet at 42,310 mph. Since it was launched in <DATE>1977</DATE>, Voyager 2 has
traveled a curving path totaling 4.4 billion miles.
   With a final course correction <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers
will put Voyager 2 on its precise trajectory for the <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> flyby.
   Sending Voyager to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> was like ``sinking a 2,260-mile golf
putt, assuming the golfer can make a few illegal fine adjustments
while the ball is rolling across this incredibly long green,'' says
``The Voyager Neptune Travel Guide'' by mission planning manager
<PERSON>Charles Kohlhase</PERSON> and his staff.
   Up to 8,000 photographs from Voyager's two television cameras and
discoveries by 10 other science experiments will pour in so quickly
that the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> will conduct
daily news conferences starting <DATE>Monday</DATE> and continuing through <DATE>Aug.
29</DATE>.
   By late last week, Voyager had already revealed some of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
secrets, including:
   _Four previously unknown moons, in addition to <LOCATION>Nereid</LOCATION> and
backward-orbiting <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, which were discovered from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Voyager
is likely to discover more moons.
   _Clouds and other weather features, including 2,700-mile-wide
bands similar to jet streams on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, and a 8,100-by-4,100-mile
dark spot, probably a huge storm like <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot.
   _Two partial rings of debris, called ring arcs, that are much
different from the complete rings that encircle <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus.
Scientists say there may be 50 or more ring arcs orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   _A magnetic field surrounding <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, suggesting the planet also
may have auroras like <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s northern lights and may be enveloped
by orbiting radiation belts similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s Van <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> belts.
   The <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> encounter is the climax of the <MONEY>$865 million</MONEY>,
twin-spacecraft Voyager mission, which also saw Voyager 1 explore
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Haynes</PERSON> said <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s course correction will assure Voyager 2 can
aim a radio signal at <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> when the probe starts to pass behind
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Ellis Miner</PERSON>, deputy project scientist, said by measuring changes
in the signal, scientists hope to determine <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s atmospheric
pressures, temperatures and chemical makeup; whether ring arcs are
made of dust, sand, pebbles or boulders; and how material is
distributed inside <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   The radio experiment takes all of Voyager's radio signal
strength, so no other data or photographs will be sent back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
for about 2{ hours around the time of close encounter, <ORGANIZATION>Miner</ORGANIZATION> said.
When Voyager sends pictures and data to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, they take four hours
and six minutes to arrive, even traveling at the speed of light,
186,000 miles per second.
   During its closest encounter with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will pass over
the planet's north pole, which will be cloaked in winter darkness.
Six minutes later, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will start a 49-minute trip through
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s shadow. Instead of photographing <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> during those
times, the spacecraft will make other measurements and snap pictures
of any ring arcs and of one of the newly discovered moons.

   Voyager 2 cruised away from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and
toward the stars <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, completing an <MONEY>$865 million</MONEY> trek past 60
worlds, a triumphant exploration that might help humans prevent
destruction of their own planet.
   ``If you want to understand Earth, go look at other worlds,''
said <ORGANIZATION>Cornell University</ORGANIZATION> astronomer <PERSON>Carl Sagan</PERSON>, a member of the team
that analyzed about 81,000 photographs taken by Voyager 2 and its
twin, Voyager 1.
   ``Our passion to explore, our deep need to understand our
origins, and the very urgent and practical matter of safeguarding
our planet are all enormously enhanced by studying other planets.''
   As scientists held a final news conference at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet
Propulsion Laboratory to summarize Voyager 2's discoveries, the
one-ton spacecraft was 2.76 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 4.2 million
miles beyond <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, the solar system's fourth-largest and
currently most-distant planet.
   Voyager also was nearly 4.5 billion miles along a curving path
that took it from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in <DATE>1977</DATE>, past <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>, and now past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> in search of the edge
of the solar system. Voyager 1 explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>
in <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   For <MONEY>$865 million _ 20 cents</MONEY> per year per American since the
project started _ the twin Voyagers visited four planets with at
least 56 moons, discovering at least 23 of the satellites and
examining worlds of wonder, like <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s moon Io, with its
sulfur-spewing volcanoes.
   ``As exciting as the discoveries at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> have been, this
encounter has really just been the fourth and final planet that
<PERSON>Voyager</PERSON> has revealed in an unprecedented decade of discovery in its
journey through the outer solar system,'' said Voyager project
scientist <ORGANIZATION>Edward Stone</ORGANIZATION>. ``For those of us fortunate enough to be
involved, this has been the journey of a lifetime.''
   At <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, Voyager 2 discovered six moons in addition to <LOCATION>Nereid</LOCATION>
and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, which were first detected from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. It discovered
three thin rings of debris and two broad rings orbiting the planet.
It found at least six moonlets hidden in one of the rings.
   The spacecraft detected in <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s bluish atmosphere an
Earth-sized swirling storm called the Great Dark Spot, 720 mph
winds, photochemical smog, invisible ultraviolet auroras and cirrus
clouds of natural gas casting shadows on clouds far below.
   Voyager revealed two bizarre types of ice volcanoes on icy,
pinkish <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>. The first kind are calderas _ 1,000-foot-deep
craters measuring hundreds of miles across _ that produced
ocean-size floods of ice flowing like lava, probably no more
recently than <DATE>a half billion years ago</DATE>, said <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION>
geologist <PERSON>Laurence Soderblom</PERSON>.
   The second type can erupt explosively, ejecting nitrogen ice and
gas 25 miles high at speeds of 560 mph _ higher and faster than
initially estimated, he said. He said he suspects the nitrogen
volcanoes are active today or were active within the past 300 years.
   Soderblom drew gasps of amazement when he showed a Voyager
photograph of one of the calderas, computer enhanced to make it look
as it would to someone standing on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s surface and seeing the
crater in three dimensions.
   Scientists also presented new findings <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> showing <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
weak, tilted magnetic field doesn't go through the center of planet
but is offset about four-tenths of the way toward the surface. That,
plus new evidence that matter is distributed unevenly inside the
planet, suggests the liquid that generates the magnetic field may
exist in a shallow spherical shell, not in a deep central core as
inside the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   ``These observations are just as arcane as the discoveries of
Captain Cook or even the posthumous accounts of <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>,'' said
<ORGANIZATION>Planetary Society</ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON>Bruce Murray</PERSON>, former director of
<ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION>. ``The discoveries challenge our
imagination and seem just like science fiction. But they may be very
important and very relevant to our grandchildren and their
grandchildren.''
   The knowledge gathered by the Voyagers may help alert their human
masters to the vulnerability of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, a tiny garden threatened by
nuclear warfare, the greenhouse effect and destruction of the ozone
shield.
   ``If you look who discovered these dangers ... you find a
remarkable preponderance of present and past planetary scientists,''
<PERSON>Sagan</PERSON> said.
   He said <PERSON>Sherwood Rowland</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mario Molina</PERSON> first warned of
depletion of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s ozone layer using chemical formulas devised to
help <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> understand the atmosphere of Venus. Molina now works at
<ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION>.
   Sagan and other planetary scientists developed the theory that
smoke from nuclear war could plunge <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> into a dark, cold nuclear
winter and cause mass starvation of those who survived the exchange
of warheads.
   ``The idea ultimately evolved from our attempt to understand the
great Martian dust storm of 1971-72,'' which was detected by Mariner
9 and chilled Mars' already cold surface, <PERSON>Sagan</PERSON> said.
   From <ORGANIZATION>Mariner</ORGANIZATION> and the space probe Pioneer, scientists studied the
runaway ``greenhouse effect'' on <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, where thick clouds trap
solar heat, warming the planet to 900 degrees.
   <PERSON>Sagan</PERSON> said <PERSON>Voyager</PERSON> also helps satisfy human wanderlust and seeks
to answer that most fundamental question _ ``where we come from, how
we fit into the grand cosmological scheme.''
   Voyager 2 keeps looking back at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> until <DATE>Oct. 2</DATE>. Then, like
Voyager 1, it will spend the next 20 or 30 years collecting
information about particles and magnetic fields in space and
searching for the edge of the solar system. Scientists figure the
probes can continue transmitting data until <DATE>2020</DATE>.

   Discovery of a magnetic field around
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> suggests the planet is enveloped by radiation belts, but
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> hopes they won't damage the Voyager 2 spacecraft as it flies
past the planet.
   ``Right now I don't think anyone is terribly alarmed,'' said <PERSON>Norm
Haynes</PERSON>, Voyager project manager at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and
Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Similar radiation belts at <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> disrupted <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s internal
clock, causing some of its instruments to make measurements at the
wrong time.
   Today, Voyager was 2.74 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 5.01 million
miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, speeding toward the giant gas planet at 42,251
mph.
   The ship will make its closest approach to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> at <TIME>8:59 p.m.
PDT</TIME> <DATE>Thursday</DATE> when it zooms about 3,000 miles over the cloudtops of
the solar system's fourth-largest planet. The spacecraft was
launched in <DATE>1977</DATE>, and explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and
Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> announced <DATE>Friday</DATE> that Voyager 2 detected intense, pulselike
radio signals coming from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> _ strong evidence the planet has a
magnetic field. Radio waves are generated when high-speed
electrically charged particles spiral into a planet's atmosphere
along magnetic field lines.
   Mercury, <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus have magnetic fields.
Venus and Mars do not. Whether <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION> has one is unknown, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Magnetic fields are thought to be generated by fluid motion in a
planet's core. Molten iron in <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s core, for example, creates a
magnetic field that traps charged particles in the Van <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> belts.
   Although dissimilar from the ionizing radiation found in a
nuclear reactor, such fields of radiation can damage spacecraft
electronics.
   So far at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, ``there's nothing to indicate it (the
radiation) is anything worse than we expected,'' said <PERSON>Haynes</PERSON>. ``But
time will tell.''
   Existence of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s magnetic field suggests the planet has an
aurora like <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s northern and southern lights, created when
charged particles spiral along magnetic field lines toward a
planet's poles.
   Further study of the magnetic field also should let scientists
determine the exact length of a day on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> _ now believed to be
between 17 and 18 Earth hours _ and gain better understanding of
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s internal structure, said <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION>
spokeswoman <PERSON>Mary Beth Murrill</PERSON>.
   Voyager project scientist <ORGANIZATION>Edward Stone</ORGANIZATION> has said he believes
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s hydrogen-helium outer atmosphere gradually gives way to a
superhot slurry of hot water and rock closer to the planet's center.
   That would mean that <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, like neighboring Uranus, probably
lacks a distinct boundary between the sky and sea.
   Some scientists believe radiation trapped by Uranus' magnetic
field bombards that planet's moons and rings to turn them dark in
color. Neptune's magnetic field may cause similar radiation
darkening of the Neptunian moons and ring arcs, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> also released new photographs taken by Voyager.
Blurry black-and-white images show markings on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
largest moon, but ``it is still too early to tell if the features
are clouds or features on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s surface,'' <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   A color photo of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> shows complex, frequently changing
weather patterns in its atmosphere, including high-altitude wispy
clouds, a small cloud dubbed ``the scooter'' because it rotates
quickly, and other clouds that appear as long streaks.
   In recent weeks, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> also has discovered four Neptunian moons
besides two observed from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>; two partial rings, or ring arcs, of
debris orbiting the planet; and atmospheric patterns similar to jet
streams on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.

   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, the first <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> planetary
spacecraft launched since <DATE>1978</DATE>, fired its braking rocket and
dropped into orbit around <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> <DATE>today</DATE> on a mission to make the best
pictures yet of the planet's cloud-covered terrain.
   ``The system worked as planned. A lot of hard work was
rewarded,'' said <PERSON>George Alexander</PERSON>, chief spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``I'm tremendously gratified we were able to do something for
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> and the public that shows this is a capable agency'' following
troubles with the shuttle fleet and the <ORGANIZATION>Hubble Space Telescope</ORGANIZATION>, he
said. ``This breaks the string of bad luck.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> dived over <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' north pole, then ignited the
forward-facing rocket at <TIME>9:32 a.m.</TIME>, slowing from about 24,600 mph
to roughly 18,500 mph.
   That allowed <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> to be captured by <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' gravity and start
orbiting the second planet from the sun, said mission commentator
<PERSON>Steve Wall</PERSON>.
   The rocket ignition happened when the spacecraft was behind
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, out of radio contact with engineers on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Magellan
emerged at <TIME>9:53 a.m.</TIME>, but preliminary confirmation that all went
well came 13 minutes later because of the time <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s radio
signal takes to reach <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   ``We are now in orbit!'' said <PERSON>David Okerson</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project
engineer.
   In the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project office, ``there was cheering and
applause and whistling and hooting'' by scientists and engineers,
said secretary <PERSON>Sharon Kyle</PERSON>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> encountered Venus 144 million miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> after
circling the sun 1{ times during a roundabout, 948-million-mile
journey.
   The <MONEY>$413 million</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, the heart of a <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY> mission,
was designed to use radar to penetrate thick Venusian clouds,
allowing the spacecraft to make maps and pictures of the planet's
deformed, volcanic landscape with unprecedented detail. Mapping is
slated to start by <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> plans to release the first pictures in <DATE>September</DATE>, but may
do so this month if images made during tests produce any
interesting discoveries.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> has raised <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s hopes after its recent woes,
including the temporary grounding of the shuttle fleet because of
hydrogen leaks and a defective mirror that crippled the <MONEY>$1.5
billion</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Hubble Space Telescope</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The major pressure we feel is the pressure to succeed,''
<PERSON>Wesley T. Huntress Jr.</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> director of solar system exploration,
said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. ``I'd prefer not to speculate on what failure might
mean.''
   The 21-foot <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, deployed from the shuttle Atlantis in <DATE>May
1989</DATE>, was the first <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> planetary spacecraft launched since <DATE>1978</DATE>,
when <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> sent the Pioneer 12 orbiter and the Pioneer 13 probes to
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   ``<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is the beginning of a new era of planetary
exploration,'' <PERSON>Huntress</PERSON> said. ``We're looking forward to the
drama.''
   The Voyager probes explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, Uranus and <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
between <DATE>1979</DATE> and <DATE>last year</DATE>, but they were launched in <DATE>1977</DATE>.
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>, launched in <DATE>October</DATE>, is headed toward a <DATE>1995</DATE> rendezvous
with <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   During the coming decade or so, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> also plans to send
spacecraft to explore Mars, the moon, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, comets and the sun's
polar regions.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> has said <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> would return more data than all previous
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> missions combined.
   Venus is similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in size, density and position in the
solar system, although a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' raised its
surface temperature to 900 degrees Fahrenheit, about as hot as a
self-cleaning oven.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> wants to learn if the planet's geological processes are
similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s. Venus has tens of thousands of volcanoes, but
no one knows if any are active.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was named for the Portuguese explorer <ORGANIZATION>Ferdinand
Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, who sailed around the world in the early 1500s.
   The spacecraft was built by <ORGANIZATION>Martin Marietta Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and its radar
was built by <ORGANIZATION>Hughes Aircraft Co</ORGANIZATION>.

   The latest discoveries come from a far-off realm, Uranus,
relayed by Voyager 2, a marvelous machine launched along with
Voyager 1 in <DATE>1977</DATE> to probe <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>. Voyager 2 was
working so well after exploring <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> reprogrammed it to
sail past Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE> and <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> next <DATE>August</DATE>.
   Uranus is considered the oddball of the solar system because,
unlike the other planets, it lies tipped on its side with its north
and south poles alternately facing the sun. Voyager 2 found that
Uranus' magnetic field does not follow the usual north-south axis
and instead is tilted 60 degrees and offset at the center.
Astronomers believe it might have been knocked off course by an
ancient collision with another celestial object.
   Voyager 2 found that winds on Uranus whip up to 450 mph and blow
from the west instead of the east as previously suspected. About
5,000 miles below the planet's cloudtops, the spacecraft detected
evidence of a boiling ocean of water and dissolved ammonia some
6,000 miles deep. Beneath this ocean, it is believed there is an
Earth-size molten core of heavier materials.
   The spacecraft discovered 10 new moons orbiting Uranus, ranging
from 24 to 102 miles in diameter, much smaller than the planet's
previously recorded five satellites. Uranus was thought to have
nine rings; Voyager found 11. In contrast to <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>'s rings, which
are composed of bright grain-sized particles, Uranus' rings are
made up of dark boulder-sized chunks.
   The Voyagers also discovered a ring around <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the largest
planet in the solar system and a valuable astronomical laboratory
because of the diversity of its system of at least 16 moons.
   During the flyby encounters, the Voyagers and the earlier
Pioneers 10 and 11, found <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> to be a whirling ball of liquid
hydrogen, topped by a uniquely colorful atmosphere which is mostly
hydrogen and helium. They learned the Great Red Spot, observed for
centuries through Earth-based telescopes, is a tremendous
atmospheric storm similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s hurricanes.
   The space probes detected lightning in <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s upper
atmosphere and observed auroral emissions like <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s northern
lights in the Jovian polar regions. Jupiter spins at a dizzying
pace _ once every 9 hours, 55 minutes, 30 seconds _ but it takes
the massive planet almost 12 Earth years to complete a journey
around the sun.
   Before Pioneer 11 and the Voyagers passed by <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, astronomers
knew the planet only as a fuzzy yellow sphere surrounded by six
rings. The startling images relayed back quickly identified several
thousand rings made up of small ice particles orbiting the planet
at various speeds.
   The spacecraft discovered five new Saturnian moons, raising the
total to 17. Titan, the largest, received the most attention
because it is the only moon in the solar system believed to have an
atmosphere. Although it is inconceivable that life could exist in
the oceans of liquid nitrogen and freezing hydrocarbons believed to
form <ORGANIZATION>Titan</ORGANIZATION>'s surface, scientists are intrigued by the possibility
that the giant moon may hold clues about the formation of organic
molecules in the atmosphere of the primeval <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> between three and
four billion years ago.
   The Voyagers also found <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere of hydrogen and
helium alive with monster storms, with winds of 1,100 mph.
   Venus, our sister planet and closest neighbor, more nearly
resembles Earth in size, physical composition and density than any
of the other planets. However, <ORGANIZATION>Mariner</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Pioneer</ORGANIZATION> probes found
that <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> is a blistering hot world where the 900-degree heat is
trapped in a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide.
   Radar peering through <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' thick cloud cover found evidence of
two major active volcano areas. The concentration of lightning over
these areas suggests frequent eruptions. A valley may have been
created by tension in the planet's crust pulling the surface apart
like similar processes on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Photographs taken of <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION>Mariner</ORGANIZATION> 10 in <DATE>1974</DATE> and <DATE>1975</DATE>
revealed an ancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling
our own moon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing
the planet.
   Instruments aboard <ORGANIZATION>Mariner</ORGANIZATION> 10 found that <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION> has a weak
magnetic field and a trace of an atmosphere - a trillionth the
density of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s and composed chiefly of argon, neon and
helium. The spacecraft reported temperatures ranging from 950
degrees Fahrenheit on the sunlight side to 346 degrees below zero
on the shadowed side.
   Of all the planets, Mars has long been considered the solar
system's prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life. But
the results obtained by the Viking 1 and 2 landers in <DATE>1976</DATE> and <DATE>1977</DATE>
were teasingly inconclusive. Small samples of Martian soil were
scooped up and specially treated in three different experiments
designed to detect biological processes. While some of the tests
indicated biological processes were occuring, the same results
could be explained by the planet's chemistry. There was no evidence
of organic molecules in the small areas surveyed by the Vikings.
   The Vikings and earlier <ORGANIZATION>Mariners</ORGANIZATION> found that dust covers the
Martian surface under a sparse atmosphere that allows the wind to
stir up fierce <DATE>summer</DATE> storms. Massive active volcanoes dot the
landscape, and dry sinuous channels, perhaps carved long ago by
flowing water, stretch for hundreds of miles. Many scientists
believe water still lies below the surface, giving rise to
speculation that some form of life might yet be found there.

On its convoluted journey to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft swung by <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> on 
<DATE>Saturday</DATE>, giving scientists the first glimpse of what it might be like to be 
aboard an alien spacecraft flying through the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
At <TIME>12:35 p.m.</TIME>, only four-tenths of a second behind schedule and a mere five 
miles off course, the <MONEY>$1.5-billion</MONEY> nuclear-powered spacecraft flew flawlessly 
less than 600 miles above the <LOCATION>Atlantic Ocean</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"It was virtually perfect," said <PERSON>William J. O'Neil</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s project manager 
at the <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>. "We could have missed by 100 
miles or more . . . and we'd still be on our way to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to communicate the elation one feels with these encounters," said 
<PERSON>Clayne M. Yeates</PERSON>, science and mission design manager at <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s encounter with Earth was like no previous space mission because it 
allowed scientists for the first time to observe the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and moon in the same 
way and with the same instruments that are used to study other planets in the 
solar system. Eventually, scientists hope to be able to make observations and 
detailed comparisons among planets never before possible in space science. 
</P>
<P>
Two extremely sharp photographs taken <DATE>Saturday</DATE> by <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>, one of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 
the other of the moon, gave researchers a hint of the wealth of information 
they can expect when they sift through all the data recorded by the probe 
during the flyby. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever comes of these recorded images, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will surely go down in history 
as "the first time any spacecraft has returned to fly by the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> after 
visiting another planet," <PERSON>O'Neil</PERSON> said. "It's the first confirmed interplanetary 
visitor to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
It will be a week before the spacecraft completes its photographs and 
atmospheric measurements of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and years before all the analyses are 
complete. Yeates jokingly said that at least one <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> scientist already has 
"observed intelligence on Earth" from the pictures he has seen. 
</P>
<P>
Although clearly giddy with enthusiasm at how well the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> encounter went, 
scientists at <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> realize that they have many more hurdles to cross before the 
six-year mission to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> can be labeled a success. 
</P>
<P>
The next major step will take place <DATE>Oct. 29</DATE>, when <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> passes by the 
asteroid Gaspra, where it will take pictures and make measurements. A year 
later, on <DATE>Dec. 8, 1992</DATE>, it will have its second encounter with <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, sweeping 
the skies just 200 miles above <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Both swings around the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, as well as a rendezvous with <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> last <DATE>February</DATE>, 
were designed so the spacecraft can build enough speed to make the long trip to 
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In a complicated maneuver known as "gravity assist," the spacecraft makes use 
of the gravity of planets to alter its orbit around the sun and build up speed 
along the way. 
</P>
<P>
As <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> raced by <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, its speed climbed from 67,240 m.p.h. to 78,860 
m.p.h. in its orbit around the sun. When <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> scoots by <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> two years from 
now, its velocity will be boosted 8,280 m.p.h. to a fiery 87,190 m.p.h. -- fast 
enough to begin the long voyage to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, about 480 million miles from the 
sun. 
</P>
<P>
When <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> arrives at <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> late in <DATE>1995</DATE>, it will have journeyed 2.5 
billion miles and begin the first long-term study of the solar system's largest 
planet. As it enters the vicinity of that planet in the <DATE>summer</DATE> of that year, 
the spacecraft will drop a probe into <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s stormy atmosphere before going 
into orbit for a 20-month tour. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was named for the 17th-Century Italian scientist who discovered 
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s four major moons with one of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s first telescopes.

   Voyager 2, only a day away from its close
encounter with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, was ready for new computer commands today as
it searched for more moons and rings after discovering a first
complete ring around the storm-wracked planet.
   A new picture taken by Voyager shows what appears to be a large
meteorite crater on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s major moon, deputy project
scientist <PERSON>Ellis Miner</PERSON> said <DATE>today</DATE>.
   Howewver, he said, there also are uncratered regions on the moon,
and scientists haven't yet definitely concluded the spot on the
still-fuzzy <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> picture is an impact crater.
   Engineers prepared to send Voyager the computer program this
afternoon to control how the spacecraft aims itself, its cameras and
other sensors during its flight past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON>Doug
Griffith</PERSON>, deputy mission manager at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   The latest navigation information shows that after a 12-year,
4.4-billion-mile flight, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will be within one second and 22
miles of where it is supposed to be for the <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> flyby, he said.
   ``The spacecraft is working marvelously, with no problems at
all,'' <PERSON>Griffith</PERSON> said.
   He said the new computer program, smaller than that contained in
many popular computer games, is crucial to experiments in which
<ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will study the makeup of the atmospheres of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> by sending radio waves through their atmospheres to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Griffith</PERSON> said the new navigation data shows Voyager will make its
closest approach by flying 3,000 miles above <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s cloudtops at
<TIME>18 seconds before 8:56 p.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   Until today's search for more moons, ``suspects have been seen
here and there,'' said <PERSON>Bradford Smith</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>University of Arizona</ORGANIZATION>
planetary scientist who heads <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s photographic imaging team.
``I would expect several more satellites.''
   So far, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> has found four small moons besides Nereid and
backward-orbiting <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, which were first seen years ago from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   After Voyager makes its closest approach to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, the probe
may find a sheet of ring material encircling the planet _ similar to
the broad band of dust it discovered around Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>,
laboratory astronomer <PERSON>Rich Terrile</PERSON> said.
   Smith announced <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> the spacecraft found at least one
complete ring of diffuse debris orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>. He said a partial
ring discovered by the spacecraft almost two weeks ago also may
prove to be a second complete ring. It has parts that are thicker
than other parts.
   <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s find, the latest in a string of discoveries by the
probe during passes by <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus,
elated scientists.
   ``I like the idea Voyager is going out with a bang. It's going to
blow our minds,'' said <PERSON>Carolyn Porco</PERSON>, a planetary scientist with the
<ORGANIZATION>University of Arizona</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION>.
   Pictures taken by Voyager on <DATE>Aug. 11</DATE> revealed two partial rings _
or ring arcs _ extending around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>. One of them couldn't be
found in later images and was dubbed the ``lost arc,'' until Voyager
relocated it <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> and found it goes all the way around the planet.
   Finding a complete ring was surprising. Voyager project scientist
<ORGANIZATION>Edward Stone</ORGANIZATION> said two months ago the planet might be orbited by 50
to 100 ring arcs, but he backed away from that <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   About 9 o'clock PDT tonight, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will cross within 1 million
miles of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, speeding toward the giant gaseous planet at 38,047
mph. It will be about 2.75 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, having traveled
a curving path of 4.4 billion miles since it was launched in <DATE>1977</DATE>.
   At <TIME>2:10 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will zip within 24,000 miles of the
moon <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>.
   Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON> is scheduled to visit the <ORGANIZATION>Jet
Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> several hours later to congratulate Voyager
scientists and engineers.
   Voyager was programmed to search today for more rings and arcs _
including any that might be in or near <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s orbit _ and to look
for ``shepherd moons.'' Rings get their shape from the pull of
gravity between a planet and its moons, so moons that corral rings
are called shepherd moons.
   Today's picture-snapping schedule also included 30 images of
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, four photos of one of the moons Voyager discovered, and 22
pictures of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and its surprisingly turbulent weather, with
racing clouds and an Earth-sized cyclone.
   Because of its bluish color and bright clouds, ``<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> looks
Earthlike,'' <PERSON>Porco</PERSON> said. ``With clouds floating in the atmosphere,
it looks homey.''
   The space probe also was to measure temperatures at various
altitudes in <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s atmosphere.
   Some scientists have said arcs and rings could be the remnants of
moons torn apart by gravitational forces, but <PERSON>Porco</PERSON> said it was more
likely some of them form when moons collide.
   ``We've now seen four different ring systems at four different
planets,'' <PERSON>Terrile</PERSON> said, citing Saturns vast system of broad rings,
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s single narrow ring, and Uranus' 10 thin rings and one
broad sheet of dust that seems to contain dozens of rings.
   ``I find it intriguing to think that in coming to all these
planets, we're seeing ring systems at different stages of
evolution,'' <PERSON>Porco</PERSON> said. ``They have complexity in common. Each
planet is so damn different than the next.''
   The existence of moons and rings around planets in our solar
system suggests ``the processes that formed the Earth are common,''
bolstering the belief that planets orbit stars other than the sun,
<PERSON>Terrile</PERSON> said.

   Voyager 2, now 12 days from its close
encounter with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, has made another discovery that thrilled
scientists: two partial rings of debris orbiting the solar system's
fourth-largest planet.
   ``There is a mood of total elation here,'' said astronomer <PERSON>Rich
Terrile</PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet
Propulsion Laboratory. ``We're really just ecstatic. ... Everything
we've hoped to look at we're going to get to see.''
   Early <DATE>Friday</DATE>, Voyager 2 photographed the two partial rings,
called ``ring arcs.'' They are arc-shaped belts different from the
complete rings that encircle <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, Uranus and <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Since early <DATE>July</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> has discovered four small moons
orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> in addition to the previously known moons, <ORGANIZATION>Nereid</ORGANIZATION>
and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>.
   The probe also has discovered 2,700-mile-wide dark bands _
possibly jet stream-like belts of windblown clouds _ forming a
collar around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s south pole and possibly its north pole.
Voyager 2 earlier revealed a 6,200-mile-wide dark spot in the
planet's atmosphere, probably a giant storm like <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great
Red Spot.
   Today, Voyager 2, traveling at 42,198 mph, was 2.72 billion
miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 11.3 million miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, the fourth
largest planet of the solar system and eighth planet from the sun.
   On <DATE>Aug. 24</DATE>, Voyager 2 is expected to fly about 3,000 miles above
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s cloudtops. The probe was launched in <DATE>1977</DATE>, and explored
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   One of the two ring arcs detected <DATE>Friday</DATE> extends one-eighth of
the distance around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s equator, and the other only
one-thirty-sixth around the planet. That makes them about 30,000
miles and 6,000 miles long, respectively, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON>Terrile</PERSON> said
they may prove longer upon closer examination.
   ``Voyager scientists said the ring arcs may be comprised of
debris associated with nearby moons, or may be remnants of moons
that have been torn apart or ground down through collisions,'' <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
said.
   Scientists don't yet know if the ring arcs are made up of dust,
pebbles or boulders, or if the debris consists primarily of rock or
ice, said <ORGANIZATION>University of Arizona</ORGANIZATION> planetary scientist <PERSON>Brad Smith</PERSON>, who
heads the team analyzing photographs taken by the spacecraft.
   Researchers also don't know if the two partial rings found by
Voyager are among the three to six ring arcs that scientists
previously believed they detected from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, but ``it would be
surprising if they weren't,'' he added.
   Voyager project scientist <ORGANIZATION>Edward Stone</ORGANIZATION> has said <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> may
discover 50 to 100 partial rings orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   ``Astronomers have long suspected the existence of ... an
irregular ring system around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said. ``Voyager's
photographs of the rings arcs are the first photographic evidence
that such a ring system exists.''
   The three to six previously suspected ring arcs were detected by
telescopes on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> as <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> passed in front of a distant star.
   <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>'s extensive rings are made mostly of marble-sized ice
pebbles, while Uranus' rings contain very dark boulders of unknown
composition, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> is encircled by a single thin ring
and a sheet of fine dust, while <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> has some ring arcs in
addition to its rings, <PERSON>Terrile</PERSON> said
   Why does <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> have partial rather than complete rings?
   ``That's the <MONEY>$64,000</MONEY> question,'' <PERSON>Terrile</PERSON> said. ``Rings come in a
variety of shapes and sizes, all the way from complete disks of
material like we've seen at <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, to narrow thin complete
ringlets like we've seen at Uranus. ... We believe the
gravitational influence of moons that orbit nearby give rings their
particular form.''
   Voyager 2 detected the 30,000-mile-long arc just outside the
orbit of one of the newly discovered moons, designated <DATE>1989</DATE> N4,
which orbits about 23,300 miles above <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>. The 6,000-mile long
arc seems to trail about 50,000 miles behind moon <DATE>1989</DATE> N3, which
orbits about 17,000 miles above <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s cloudtops, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.

   Voyager 2, discovered broad, flat bands
of dust orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and found evidence the planet has
``southern lights,'' <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>today</DATE>.
   The probe also detected nitrogen in the atmosphere of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, the
moon whose pink snow and ice volcanoes were described by excited
scientists as unique in the solar system, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   ``There's dust bands _ they're broad,'' said <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> astronomer <PERSON>Rich
Terrile</PERSON>, describing the findings from latest photorgraphs. The bands
orbit <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s equator, as do its narrow rings that were discovered
by Voyager earlier.
   Although Voyager has passed its closest encounters with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, it continued today to back recorded photographs taken
during the time of closest approach. And scientists and engineers
celebrated the spacecraft's successful flyby.
   ``My understanding was most of the engineers and science team had
one hell of a party <TIME>last night</TIME>,'' <PERSON>Mike Urban</PERSON>, a Voyager engineer,
said <DATE>today</DATE>.
   The one-ton space probe capped its historic 4.43-billion-mile,
12-year tour of four planets when it skimmed 3,048 miles over
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s north pole <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, then dove past <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, the
planet's largest moon. It made its closest approach about 23,900
miles above the moon's surface at <TIME>2:10 a.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   During its approach to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, Voyager discovered six moons
besides <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> and Nereid, which were first observed from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. It
also discovered one complete ring of debris around the planet and a
partial ring, or ring arc, scientists believe will also prove to be
a complete ring.
   While only the narrow rings were visible as Voyager flew toward
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, the broad dust bands became visible when they were backlit
by sunlight after the space probe passed the planet, <PERSON>Terrile</PERSON> said.
That makes them look like <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>'s broad rings, but only when viewed
from behind <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   The same thing happened when Voyager passed Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>. That
planet had 10 narrow rings when seen by the approaching spacecraft,
which then found extensive bands of dust after passing Uranus.
<PERSON>Terrile</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s dust bands are not as extensive.
   Evidence for the glowing lights, known as an aurora, was found at
30 degrees south latitude on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> as <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s ultraviolet light
sensor made a north-to-south scan of the planet, deputy project
scientist <PERSON>Ellis Miner</PERSON> said <DATE>today</DATE>.
   Because the scan didn't cover different longitudes, scientists
don't know the aurora's full extent, or whether it circles <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
east to west, as do <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s auroras, <PERSON>Miner</PERSON> said.
   Miner said <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> also found nitrogen in <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere.
Nitrogen makes up <PERCENT>78 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere.
   On Earth, the northern and southern lights encircle the poles,
but can get pushed closer to the equator when the sun generates
magnetic storms. However, it would be very unusual for an aurora on
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> to get as close to the equator as 30 degrees latitude.
   Auroras are caused when electrically charged particles in the
solar wind spiral in toward a planet along magnetivc field lines. On
Earth they glow in visible light. Neptune's lights glow ultraviolet
because of hydrogen in its atmosphere.
   Engineers spent the night unloading Voyager's eight-track tape
recorder _ playing back pictures and scientific data recorded during
the <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> rendezvous _ and also loaded new instructions
telling the probe how to point its cameras and sensors, <ORGANIZATION>Urban</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Voyager today started sending back its most detailed images of
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, which is four-fifth's the size of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s moon. But pictures
returned <DATE>Friday</DATE> were more than enough to stun scientists.
   ``The range of geological forms is dazzling,'' astronomer-author
<PERSON>Carl Sagan</PERSON> said <DATE>Friday</DATE>. ``We are almost certainly in a regime of
volcanism involving ices, maybe exotic ices'' such as water ice
mixed with frozen nitrogen or methane (natural gas).
   The photographs show a cracked, frozen <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> scarred by
thousand-foot-high ridges, fault lines, bowl-shaped craters,
mysterious domes and dark spots ringed with white halos that so far
defy explanation.
   ``The images returned this morning revealed a world unlike any
we've ever seen,'' Voyager project scientist <PERSON>Edward Stone</PERSON> said
<DATE>Friday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
   Icy volcanic flows have been seen on Uranus' moon <PERSON>Ariel</PERSON> and some
other moons, but <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> is the first place scientists have actually
seen ice volcanoes, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said. Photographs showed at least three
inactive volcanoes.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> geologist <PERSON>Joseph Boyce</PERSON> said one of the ice volcanoes _ which
look like dry lakebeds filled with smooth material _ measures
several hundred miles across. Some were encircled with cliffs 1,000
to 2,000 feet high.
   The properties of exotic ices of water, methane and nitrogen
``are very different from ordinary ice,'' said <PERSON>Sagan</PERSON>, a member of
the Voyager imaging team. ``That may explain the exoticness of the
landforms.''
   Parts of the moon are frozen methane discolored by a bombardment
of radiation that produced chemical changes, <PERSON>Sagan</PERSON> said. ``We've got
pink snow. Think about how exotic that is.''
   Preliminary measurements of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s magnetic field suggest that
it does not have a north pole and a south pole like <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s magnetic
field, but rather multiple poles, researchers said.
   <PERSON>Robert Strom</PERSON> of the Voyager imaging team said the relative
scarcity of craters on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> tends to confirm speculation that
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> originated outside the solar system and became captured by
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s gravity, perhaps after colliding with one of its moons.
   Voyager also revealed that <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> has an atmosphere and is
covered with a haze of what could be photochemical smog.
   On the moon's sunlit southern hemisphere, frozen methane or other
volatile material is boiling off the surface, causing haze, and
condensing on the moon's cooler regions, scientists said.
   Voyager 2 was launched in <DATE>1977</DATE> and explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>. Until <DATE>Oct. 2</DATE>, Voyager 2 will look
back at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>. Then it will head toward interstellar space.
   Weary <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> scientists, many of whom spent all night at the
laboratory analyzing data returning from the spacecraft, gushed over
the spectacular images being received.
   <PERSON>Laurence Soderblom</PERSON> of the Voyager imaging team said: ``Wow! What
a way to leave the solar system.''

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft developed
camera trouble today after zooming around cloud-covered Venus in a
``celestial billiard shot'' that speeded the robot explorer toward
its <DATE>1995</DATE> encounter with <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Although the glitch threatened to prevent <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> from snapping
five dozen more pictures of Venus tonight and next week, project
scientist <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory said
it should cause no permanent problems for the mission.
   Mission director <PERSON>Neal Ausman</PERSON> said the TV camera shutter, after
taking 16 planned pictures of Venus early today, clicked open and
closed 452 times, twice per minute, apparently because of faulty
commands from the probe's main computer.
   Ausman, speaking at a news conference, said the unwanted
computer commands then stopped for reasons not immediately
understood, and a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> was working to fix the problem.
   The extra exposures weren't recorded, the malfunction won't harm
the 16 pictures that were taken, the camera was undamaged, and
engineers shut off the camera until it can be repaired, project
manager <PERSON>Dick Spehalski</PERSON> said.
   The 2.8-ton spacecraft made its closest approach to Venus at
<TIME>9:59 p.m. PST</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE>. It was supposed to pass 10,028 miles above
the furnace-like surface of the second planet from the sun, but
actually came three or four miles closer, said mission science and
design manager <PERSON>Bill O'Neil</PERSON>.
   ``We have clearly achieved the sole objective of going to Venus:
a trajectory that will help us ultimately reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>,'' he said.
   As a result, scientists won't be very disappointed if the
malfunction prevents <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> from snapping an additional five dozen
planned pictures of <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, which has been photographed by numerous
other spacecraft, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   The 16 pictures taken will be used to study wind and cloud
patterns and search for lightning that might indicate the presence
of volcanoes erupting beneath the clouds.
   The spacecraft's ultraviolet, visible and infrared light sensors
studied the makeup of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' carbon dioxide atmosphere, mapped
cloud-top temperatures and looked for the glow of the hot lower
atmosphere backlighting cooler clouds overhead, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   The pictures and data were stored on <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s tape recorder,
and won't be sent back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> until <DATE>October</DATE> when the spacecraft
is close enough to transmit the material with its low-gain antenna.
That antenna now can be used only for communications to keep
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> operating.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s main umbrella-shaped antenna must remain furled to
protect it from sunlight until after the craft cruises past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
on <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE>.
   The <MONEY>$1.35 billion</MONEY> mission also will let <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> examine <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,
its moon and one or two asteroids before the spacecraft separates
into an orbiter and a small probe in <DATE>July 1995</DATE>. In <DATE>December 1995</DATE>,
they arrive at <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the solar system's largest planet, after a
2.4-billion-mile trip, including 182 million miles to reach <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was deployed from space shuttle Atlantis last <DATE>Oct. 18</DATE>.
   Acid-laden clouds extend 40 miles above <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' surface, trapping
heat in a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' that raises surface
temperatures to 900 degrees Fahrenheit. Atmospheric pressure is 90
times that on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said the photos and measurements of Venus were secondary
to the main purpose of the flyby: using the planet as a ``gravity
slingshot'' to expand the spacecraft's orbit and boost its speed to
88,740 mph from 83,750 mph.
   ``We have gained enough energy out of this celestial billiard
shot to get the energy we need to make it all the say to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>,''
<PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will use the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> as a gravity slingshot next <DATE>December</DATE>
and again <DATE>Dec. 8, 1992</DATE>, so it will be properly aimed toward
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft, launched from <LOCATION>Atlantis</LOCATION> <DATE>last May 4</DATE>,
will go into orbit around Venus in <DATE>August</DATE>. It will use radar map at
least <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' surface during a <MONEY>$550 million</MONEY> mission.
   When the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe and orbiter reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the probe will
parachute into the atmosphere and make measurements until intense
heat and pressure vaporizes it. The orbiter will photograph and
study <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and its major moons until late <DATE>1997</DATE>, circling the
planet instead of flying past it like the Pioneer and Voyager
spacecraft.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s roundabout route to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> is an indirect result of
the <DATE>1986</DATE> explosion that destroyed the shuttle Challenger and killed
seven crew members. After the tragedy, the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and
Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> decided against using powerful, volatile,
liquid-fueled Centaur rockets to launch spacecraft after they were
deployed from shuttles.
   Instead, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was launched by a weaker booster after it was
released from Atlantis' cargo bay. That made it necessary to use
the gravity of Venus and Earth to help speed and aim <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> toward
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION>Centaur</ORGANIZATION> would have propelled <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> to Venus in only
two years.
   Environmentalists failed in court to block <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s mission.
They feared a Challenger-like explosion could contaminate <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>
with plutonium in <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear batteries, which generate
electricity using heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium.
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said the risk was minimal.

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> scientists said <DATE>Sunday</DATE> they plan to
launch ``the <ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce</ORGANIZATION> of spacecraft'' from a space shuttle <DATE>Oct.
12</DATE>, catapulting the ship <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> so it can parachute a
probe into the giant planet's atmosphere.
   During its looping voyage toward a <DATE>December 1995</DATE> rendezvous with
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the spacecraft will fly by <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, pass <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> twice, see
parts of the moon not seen since the early <DATE>1960s</DATE> and make the first
close approach to an asteroid, the researchers said.
   The swings past <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> will catapult the spacecraft to
higher speeds so that it can reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> with the least
expenditure of fuel, the researchers said.
   When it passes <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will observe gases that cause
``greenhouse effect'' warming of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere, study depletion
of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s protective ozone layer, and make detailed observations of
parts of the moon for which only relatively primitive maps from the
early <DATE>1960s</DATE> are available, said <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>, the project
scientist.
   ``The <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft is a marvel,'' <PERSON>Neal Ausman Jr.</PERSON>, the
mission director, said during a news conference at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet
Propulsion Laboraory. ``It is the most complex spacecraft we've ever
flown at <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> _ probably the most complex spacecraft ever.''
   <PERSON>Clayne Yeates</PERSON>, acting science and mission design manager, called
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> the ``the <ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce</ORGANIZATION> of spacecraft,'' with an array of
scientific instruments that will allow far more detailed images and
scientific data on <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and its moons than could be obtained by
the twin Voyager spacecraft.
   Among the innovations is a new imaging device that will allow
researchers to take a picture every two-and-one-third seconds. The
television cameras on Voyager 2 can take a picture only once every
50 or 60 seconds, said <PERSON>Yeates</PERSON>.
   Voyager 2 is flying past the planet <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> <DATE>this week</DATE>, the climax
of its 12-year, 4.4-billion trek past four planets. It explored
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will drop a probe by parachute into the Jovian atmosphere
to make detailed observations. <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere is covered with
ammonia clouds and may contain ice clouds and water droplets
underneath.
   Researchers expect to get data on lightning bolts 10,000 to
100,000 times as strong as those seen on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will pass
600 miles from the Jovian moon Io, which has the most active
volcanoes in the solar system.
   The shuttle Atlantis is scheduled to carry <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> into <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
orbit <DATE>Oct. 12</DATE>, then launch the spacecraft. <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will be boosted
into a trajectory that will take it looping around <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, where it
will study the planet's atmosphere and make an attempt to confirm
the existence of lightning there.
   Galileo then will swing back past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in <DATE>December 1990</DATE>, using
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s gravity as a slingshot to pick up speed.
   Its next stop will be the asteroid belt between <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and Mars,
where in <DATE>October 1991</DATE> it will pass 600 miles from the asteroid
Gaspra, a typical asteroid about 10 miles long.
   ``We don't have any pictures of asteroids,'' said <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>.
``Nobody's been by one.''
   The spacecraft then will swing past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> again before being sent
on its way to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. It may have a second opportunity to pass by
an asteroid in <DATE>August 1993</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will make about 10 orbits around <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, passing closest
to Io but also near <LOCATION>Europa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ganymede</LOCATION>, two other Jovian moons.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> mission has been repeatedly delayed since work began
in <DATE>1977</DATE>, at which time launch was set for <DATE>1982</DATE>. Budget cuts during
the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration, design changes and the explosion of the
Challenger space shuttle all contributed to the delay, said <PERSON>John
Casani</PERSON>, former project manager and now in charge of all flight
projects at <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION>.

   Voyager 2 discovered at least six tiny
``moonlets'' hidden in one of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s two brightest rings, and
also found three more rings orbiting the planet, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   Voyager's scientists also reported the solar system's
fourth-largest planet is surrounded by a radiation belt and has a
tilted magnetic field, and may have an aurora like <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s northern
and southern lights.
   The researchers said nitrogen _ the gas that makes up <PERCENT>78 percent</PERCENT>
of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere _ is the main component in the skies of
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, the frosty Neptunian moon sculpted with faults, cliffs, pink
snow, meteorite craters and inactive volcanoes that once oozed
viscous ice instead of molten rock. Methane, or natural gas, is
present as well, they said.
   By <TIME>9 a.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, Voyager will be 2.29 million miles from
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, speeding away from the planet at 37,689 mph. The probe will
be 2.75 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Voyager traveled a curving
4.43-billion-mile path to achieve <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>'s close encounter
with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>'s flight past <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We have five rings at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>,'' including the two bright ones
found earlier by the spacecraft and three new ones, said <PERSON>Bradford
Smith</PERSON>, leader of the Voyager photographic imaging team at the space
agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said later the boundaries between the five rings aren't
well defined, so there could be as few as three rings or as many as
five. He reversed himself later <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, deciding the rings are
distinct enough to count the total as five.
   A bright ring discovered <DATE>Aug. 11</DATE> initially appeared to be a
partial ring, called a ring arc, but proved to be a complete ring.
Six to eight icy objects _ the largest no bigger than 6 miles to 12
miles wide _ are embedded in that ring, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said.
   ``You could refer to them as moonlets,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said the gravity of the moonlets may explain why the ring
has a clumpy appearance, with some segments wider than others.
   So far, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> has discovered six objects orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> that
are large enough to be called moons. That brings the total to eight
moons, including <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> and Nereid, which were discovered from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The ring containing the moonlets remains <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s outermost
ring. Next toward the planet is a narrow newly discovered ring,
followed by another previously unknown ring that is a broad, diffuse
band of dust. Then comes the other ring discovered earlier. Closest
to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> is the third newly discovered ring, a broad, diffuse band
of dust <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said was 1,550 miles wide.
   The initial confusion over the number of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s rings is
reminiscent of what happened at Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>. Ten thin rings were
apparent as Voyager neared Uranus. But after the spacecraft passed
that planet, a wide sheet of rings and dust bands became visible
when backlit by the sun. As a result, scientists still are arguing
how many distinct rings orbit Uranus.
   Researchers said <DATE>Saturday</DATE> that Voyager also found:
   _<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s magnetic poles are tilted at least 30 degrees away
from the poles around which the planet rotates. Earth's magnetic
axis is angled 12 degrees away from its rotational axis, putting one
magnetic pole in northern <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> about 1,000 miles from the true, or
rotational, north pole.
   _The planet is surrounded by a radiation belt much weaker than
the <ORGANIZATION>Van Allen</ORGANIZATION> belts encircling <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. The radiation belt's location
near the orbit of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> may explain the pinkish hue of some of the
moon's surface. Radiation bombardment can turn frozen natural gas
that color.
   Deputy Voyager project scientist <PERSON>Ellis Miner</PERSON> said there is
evidence from an ultraviolet light sensor that, at 30 degrees south
latitude, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> has an aurora similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s northern and
southern lights. Other scientists <DATE>Saturday</DATE> refused to discuss the
evidence, saying it was too preliminary.
   If the aurora proves real, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s tilted magnetic field would
explain why the glowing lights are relatively close to the planet's
equator rather than the rotational poles.
   Auroras are caused when electrically charged particles in solar
wind spiral in toward a planet along magnetic field lines. On Earth,
they surround the polar regions because the magnetic and rotational
poles are relatively close.
   Voyager continued <DATE>Saturday</DATE> to send back recorded photographs
taken during its Neptune-Triton flyby, including its most detailed
photos of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>.
   The spaceship also looked over its shoulder to make a global
temperature map of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, search for auroras and more rings, and
study the weight of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>.
   Voyager 2 was launched in <DATE>1977</DATE> and explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>. Until <DATE>Oct. 2</DATE>, Voyager 2 will look
back at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>. Then it will head toward interstellar space,
looking for the edge of the solar system.

   <ORGANIZATION>Hughes Aircraft Co.</ORGANIZATION> will ship its

space shuttle can launch the probe and a mother ship toward <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>
in <DATE>October</DATE>.
   The <MONEY>$1.36 billion</MONEY>, six-year, 2.4-billion-mile voyage was delayed
3{ years by the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger.
   ``This is a very proud day for us. We are ready to deliver it to
JPL (<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory) on its way to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>,''
<PERSON>Hughes</PERSON> vice president <PERSON>Steven Dorfman</PERSON> said at a news conference
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   Hughes spokesman <PERSON>Richard Dore</PERSON> said the 4-foot-diameter,
teardrop-shaped probe would be trucked <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> across the <LOCATION>Los
Angeles</LOCATION> area to <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>, where JPL runs <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s unmanned space
exploration program for the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space

   Engineers will prepare the probe for shipment to the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy
Space Center</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>April</DATE>, followed the next month by the mother ship,
or <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> orbiter. After the two are attached, the combined
spacecraft will be mounted on a solid fuel booster rocket and placed
aboard the shuttle Atlantis.
   The launch is expected to take place between <DATE>Oct. 12</DATE> and about
<DATE>Nov. 21</DATE>.
   After exploring two asteroids, the orbiter and probe will reach
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>December 1995</DATE>, after separating 150 days earlier. The
probe will enter <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere at 115,000 mph, then deploy a
parachute as it falls about 370 miles through the planet's
atmosphere.
   The probe will collect and relay information for up to 75 minutes
before it is crushed by <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s tremendous atmospheric pressure.
   The orbiter will circle <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> for at least 20 months, studying
the planet and its surrounding moons, magnetic field and
electrically charged particles.
   The data will help scientists better understand the origin of
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the solar system and the universe, said <PERSON>Richard Young</PERSON>,
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe project scientist at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Ames Research Center</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Mountain View</LOCATION>.
   Galileo had been scheduled to be launched from a space shuttle in
<DATE>May 1986</DATE> and powered out of orbit atop a Centaur booster for a
three-year trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the solar system's largest planet and
the fifth from the sun.
   Then Challenger blew up on <DATE>Jan. 28, 1986</DATE>, killing seven crew
members and grounding the shuttle fleet until last <DATE>fall</DATE>. After the
tragedy, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> decided it was too dangerous to carry liquid-fueled
Centaurs aboard the shuttle.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s route to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> was drastically redesigned and
lengthened because <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> are no longer aligned as
ideally as they were in <DATE>1986</DATE> and because the new booster is less
powerful.
   Because of the launch delay and the longer flight time, the probe
was taken apart for refurbishing and to make sure some parts
wouldn't fail because of aging, and its scientific instruments were
retested.
   On the new flight plan, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will take six years instead of
three years to get to the gaseous, giant planet, traveling 2.4
billion miles although <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> is about 400 million miles from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Dore</ORGANIZATION> said. To gain energy for the trip, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will use the
gravity of Venus and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in a slingshot effect.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will swing toward <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> in <DATE>February 1990</DATE>, swing back
toward Earth that <DATE>December</DATE>, circle the sun, and swing around <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
again in <DATE>December 1992</DATE> before finally heading for <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   The delay increased the probe's cost to <MONEY>$157 million</MONEY> from <MONEY>$133
million</MONEY>, said <PERSON>Benny Chin</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe project manager at
<ORGANIZATION>NASA-Ames</ORGANIZATION>. Total cost of the mission, from its official start in
<DATE>1977</DATE> through completion in late <DATE>1997</DATE> is about <MONEY>$1.36 billion</MONEY>, said
<PERSON>Richard Spehalski</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> project manager at <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Spehalski</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> approval for the launch is expected in
<DATE>September</DATE>. Such approval is needed because the probe and orbiter
each carry a power plant and heater containing radioactive
plutonium. A <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> environmental impact statement concluded last
month that the risk of a nuclear accident when the shuttle lifts off
with <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is very small.

<HEAD>Anti-Nuclear Activists Vow To Disrupt Shuttle Launch Because of Plutonium</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> starts the countdown <DATE>Monday</DATE>,
but <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s launch of the space shuttle Atlantis depends on
whether a federal judge permits its five astronauts to dispatch the
nuclear-powered <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Anti-nuclear activists have sued to halt the flight, arguing
that a launch accident could spread radioactive plutonium over
densely populated parts of <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>. The space agency maintains the
danger is almost non-existent.
   Both sides will argue their cases in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District Court in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, at <TIME>10 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. <PERSON>Judge Oliver Gasch</PERSON> then will
decide whether to grant a temporary restraining order to stop the
launch, or to let the countdown proceed. This is the first time
anyone has gone to court to stop a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> launch.
   The plutonium argument overshadows the fact that the mission
involves the most expensive, most sophisticated unmanned space
probe ever built, a vehicle one mission official calls ``the
<ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce</ORGANIZATION> of spacecraft.''
   After a six-year outward journey, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>, priced at <MONEY>$1.4
billion</MONEY>, is to shoot a probe into <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere and then
orbit the planet for two years.
   Mission planners say its investigation of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and its moons
will be the most scientifically rich that interplanetary
exploration has witnessed. The <DATE>1979</DATE> Voyager views of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and
its satellites were fascinating, but <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s images will be 1,000
times clearer, they say.
   The countdown is to start at <TIME>8 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Monday</DATE>. If <PERSON>Gasch</PERSON> does not
rule quickly, the count will pause at the 11-hour mark, for several
days if necessary, awaiting a decision. Several critical steps,
including fueling the shuttle, occur after that point.
   If <PERSON>Gasch</PERSON> gives the green light, and no other problems arise,
Atlantis is scheduled to blast off at <TIME>1:29 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The activists vow that if they lose in court, they will
physically try to stop the liftoff.
   ``We are going to attempt to enter the launch area and sit on
the launch pad,'' said <PERSON>Bruce Gagnon</PERSON>, coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION>Florida
Coalition of Peace and Justice</ORGANIZATION>, one of three groups that filed the
suit.
   Extra security measures have been in force several days,
including closing to the public several roads approaching <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy
Space Center</ORGANIZATION>. These roads are normally closed only on launch days.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials are concerned that <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s brief, 10-minute
launch window would vanish if protesters penetrate the launch zone
with a boat or plane in the count's final minutes.
   At issue are <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s two generators and their fuel: 48 pounds
of radioactive plutonium-238 dioxide.
   The activists say that if the space shuttle crashed or exploded,
as the Challenger did in <DATE>1986</DATE>, the poisonous plutonium would be
released into the air.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> has said the ``highest probability of launch-area release
of plutonium due to a shuttle accident is less than 1 in 2,500 and
such a release would have no appreciable adverse effects on the
population.''
   The agency quotes health physicists who say this type of
plutonium is relatively harmless unless a particle is inhaled or
lodges in an open wound, where it could cause cancer. Generally the
particles do not travel far in air and can be stopped by a piece of
paper or unbroken human skin.
   In tests, empty graphite plutonium containers have been blown
up, shot at and burned to determine how they survive all types of
accidents. They have withstood pressures far greater than those
generated by the Challenger explosion, say <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Energy
Department</ORGANIZATION>, which took part in the testing.
   The space agency notes that similar generators have flown on 22
space vehicles, including five manned Apollo moon missions, and
that in three instances the well-protected devices survived severe
accidents: two unmanned rockets that blew up in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> and the
explosion aboard Apollo 13 in <DATE>1970</DATE>, which forced abandonment of a
moon landing.
   Plutonium 238's normal decay gives off intense heat, which
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will convert to electricity. No other power source is
practical for space missions too far from the sun to use solar
energy.
   The five astronauts who will fly the mission say they are not
concerned about flying with plutonium.
   ``I have no absolutely no qualms about the devices,'' said
commander <PERSON>Donald Williams</PERSON>.
   Pilot <PERSON>Mike McCulley</PERSON> was more blunt: ``I don't see how it can
hurt anyone unless it hits him on the head, and that's pretty
remote. I think it is a complete non-issue except as a
philosophical issue to some people.''
   ``My family is going to be down there watching the launch, as
well as other people that I love, and so I'm not concerned about
it; I feel it's safe,'' said mission specialist <PERSON>Ellen Baker</PERSON>.
   The other crew members, mission specialists <PERSON>Shannon Lucid</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Franklin Chang-Diaz</PERSON>, expressed similar feelings.
   Six hours after liftoff, the astronauts are to release <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>
from the cargo bay. An hour later, an attached motor will start the
6,700-pound craft on a six-year trip that will cover 2.4 billion
miles on the path to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the largest planet in our solar
system.
   Along the way, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will obtain fly-by data about the moon,
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and at least one asteroid, <LOCATION>Gaspra</LOCATION>. It will make two return
swings to within 600 miles of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   In <DATE>December 1995</DATE> a 737-pound probe released from the spacecraft
is to plunge into <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s cloud layers at 115,000 mph and make
the first direct sampling of the Jovian atmosphere. Slowed quickly
by the thickening atmosphere, the probe will pop a parachute and
transmit data to the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> mother ship for about an hour as it
descends about 360 miles before it is crushed and vaporized by
extreme heat and pressure.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will fire into orbit about the planet, and its 10
scientific instruments will gather information on temperatures,
magnetic fields, radiation, cloud characteristics and gravity
fields.
   Of particular interest will be the dynamics of a weather system
that produce the ever-changing bands, whirls and plumes seen from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and from the two Voyager spacecraft.
   The weather includes storms up to 25,000 miles across that have
raged for centuries. Among them is the mysterious Great Red Spot,
which the Voyagers determined is a tremendous atmospheric storm
similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s hurricanes.
   The Voyagers also found that <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, 318 times more massive
than <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, is a whirling ball of mostly liquid hydrogen, topped by
an atmosphere that is mostly hydrogen and helium. They discovered a
narrow ring of debris around the planet and found three new moons,
raising the toal to 16.
   The four largest moons bear the same relationship to their
planet as planets in our solar system do to the sun _ the nearest
being solid rock, like <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION>, and the farthest being a slush ball
with a rock in the center, like gaseous <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   Thus, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will examine data and transmit pictures of a
miniature solar system as it orbits <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON>Edward C. Stone</PERSON>,
professor of physics at the <ORGANIZATION>California Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>, who
is one of the mission scientists.
   ``<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will give us more than just snapshots in passing, as
the Voyagers did,'' Stone said. ``Being there and observing over a
period of nearly two years will allow us to sort out the dynamics
of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and its moons.''

   The spacecraft <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> grabbed <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s
gravity coattails <DATE>Saturday</DATE> and arced around the planet on a
fleeting visit home 13{ months into a six-year voyage to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Taking pictures and exploring with instruments, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> used
Earth as a gravity slingshot, hurtling 597 miles above the western
<LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>, the point of closest approach.
   The encounter, at <TIME>12:35 p.m. PST</TIME>, increased the craft's speed by
11,600 mph, giving it a speed of 79,000 mph relative to the sun.
Relative to the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, which is also moving, the maximum speed was
30,721 mph.
   ``Everything is working exactly as it should,'' said mission
director <PERSON>Neal E. Ausman Jr.</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory as
the craft flew through <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s shadow. ``We've had no glitches, no
problems.''
   Project officials said the flyby was a valuable dress rehearsal
for the <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> encounter.
   ``Every time we turn an instrument on, we have problems
understanding what we've done to it, and what we probably can do to
the software,'' said <PERSON>Clayne M. Yeates</PERSON>, science and mission design
manager. ``So we're really learning how to operate these
instruments. It's been invaluable for us to collect this data.''
   Project manager <PERSON>William J. O'Neil</PERSON> added, ``Once we do figure out
what they're doing we find that they're operating up to expectation
or beyond.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s looping 2.4 billion-mile route to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> made it the
first planetary spacecraft to approach Earth from space and
provided scientists the first opportunity to look at the world in
the same way as they have other planets.
   Controllers ordered <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s instruments to measure gases that
cause ``greenhouse effect'' warming of the atmosphere and study
high-altitude water vapor involved in creating and destroying the
ozone layer.
   The trajectory also allowed scientists to explore the far side
of the moon, always facing away from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, with modern instruments
for the first time. The far side observations will occur over
several days.
   Galileo approached from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s dark side, measuring its
magnetic field and solar plasma flows, and taking pictures of the
crescent moon.
   Two pictures released soon after the flyby showed a portion of
the near-side of the moon and a cloud-streaked view of central
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. Data and pictures will continue to come in as <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>
speeds away.
   Its path also took it 2,162 miles above the orbiting space
shuttle <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>.
   Exploration of the blue planet and its moon was an added bonus
to <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s <MONEY>$1.4 billion</MONEY> mission.
   The spacecraft was originally designed to make a 2{-year direct
flight to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> for long-term observation of the solar system's
biggest planet.
   But the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s safety
review after the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in <DATE>1986</DATE>
led to changes in <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s own booster system that made a direct
flight impossible because its new rocket was less powerful.
   Shuttle Atlantis carried <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> into orbit <DATE>Oct. 18, 1989</DATE>, and
launched it on a roundabout trajectory using three gravity assists
from <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The spacecraft flew past <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> on <DATE>Feb. 10</DATE>. It will get another
boost from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> on <DATE>Dec. 8, 1992</DATE>. That encounter will be closer, at
an altitude of about 200 miles. The pass will also greatly widen
its orbit around the sun in order to intercept <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will go into orbit around <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Dec. 7, 1995</DATE>.
   A probe launched from <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> five months earlier will plunge
into the atmosphere at 100,000 mph, deploy a parachute and make
measurements for 75 minutes until it is crushed by intense
pressure.
   The orbiter will continue to explore <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and 10 of its 16
known moons for two years.

   Images from the Voyager 2 spacecraft
revealed three previously unknown moons circling <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>,
scientists at the <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> announced today.
   The discoveries, in addition to a moon spotted by Voyager 2 <DATE>last
month</DATE>, bring to six the number of satellites known to be orbiting
the blue planet, laboratory officials said.
   Voyager was more than 22 million miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> when the
moons were confirmed by scientists <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, indicating there may
be many more discoveries as the space probe draws even closer in
coming weeks.
   The newly discovered moons were temporarily named <DATE>1989</DATE> N2, <DATE>1989</DATE>
N3 and <DATE>1989</DATE> N4. The objects were tracked as ``candidate moons'' for
five days and then confirmed when they followed predicted orbits.
   The moons appear to range between 60 miles and 125 miles in
diameter and are in circular, equatorial orbits moving in the
direction of the planet's rotation. Neptune's big moon, <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>,
moves in the opposite direction.
   The moon <DATE>1989</DATE> N3 is closest to the planet, orbiting 17,000 miles
above <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s cloud tops and completing one orbit every 8 hour
and 10 minutes.
   Orbiting 23,000 miles above the clouds, <DATE>1989</DATE> N4 circles <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
in 10 hours and 20 minutes.
   The farthest out of the three, <DATE>1989</DATE> N2 is 30,000 miles above the
clouds and completes each orbit in 13 hours and 30 minutes.
   Voyager 2 is on a course that will take it within 3,000 miles of
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 24</DATE>. The spacecraft was launched in <DATE>1977</DATE> and has
been past <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus. It is more than 2.7 billion
miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Jet <ORGANIZATION>Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> operates <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s unmanned spacecraft

   Pioneer 11, the first spacecraft to visit
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, flew beyond the orbit of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> and became the
fourth human-made craft to exit the solar system, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> and the
probe's builder said.
   ``We wish it a fond farewell,'' said <PERSON>Montye Male</PERSON>, a spokeswoman
for <ORGANIZATION>TRW Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which built Pioneer 11 at its <ORGANIZATION>Space &amp; Technology
Group</ORGANIZATION> facility in <LOCATION>Redondo Beach</LOCATION>.
   Neptune is now the outermost planet. <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION> currently is closer
to the sun in an elongated, elliptical orbit, part of which is
beyond <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s path.
   By crossing <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s orbit <DATE>Friday</DATE> at a distance of 2.8 billion
miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, Pioneer 11 followed Pioneer 10 and Voyagers 1 and
2 out of the solar system, said <PERSON>Peter Waller</PERSON>, spokesman for the
<ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Ames Research
Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Mountain View</LOCATION>.
   Both officials acknowledged that some don't consider the orbit
of the outermost planet to be the edge of the solar system. Some
scientists consider the true edge to be the heliopause, where solar
wind yields to interstellar wind an estimated 5 billion to 14
billion miles from the sun.
   A few even consider the solar system to end at the <ORGANIZATION>Oort Cloud</ORGANIZATION>, a
theorized but yet-unseen spherical cloud of comets that may be
located about 7 trillion to 14 trillion miles from the sun.
   <PERSON>Waller</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> considers the Pioneers and Voyagers to be
outside the solar system because _ to use a seafaring analogy _
``once you've left land behind, you don't worry about coastal
waters.''
   Pioneer 11 was launched <DATE>April 5, 1973</DATE>, and visited <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> on
<DATE>Dec. 2, 1974</DATE>, a year after Pioneer 10 flew past the solar system's
largest planet. Pioneer 11 whizzed by <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> at 107,373 mph, which
<PERSON>Waller</PERSON> said was the fastest speed ever traveled by a spacecraft.
   It passed only 26,600 miles from <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s cloud tops _ much
closer than the Voyager 1 and 2 flybys in <DATE>1979</DATE> _ and was bombarded
by the planet's intense radiation belts.
   On <DATE>Sept. 1, 1979</DATE>, it became the first spacecraft to explore
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, visiting the ringed planet 14 months ahead of Voyager 1 and
two years ahead of Voyager 2. Pioneer 10 didn't fly past <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Waller</PERSON> said in a telephone interview that Pioneer 11 flew about
13,000 miles from <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, taking the first closeup pictures of that
planet, discovering two small moonlets and a ring, and collecting
data that scientists used to determine that the major moon, <ORGANIZATION>Titan</ORGANIZATION>,
was too cold for life despite the presence of organic chemicals.
   Although Pioneer 11 was launched four years before the Voyagers,
it took longer to fly beyond the outermost planet's orbit because
it is traveling through space in the same direction as the sun and
the rest of the solar system, <PERSON>Male</PERSON> said.
   In <DATE>June 1983</DATE>, Pioneer 10 became the first spacecraft to pass
beyond the planets. It is now 4.5 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Male</PERSON>
said.
   In three years, it will become difficult to simultaneously
operate Pioneer 11's radio transmitter and scientific instruments,
although engineers may be able to get the spacecraft to send back
data on solar wind until <DATE>1995</DATE>, project manager <PERSON>Richard Fimmel</PERSON> said.
   Pioneer 10, with a stronger power supply, may return information
through the year <DATE>2000</DATE>.

<HEAD>Galileo Probe Rebuilt For October Launch, 1995 Plunge Into Jovian
Skies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A space probe grounded for 3{ years by
the Challenger explosion has been rebuilt for an <DATE>October</DATE> launch to
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, where it will plunge to its doom as it seeks clues to the
birth of the solar system.
   The <MONEY>$1.36 billion</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> mission should climax in <DATE>December 1995</DATE>,
when the probe deploys a parachute and collects information for 75
minutes before it is crushed by <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s intense atmospheric
pressure.
   Its mother ship, the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> orbiter, will circle the planet for
22 months.
   <ORGANIZATION>Hughes Aircraft Co.</ORGANIZATION> planned to deliver the refurbished <MONEY>$157
million</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe late this afternoon in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s
Jet Propulsion Laboratory is completing modifications to the orbiter.
   ``This is a very proud day for us. We are ready to deliver it to
<ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> on its way to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON>Hughes</PERSON> Vice President <PERSON>Steven Dorfman</PERSON>
said at a news conference <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   JPL will send the 4-foot-diameter, teardrop-shaped probe to
<ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> in late <DATE>April</DATE>, followed by the
orbiter in <DATE>mid-May</DATE>. The probe and orbiter then will be hooked up
together, placed atop a booster rocket, and finally loaded into the
cargo bay of the shuttle Atlantis.
   The shuttle, set for launch no earlier than <DATE>Oct. 12</DATE> and no later
than about <DATE>Nov. 21</DATE>, will release the combined <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft
into <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbit. Then <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s rocket will fire, sending the
orbiter and probe on a circuitous, 2.4-billion-mile, six-year voyage
to the solar system's largest planet, which is the fifth planet from
the sun and is about 400 million miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   En route to the giant gaseous planet, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will observe two
asteroids. The probe and orbiter will separate 150 days before they
reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, then fly in tandem until the probe enters the
atmosphere at 115,000 mph. The probe will deploy a parachute and
descend about 370 miles through Jovian skies until it is crushed by
pressure more than 25 times <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere.
   Data from the probe will help scientists better understand the
origin of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the solar system and the universe, said <PERSON>Richard
Young</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe project scientist at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics
and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Ames Research Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Mountain View</LOCATION>.
   Scientists believe the Jovian atmosphere could be a sample of the
original material from which stars are formed, according to a Hughes
statement.
   The orbiter will measure <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s electrical particle and
magnetic fields, and snap 50,000 photographs of the planet and its
moons, including Io, <LOCATION>Europa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ganymede</LOCATION> and Callisto, which were
discovered in <DATE>1610</DATE> by Italian astronomer <ORGANIZATION>Galileo Galilei</ORGANIZATION>.
   The spacecraft had been scheduled for launch from a space shuttle
in <DATE>May 1986</DATE> and powered out of orbit atop a Centaur booster for a
three-year trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. But Challenger exploded on <DATE>Jan. 28,
1986</DATE>, killing its crew of seven and grounding the shuttle fleet
until last <DATE>fall</DATE>.
   After the tragedy, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> decided it was too dangerous to carry
liquid-fueled Centaur rockets aboard the shuttle. <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s route to
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> was drastically redesigned and lengthened from three years
to six because <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> are no longer aligned as ideally as
they were in <DATE>1986</DATE> and because <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s new solid-fueled booster is
less powerful.
   The launch delay and longer flight time prompted a decision to
take the probe apart for refurbishing and to make sure some parts
wouldn't fail because of aging.
   <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> approval for the launch is expected in <DATE>September</DATE>,
said <PERSON>Richard Spehalski</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> project manager at <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION>. Such
approval is needed because the probe and orbiter each carry a power
plant and heater containing radioactive plutonium. A <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
environmental impact statement concluded last month that the risk of
a nuclear accident when the shuttle lifts off with <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is very
small.

   Here are key events for the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>
spacecraft's looping, six-year trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the solar system's
largest planet:
   <DATE>Oct. 18, 1989</DATE> _ <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is released from the cargo bay of space
shuttle Atlantis, then an <ORGANIZATION>Inertial Upper Stage</ORGANIZATION> booster launches the
spacecraft on its long voyage.
   <DATE>Nov. 9-11, 1989</DATE> _ Controllers order multiple firings of
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s thrusters for the first of about 30 course correction
maneuvers.
   <DATE>Dec. 22, 1989</DATE> _ Thrusters fire again for second course
correction.
   <DATE>Feb. 9, 1990</DATE> _ <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> swoops near <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> for its first ``gravity
assist'' maneuver, using the planet's gravity to increase the
spacecraft's speed to help it reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> makes photos
and measurements of Venus, storing them on an onboard recorder.
   Late <DATE>October 1990</DATE> _ <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> plays back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> the photos and
measurements it made near <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>.
   <DATE>Dec. 8, 1990</DATE> _ <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> passes within 600 miles of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, making
photos and measurements during its second ``gravity assist''
maneuver, which will help aim it toward <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   <DATE>Oct. 29, 1991</DATE> _ The spacecraft swoops within 600 miles of
asteroid Gaspra, taking pictures and measurements.
   <DATE>Dec. 8, 1992</DATE> _ <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> zooms about 185 miles above <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s
surface in the third and final ``gravity assist'' maneuver needed
to hurl it toward <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   <DATE>Aug. 28, 1993</DATE> _ If <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> has adequate propellant supplies, it
passes 600 miles from asteroid Ida for photos and measurements.
   <DATE>July 1995</DATE> _ The spacecraft separates into a 760-pound <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>
probe and a 4,890-pound <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> orbiter. Both continue toward
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   <DATE>Dec. 7, 1995</DATE> _ The probe and orbiter arrive at <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. The
probe plunges into the planet's atmosphere, relaying measurements
to the orbiter, then is destroyed by intense atmospheric pressure.
The orbiter speeds about 600 miles from the moon Io and its
sulfur-spewing volcanoes and geysers, then goes into orbit around
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   <DATE>December 1995-October 1997</DATE> _ The orbiter circles <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, making
photos and measurements of the giant planet and the moons <LOCATION>Europa</LOCATION>,

<HEAD>Spacecraft Snaps More Venus Pictures After Glitch is Fixed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> space ship cruised on the
next leg of its 2.4-billion mile, six-year trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> after
engineers replaced faulty computer commands that made the craft act
like a mad shutterbug.
   Galileo snapped 16 planned photos of Venus on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, but for
about five hours the shutter on the spacecraft's electronic camera
opened and closed 452 times when it wasn't supposed to do so. None
of those unintended exposures were recorded.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers sent the 2.8-ton <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> new computer commands
late <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, and the camera was able to snap 38 pictures, right
on schedule, of cloud-shrouded Venus in a series that ended <DATE>Sunday</DATE>
<TIME>morning</TIME>.
   ``They seem to understand what happened, and they're not
concerned about any repeats,'' said <PERSON>Bob MacMillin</PERSON>, spokesman for
the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is now flying back toward Earth so the planet can act as
a gravity slingshot on <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE> to help the spacecraft reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>
in <DATE>1995</DATE> in a <MONEY>$1.35 billion</MONEY> mission to explore the solar system's
largest planet.
   Galileo swooped about 10,000 miles above the 900-degree
Fahrenheit surface of Venus at <TIME>9:59 p.m. PST</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE> in the
mission's first ``gravity assist maneuver.'' Venus helped increase
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s speed by almost 5,000 mph, giving it enough energy to get
to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   After the flyby, the spacecraft took 16 pictures to study
Venusian cloud and wind patterns and look for lightning. The camera
bugs then developed.
   MacMillin said engineers determined <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s camera and
computer were fine, and that the problem was in a computer program
sent from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> to tell <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> what to do and when to do it.
   The problem was caused by improper timing between various
commands within the computer program, <PERSON>MacMillin</PERSON> said.
   He said such problems are not unusual on a spacecraft as new as
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>. The craft was deployed <DATE>Oct. 18</DATE> from the cargo bay of space
shuttle Atlantis, then launched by a solid-fueled booster to start
its looping 2.4-billion-mile, six-year trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   The spacecraft was programmed to continue looking back at Venus
until late this <DATE>Friday</DATE>, taking 27 more photos and using other
sensors to detect dust, infrared and visible light, and
electrically charged particles.
   The pictures and measurements are stored on the spacecraft's
tape recorder. Almost all of them will be sent back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in
<DATE>October</DATE> when <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is close enough to send scientific information
using its small antenna.
   That antenna now can be used only to help run the spacecraft. A
large antenna currently is furled to protect it from the sun's heat.
   After swinging past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in <DATE>December</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will explore
asteroid Gaspra in <DATE>October 1991</DATE>, then make another flight past
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> on <DATE>Dec. 8, 1992</DATE>. The spacecraft may study asteroid Ida in
<DATE>August 1993</DATE> before <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> deploys a 760-pound probe in <DATE>July 1995</DATE>.
Galileo and the probe will reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>December 1995</DATE>.
   The probe will parachute into the planet's atmosphere, relaying
measurements to <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> until it is vaporized by intense heat and
pressure. <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will swoop past the moon Io and its
sulfur-spewing volcanoes, then go into orbit around <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> to
study the planet and moons <LOCATION>Europa</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Callisto</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Ganymede</LOCATION> at least
until late <DATE>1997</DATE>.

<TEXT>
<P>
The shuttle Atlantis roared into space <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> on the first leg of the most 
ambitious planetary mission to date. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>, the most sophisticated unmanned spacecraft ever built, was released 
from the shuttle's cargo bay six hours after the <TIME>9:53 a.m. PDT launching</TIME> and is 
finally on its way to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. It was a launching that some scientists were 
beginning to think they might never see. 
</P>
<P>
The spectacular liftoff, which had been delayed several times, marked both a 
beginning and an end. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the end of years of frustration for scientists and engineers who 
built the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> and then watched it narrowly escape the scrap heap several 
times. 
</P>
<P>
"It was definitely a special day for them," launch director <PERSON>Robert Sieck</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was worth the wait," said <PERSON>Richard Young</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Ames Research Center</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Mountain View</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, one of the principal scientists on the project. "It was 
fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
Atlantis commander <PERSON>Donald E. Williams</PERSON>, 47, could not have agreed more. "We're 
happy to be here," he said as the shuttle orbited 184 miles above <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
And the launching signaled the beginning of what promises to be a spectacular 
journey through space. It will take six years for <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> to reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the 
largest planet in the solar system; but, along the way, the spacecraft will 
tour the inner solar system and its camera will even offer humans their first 
view of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> as it would be seen by visitors from outer space. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials considered scrapping the <MONEY>$1.4-billion</MONEY> project as 
the space agency struggled to rebuild after the Challenger explosion. 
Scientists who had invested much of their careers in the project held their 
breaths as <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> reevaluated the mission. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo had been designed to be put into low Earth orbit by the shuttle and 
then use a liquid-fueled engine to blast itself on to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. But, because of 
concerns about safety after the Challenger disaster, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> decided to prohibit 
liquid fuel in the shuttle's cargo bay, leaving <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> with a great itinerary 
but no way to travel. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was saved when engineers at the <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> came up with 
a way of getting the spacecraft to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> without using liquid fuel. It could 
be done, they concluded, by using a safer solid rocket motor to push <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> 
beyond <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s grasp. 
</P>
<P>
The solid rocket is not powerful enough to give <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> the speed it will need 
to reach the outer solar system, so <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will have to take the scenic back 
roads to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
After <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was released from the shuttle's cargo bay, it used its rocket to 
slow itself down as it sped around <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The reduced speed left <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> falling toward the sun. But, in <DATE>February</DATE>, 
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will pass close enough to Venus to use that planet's gravity to change 
its course. Venus will swing <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> around and throw it back toward <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>December of 1990</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will come within 600 miles of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, whipping 
around its home base for the first time and using <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s gravity to slingshot 
itself through the asteroid belt outside of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s orbit. Ten months later, 
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is to pass within about 600 miles of the asteroid Gaspra for the first 
encounter with an asteroid, snapping pictures and studying this remnant of the 
early solar system. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>December of 1992</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will make a daringly close approach to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, 
passing within about 185 miles and using the planet's gravity to boost its 
speed by 8,000 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, that should give <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> the speed it will need to reach 
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
It is the second encounter with Earth that most worries anti-nuclear 
protesters, who tried to block the launching. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo carries about 48 pounds of toxic plutonium 238, which it uses to 
generate electricity to run its many instruments. The protesters, who had also 
feared a launching disaster, worry that, if <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> accidentally plunges down 
into <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere during that close flyby, the plutonium -- which is in a 
solid, ceramic form and packaged in steel canisters -- could somehow be 
vaporized and spread around the world. 
</P>
<P>
That would require multiple failures, which <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> judged to be highly unlikely. 
In the end, the courts ruled for <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>, and protesters did not try to physically 
disrupt <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s launching. 
</P>
<P>
Although <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will send data back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> during its entire journey, the 
most important payday will occur when the three-ton spacecraft, carrying a 
total of 16 scientific instruments, encounters <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will loop 
around <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and its moons for two years, capturing close-up pictures of the 
planet and its moons with a high-resolution camera that will make the images 
from the Voyager spacecraft look like snapshots. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 days before <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> reaches <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the spacecraft will release a 
probe designed to plunge into the gaseous planet's heart, sending back data 
until it is crushed by the dense layers of gas. 
</P>
<P>
Atlantis is scheduled to land at <ORGANIZATION>Edwards Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> 
on <DATE>Monday</DATE> at <TIME>12:39 p.m</TIME>. The shuttle's pilot is <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON>Michael J. McCulley</PERSON>. 
Other members of the crew are <PERSON>Shannon W. Lucid</PERSON>, <PERSON>Franklin Chang-Diaz</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ellen 
S. Baker</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RETURN TO <ORGANIZATION>JUPITER</ORGANIZATION> 
</P>
<P>
After a flight lasting six years, the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe will separate into two 
parts as it approaches <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. The orbiter section will circle the planet for 
at least 22 months. The probe capsule will descend into the planet's atmosphere 
and make direct measurements until it is destroyed by the high-pressure gases 
there. 
</P>
<P>
GALILEO'S FLIGHT PATH 
</P>
<P>
The spacecraft was originally designed to make a 2 1/2-year direct flight to 
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. Changes after the Challenger disaster resulted in a six-year flight 
path using flybys of the planets <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and Earth to build up enough speed to 
reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Voyager 1 Appears Successful in Snapping Family Portrait of
Planets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Voyager 1 spacecraft sent radio
signals to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> today indicating it successfully snapped pictures
of most of the planets to create the first family portrait of the
solar system, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   ``Engineering data we received show the proper commands were
executed. It looks like the pictures were taken properly,'' said
<PERSON>Mary Hardin</PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Voyager 1, which photographed <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>1981</DATE>, was ordered to snap the photographs between <TIME>5:12 p.m.</TIME> and
<TIME>9:20 p.m. PST</TIME> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, but it took five hours and 36 minutes for
signals confirming the commands were executed to travel the 3.7
billion miles to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Hardin</PERSON> said.
   The space probe took the pictures from a vantage point 32
degrees above the plane extending from the sun's equator. The
planets orbit the sun roughly within that plane.
   Because no other spacecraft has been in such a position or will
be there within coming decades, ``this is probably the first time
and last time in our lifetimes we'll be able to take such a
picture,'' <PERSON>Hardin</PERSON> said. ``It's historic. It will give us a
perspective on our world and universe we've never had before.''
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials have said that when the photographs are assembled
into a montage for display on a wall, the planets will appear only
as tiny dots separated by vast empty spaces and spreading ovr 100
feet or more.
   Instructions to take the pictures were transmitted to the
spacecraft's computer on <DATE>Jan. 15</DATE>, with more detailed orders issued
<DATE>Feb. 2</DATE>.
   Because of other demands on <ORGANIZATION>NASA Deep Space Tracking Antennas</ORGANIZATION>,
the photos won't be sent back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> until late <DATE>March</DATE>. It will be
late <DATE>April</DATE> before the images can be processed.
   The sun and seven of the solar system's nine planets are
expected to appear as points of light against a starry backdrop,
<ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> officials said.
   Mercury, the innermost planet, will be too close to the sun to
be distinguished by <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s cameras and <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION> is too far away and
too small to show up in images.

   Seven months into its six-year, <MONEY>$1.35
billion</MONEY> journey to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft ignited its
rocket thrusters repeatedly so it can swoop near <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in <DATE>December</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The tiny rocket thrusters were ordered to fire during a two-day
maneuver that ends late today, said <PERSON>Jim Wilson</PERSON>, a spokesman at the
<ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   ``We are changing both the speed and the aim point for our Earth
flyby. It's a very gradual change,'' mission director <PERSON>Neal Ausman</PERSON>
said <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   On <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will swoop past Earth in a gravity slingshot
maneuver designed to help expand the spacecraft's orbit around the
sun and hurl it toward its <DATE>1995</DATE> rendezvous with <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the solar
system's largest planet.
   The spacecraft will study <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> during the flyby and again
during another slingshot maneuver in <DATE>December 1992</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> used
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON> as a gravity slingshot <DATE>Feb. 9</DATE>.
   When the maneuver started at <TIME>11:10 a.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was
96 million miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, but had traveled a looping path of 365
million miles since it was launched from space shuttle Atlantis
last <DATE>Oct. 18</DATE>, <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> said.
   Its trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the fifth planet from the sun, will total
2.4 billion miles.
   The <MONEY>$1.35 billion</MONEY> mission will take <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> past one asteroid in
<DATE>1991</DATE> and perhaps another in <DATE>1993</DATE>. In <DATE>July 1995</DATE>, the spacecraft
separates into a 4,890-pound orbiter and a 760-pound probe. They
are scheduled to reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Dec. 7, 1995</DATE>.
   The probe will plunge into the planet's atmosphere, relaying
measurements to the orbiter until it is destroyed by intense
atmospheric pressure. The orbiter will spend at least two years
studying and taking snapshots of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and its major moons Io,
<LOCATION>Europa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ganymede</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Callisto</ORGANIZATION>.
   One or two more trajectory maneuvers are needed to get <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>
to swoop about 1,000 miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in <DATE>December</DATE>, <PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said.
Without the maneuvers, the spacecraft would miss Earth by 1.5
million miles.

<HEAD>Probe to Pluto Could Be Piggybacked on Solar Mission, NASA Engineer
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineer has proposed a relatively
quick, cheap way to send a spacecraft to <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>, the only unexplored
planet in the solar system.
   <PERSON>Robert Farquhar</PERSON>, who manages the small missions program at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
headquarters in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, said a rocket designed to send a probe
to the sun also could hurl an unmanned spaceship to <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>.
   ``It's a free ride,'' he said in an interview in <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s <LOCATION>Los
Angeles</LOCATION> Times.
   Voyager 2's flight past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> <DATE>last week</DATE> leaves <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION> the only
planet unvisited by a spacecraft from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. There are no plans for
a <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION> mission, and such a flight won't be financially feasible for
decades, officials of the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION> have said.
   <PERSON>Farquhar</PERSON>, who masterminded the flight of the first spacecraft to
visit a comet, said his proposal would allow a probe to be launched
toward <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION> within about a dozen years and for less than <MONEY>$150
million</MONEY>. That's cheap compared with the twin-spacecraft Voyager
mission that visited four planets for <MONEY>$865 million</MONEY>.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> plans to send a probe through the sun's searing atmosphere
right after the turn of the century.
   To approach the sun at an angle that would allow scientists to
monitor the probe throughout its flight, it first would have to be
carried around <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Farquhar</PERSON> said a lightweight <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION> probe could be carried on the
same Titan rocket. Once they reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the probes would part
for their respective targets. The <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION> probe, given a boost by
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s gravity, would reach <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION> around <DATE>2014</DATE>.
   Pluto normally is the ninth and most distant planet from the sun.
But <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> now is temporarily in that position because of <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>'s
elongated elliptical orbit.
   <PERSON>Farquhar</PERSON>'s proposal is ``a very interesting possibility,'' said
physicist <PERSON>Bruce Tsurutani</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
<LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>, who is planning the solar probe. Tsurutani said <PERSON>Farquhar</PERSON>'s
proposal should receive strong consideration.
   Physicist <PERSON>Alan Stern</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>University of Colorado</ORGANIZATION> expert on <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>,
said the proposal is feasible. He suggested that any joint
solar-Pluto mission be named ``Fire and Ice.''
   If <PERSON>Farquhar</PERSON>'s proposal is accepted, it won't be the first time
one of his ideas gains favor. Farquhar and the late <PERSON>Fred Scarf</PERSON>, a
physicist with <ORGANIZATION>TRW Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Redondo Beach</LOCATION>, persuaded <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> a few years
ago to redirect an aging spacecraft toward comet Giacobini-Zinner.
   The International Sun-Explorer 3, which had finished its main
mission of studying the solar wind, was renamed the <ORGANIZATION>International
Cometary Explorer</ORGANIZATION> and became the first to visit a comet. The probe
arrived at Giacobini-Zinner in <DATE>1985</DATE>, just before five European and
Japanese spacecraft visited <PERSON>Halley</PERSON>'s comet in <DATE>1986</DATE>,
   <PERSON>Farquhar</PERSON> said he devised his <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION> proposal while examining plans
for the solar probe. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> has made that probe a high-priority
mission because the sun has been relatively neglected in space
exploration.
   Under <PERSON>Farquhar</PERSON>'s proposal, the <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION> probe would contain a
camera, a dust counter, an instrument to study the planet's
atmosphere and radio gear for communication and other studies. The
spacecraft also might send a package of instruments to <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>'s
surface as it darted past the planet.

<HEAD>Voyager 2 Finds Giant `Dark Spot' On Neptune; May Be Huge Storm</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Voyager 2 spacecraft has discovered a
6,200-mile-wide dark spot on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, and scientists believe it's a
giant storm similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s hurricanes and <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red
Spot.
   The width is about one-fifth of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s 30,700-mile diameter,
just as the 16,000-mile-wide Great Red Spot is about one-fifth the
size of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON>Andrew Ingersoll</PERSON>, a planetary scientist at the
<ORGANIZATION>California Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>.
   Voyager 2 was launched from <LOCATION>Cape Canaveral</LOCATION> in <DATE>1977</DATE>, visited
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>. Its twin,
Voyager 1, explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE>, and is now
heading toward interplanetary space.
   ``I had gotten sort of discouraged from the Uranus encounter
because Uranus was such a bland place,'' <ORGANIZATION>Ingersoll</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Monday</DATE>. ``So
I'm happy to see such action on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.''
   The top Voyager scientist was similarly excited.
   ``It's huge!'' Caltech physicist and vice president <ORGANIZATION>Edward Stone</ORGANIZATION>
said of the dark spot.
   While the robot probe is too far from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> to detect winds
within the spot, the spot seems to be a hurricane-like storm system
similar to the Great Red Spot, which has 250 mph winds, said Stone,
chief scientist of the Voyager project for the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics
and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>.
   Hurricanes on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> are much smaller, measuring several hundred
miles across. Unlike Earth's hurricanes, which break up after a week
or two, <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot has remained intact at least since
its discovery more than 350 years ago _ a mystery scientists have
yet to explain.
   Stone said <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s dark spot became apparent in photographs
taken by <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s television cameras in <DATE>April</DATE>, and faint hints of
it can be seen in pictures made as early as <DATE>January</DATE>.
   The absence of continents on giant gas planets such as <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>
and <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> may explain the persistence of the spots, <ORGANIZATION>Ingersoll</ORGANIZATION>
said, adding that continents may help dissipate hurricanes on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Voyager 2 is due to make its closest approach to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, the
solar system's fourth-largest planet, at <TIME>9 p.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Aug. 24</DATE>.
   It will swoop 3,000 miles from the planet's north pole, by far
the closest approach of any of the flybys during the spacecraft's
``grand tour'' of the giant, gaseous outer planets. Five hours
later, it will pass 25,000 miles from <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, one of two known
Neptunian moons.
   Voyager 2 <DATE>today</DATE> was 2.66 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 58.98
million miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, speeding toward that planet at 42,216
mph, said <PERSON>Mary Beth Murrill</PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s dark spot is about 25 to 30 degrees latitude in the
planet's southern hemisphere, <ORGANIZATION>Ingersoll</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Voyager 2 also discovered a much smaller, rapidly changing white
spot _ about half the size of the dark spot _ at about 70 degrees
south latitude, he said.
   The dark spot's color isn't yet known because scientists haven't
processed a complete set of pictures through different color
filters, <ORGANIZATION>Ingersoll</ORGANIZATION> said. But Stone said it is darker than <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
surrounding skies, which are blue-green because of methane in its
mostly hydrogen-helium atmosphere.
   <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot is believed to get its color from
organic chemicals or possibly sulfur or phosphorus trapped within
it, said Ingersoll.
   Besides the Great Red Spot, <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> contains dozens of smaller
storm systems, which appear as white spots. <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> has similar
storms, although they are less visible, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Computer simulations suggest smaller storms combine to form giant
storms such as the Red Spot and <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s dark spot, the scientists
said.
   The existence of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s dark spot is mysterious because
scientists didn't think the planet had enough heat to drive fierce
winds, said Ingersoll. Unlike <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, Uranus
lacks enough internal heat to create big storms, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Neptune usually is the eighth planet from the sun, and is about
30 times farther from the sun than <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. But because <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>'s
elongated elliptical orbit sometimes brings it closer to the sun,
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> will be the ninth and most distant planet from the sun until
the year <DATE>2007</DATE>.

   The Voyager 2 spacecraft, flying through
space 2.6 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, fired its thrusters <DATE>Friday</DATE> to
change course for its <DATE>August 1989</DATE> picture-taking encounter with the
planet <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   ``Responding to radio signals radioed from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, Voyager 2 fired
its hydrazine thrusters for three minutes and 29 seconds beginning
at <TIME>6:55 a.m. PST</TIME>,'' said a statement issued by the space agency's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Flight engineering manager <PERSON>Lanny Miller</PERSON> said radio signals sent
to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> by the space probe indicated the maneuver succeeded.
   The pre-planned course correction will bring Voyager 2 some 6,200
miles closer to the solar system's eighth planet, but another major
maneuver next <DATE>April</DATE> and several subsequent but minor trajectory
changes will be required before the <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> flyby, said laboratory
spokeswoman <PERSON>Mary Beth Murrill</PERSON>.
   The spacecraft _ which passed by <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE>
and Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE> _ is scheduled to sweep within 3,000 miles of
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s cloud tops at <TIME>9 p.m. PDT</TIME> next <DATE>Aug. 24</DATE>, taking pictures
with its television camera.
   Five hours later, it will fly within 24,000 miles of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
moon <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, which scientists believe may have lakes of liquid
nitrogen.
   <PERSON>Murrill</PERSON> said Voyager 2 is 414.7 million miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, one
of the solar system's giant, gaseous outer planets.
   Radio commands to the probe and its response signals are
transmitted through large, dish-shaped radio antennae that make up
the Deep Space Network operated by the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and
Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Goldstone</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.
   Voyager 2 is so far away that the signals take four hours to
reach it, even traveling at the speed of light.
   The <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> encounter will be the last of the so-called ``grand
tour'' of the outer planets by the Voyager probes. Voyagers 1 and 2
were launched from <LOCATION>Cape Canaveral</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1977</DATE>. Voyager 1, which
visited <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE>, now is headed out of the
solar system.
   Scientists have called the Voyager mission humanity's most
productive space exploration effort because the two picture-taking
probes learned hundreds of times more about the outer planets than
all previous studies combined.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> scientists have said that by <DATE>1995</DATE>, when both probes are
searching for the edge of the solar system, the total cost of the
mission will be about <MONEY>$920 million</MONEY>, which is less than half what the
<ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> spends during one workday.
   Among key Voyager discoveries were active volcanos spewing sulfur
on <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s moon Io, an icy volcanism that produced glacier-like
flows on some of the Saturnian and Uranian moons, and the discovery
of at least 17 previously unknown moons: three at <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, at least
four at <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and 10 orbiting Uranus.
   The probes also discovered new rings encircling <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>
and Uranus; orange smog and ethane-methane rain on <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>'s moon
<ORGANIZATION>Titan</ORGANIZATION>, and dozens of giant hurricanes on <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Magnetic Field Around Neptune Discovered By Voyager 2</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Voyager 2 space probe discovered that
a magnetic field surrounds <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, suggesting the planet is
enveloped by orbiting radiation belts and has an aurora like <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s
northern lights, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> announced <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   Further study of the magnetic field should allow scientists to
determine the exact length of a day on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, believed to be 17 to
18 Earth hours, and to gain better understanding of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
internal structure, said <PERSON>Mary Beth Murrill</PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Just as <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s magnetic field traps the Van <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> radiation
belts, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s magnetic field also may help create radiation belts
around that planet. Scientists don't yet know if that poses a hazard
to Voyager 2's electronic components, <PERSON>Murrill</PERSON> said.
   Voyager was 2.74 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 5.92 million miles
from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, speeding toward the giant gas planet at
42,236 mph.
   The spacecraft was launched in <DATE>1977</DATE> and explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>. Voyager 2 will make its closest
approach to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> at <TIME>8:59 p.m. PDT</TIME> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> when it flies about
3,000 miles over the cloudtops of the solar system's fourth-largest
planet.
   Voyager already has discovered four Neptunian moons in addition
to the two discovered from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, two partial rings, or ring arcs,
of debris orbiting the planet; and atmospheric patterns similar to
jet streams and giant cyclones on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Discovery of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s magnetic field was confirmed <DATE>Friday</DATE> by
intense, pulse-like radio emissions coming from the planet's
vicinity. Radio waves are generated when high-speed electrically
charged particles spiral into a planet's atmosphere along magnetic
field lines.
   ``Mercury, <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus have magnetic
fields, while <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and Mars do not,'' the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and
Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> said in a news release. ``Whether <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION> has one
or not is unknown.
   ``A planetary magnetic field is a girdle of magnetic field lines
that surround a planet,'' the agency said. ``Such fields are thought
to be generated by fluid motion in a planet's core. (<ORGANIZATION>Molten</ORGANIZATION> iron in
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s core, for example).''
   Certain electrically charged particles in space spiral along
magnetic field lines toward <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s poles, creating the northern and
southern lights. A magnetic field at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> means that planet also
may have auroras, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Scientists hope the magnetic field will allow them to understand
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s internal structure. Voyager project scientist <ORGANIZATION>Edward Stone</ORGANIZATION>
has said he believes that <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s hydrogen-helium outer atmosphere
gradually gives way to a superhot slurry of hot water and rock
closer to the planet's center. That would mean that <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> _ like
neighboring Uranus _ probably lacks a distinct sky-sea boundary.
   Some scientists believe radiation trapped by Uranus' magnetic
field bombards frozen natural gas on that planet's moons and rings
to turn them dark in color. Neptune's magnetic field may cause
similar radiation darkening of the Neptunian moons and ring arcs,
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The nature of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s radio signal allowed scientists to
determine the emissions came from a magnetic field, not from
discharges of lightning in the atmosphere, said <PERSON>James Warwick</PERSON>, head
of Voyager's radio science team.
   ``The radio emissions are very intense, very impulsive and occur
in a limited range of frequency,'' <PERSON>Warwick</PERSON>, a scientist at <LOCATION>Boulder</LOCATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Colo.-based Radiophysics Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, said in the release.
   Once <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> confirmed the existence of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s magnetic field
<DATE>Friday</DATE>, scientists found evidence for the telltale radio signals in
data collected by Voyager as early as <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   ``Early analysis indicates <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s magnetic field is of an
intensity similar to the fields of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and Uranus,'' <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   <PERSON>Murrill</PERSON> said scientists don't yet know how <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s magnetic
field is aligned. Voyager found the axis of Uranus' magnetic field
was tilted about 60 degrees from the axis around which that planet
spins.
   Earth's north magnetic pole is tilted about 14 degrees from the
planet's north rotational axis.

   The <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft, looping through
the solar system on the way to its <DATE>1995</DATE> exploration of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>,
fired its thrusters today in a major maneuver meant to steer it
near <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> late this year.
   ``We're trying to reshape the trajectory slightly so we move
closer and closer to our aim point near <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> on <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE>,'' said
<PERSON>Neal Ausman</PERSON>, mission director at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s tiny rocket thrusters, which are small enough to fit
in the palm of a hand, started firing at <TIME>11:10 a.m. PDT</TIME> and will
fire roughly 3,000 times by the time the maneuver ends <DATE>Saturday</DATE>
<TIME>afternoon</TIME>, laboratory spokesman <PERSON>Jim Wilson</PERSON> said.
   The two-day maneuver will slow the spacecraft, which was
traveling about 66,000 mph earlier today, by about 25 mph. It also
will gradually alter its direction, <PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said.
   It is the second of three or four maneuvers needed to bring
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> within 1,000 miles of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, which will act as a gravity
slingshot to help expand the spacecraft's orbit around the sun and
propel it toward <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, he added. Without maneuvers, the
spacecraft would miss Earth by 1.5 million miles.
   As of today, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was 96 million miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, but has
traveled a looping path of 365 million miles since it was launched
from space shuttle Atlantis last <DATE>Oct. 18</DATE>. Its trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> will
total 2.4 billion miles.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will make a second swing past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in <DATE>December 1992</DATE>. It
flew past <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> in another gravity slingshot maneuver on <DATE>Feb. 9</DATE>.
   In <DATE>July 1995</DATE>, the spacecraft separates into a 4,890-pound
orbiter and a 760-pound probe. They are scheduled to reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>,
the solar system's largest planet, on <DATE>Dec. 7, 1995</DATE>.
   The probe will plunge into the planet's atmosphere, relaying
measurements to the orbiter before the probe is destroyed by
intense atmospheric pressure. The orbiter will spend at least two
years studying and taking snapshots of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and its major moons
Europa, <LOCATION>Ganymede</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Callisto</ORGANIZATION>.

   Neptune's icy volcanic moon <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> is the
coldest body ever measured in the solar system, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Monday</DATE>,
and the planet itself has something in common with <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>: smog.
   The Voyager 2 space probe also discovered auroras vaguely like
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s northern lights on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, scientists said.
   Looking backward 3.2 million miles, Voyager 2 on <DATE>Monday</DATE> snapped a
series of family portraits of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, appearing as
crescents as they were backlighted by the sun.
   Earlier, Voyager 2's ultraviolet detector determined that
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s surface temperature is 400 degrees below zero Fahrenheit,
making the moon ``the coldest body we have seen in the solar
system,'' said <PERSON>Roger Yelle</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Arizona</ORGANIZATION>.
   Scientists believe <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION> and its moon <PERSON>Charon</PERSON> are the
second-coldest bodies in the solar system.
   In another finding, the best close-up photo yet of another moon,
<DATE>1989</DATE> N1, showed that <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s second-largest moon has a huge crater
about half as wide as the lumpy-looking, 240-mile-wide satellite.
   That indicates that a big meteorite once smacked into <DATE>1989</DATE> N1,
one of six moons discovered since <DATE>June</DATE> by <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>, according to
<PERSON>Bradford Smith</PERSON>, the leader of <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s photographic imaging team.
   Voyager also sent back heat measurements to help scientists find
liquid lakes or oceans on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, but the moon almost certainly is
too cold to have them, said <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>, a scientist at the
<ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory here.
   Johnson defended the theory, advanced by other scientists <DATE>Sunday</DATE>,
that <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> has active volcanoes that erupt nitrogen ice particles
20 miles skyward. ``It isn't a crazy idea,'' he said.
   Voyager's close encounter with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> occurred <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>
and it passed <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, capping its epic tour of the four
outer planets, including <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus.
   The probe has also found five rings, including three thin ones
and two broad bands of dust.
   1989 N1 took <ORGANIZATION>Nereid</ORGANIZATION>'s place as <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s second-largest moon
after <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>. N1 and the other five moons discovered by Voyager in
addition to <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Nereid</LOCATION>, which were discovered from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,
have not yet been permanently named.
   The latest data returned by Voyager's ultraviolet light sensor
revealed auroras somewhat like <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s northern and southern lights
over wide sections of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s skies and over much of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s day
side, said Yelle.
   But unlike <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s auroras, which glow in visible light as
electrically charged particles excite nitrogen and oxygen gases, the
auroras on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> are invisible to the human eye. That's
because they glow in ultraviolet light caused when the particles
excite hydrogen gas.
   Sunlight hitting natural gas, or methane, high in <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
atmosphere ``converts it into photochemical smog'' that forms a
90-mile-thick icy layer at the bottom of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s stratosphere,
said <PERSON>Jim Pollock</PERSON>, an imaging team member from <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Ames Research
Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Mountain View</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said smog on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> have ``definite
similarities,'' although <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> smog has components absent on
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   Finding smog on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> ``is no surprise,'' <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said.
``Photochemical smog exists any place (planet or moon) we've been
that has an atmosphere. In <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, the problem is it's
happening way down low where we have to breathe it in amounts
exceeding anything we've seen except on Titan,'' <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>'s smoggy
moon.
   Auroras on planets are caused when electrically charged particles
from the solar wind spiral toward a planet's magnetic poles along
magnetic field lines. On Earth, the magnetic poles are tilted only
12 degrees away from the poles around which the planet rotates, so
auroras appear as northern and southern lights in polar regions.
   Neptune's major magnetic poles are tilted 50 degrees away from
its rotational poles, and scientists have said the planet may have
multiple magnetic poles. That could explain why <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s auroras
appear over wide areas of the planet.
   <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s aurora is created differently. Electrically charged
particles in <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s orbiting radiation belt, discovered recently
by <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>, excite gases in <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere to create its
auroras, said <PERSON>Andy Chen</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Johns Hopkins University</ORGANIZATION>.
   By <TIME>9 a.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, Voyager will be 2.759 billion miles from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 4.097 million miles beyond <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, slowly decelerating as
it speeds toward the stars at 37,582 mph.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers are investigating the feasibility of reprogramming
Voyager to take a snapshot of the entire solar system sometime in
the coming months, said <PERSON>Lanny Miller</PERSON>, manager of the flight
engineering office.

   Pioneer 10, the little spacecraft
that won't quit, is still searching for a 10th planet five years
after leaving the known solar system and 16 years after leaving the
launch pad, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> scientists said <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   Disturbances in the orbits of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and Uranus suggest that a
mysterious Planet X may be orbiting beyond <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>, <PERSON>John D. Anderson</PERSON>
of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> said as <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> observed the <DATE>fifth
anniversary of Pioneer 10</DATE>'s dash past <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>'s orbit.
   Pioneer 10, launched in <DATE>1972</DATE> and now over 4 billion miles from
home even though it was guaranteed for only 21 months, also is
searching for long gravity waves proposed by <PERSON>Albert Einstein</PERSON>, and
the boundary of the sun's influence.
   The radio signals the 570-pound space probe is sending back _
from 45 times the distance between the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and the sun _ aren't
very powerful and take six hours to get here at the speed of light.
But they are important to researchers trying to solve some
classical puzzles about the universe.
   The energy of the craft's signals picked up by a 70-meter deep
space antenna would have to be accumulated for over <MONEY>11 billion</MONEY>
years to build up enough energy to light a 7{-watt nightlight for
one millisecond, said <PERSON>Richard O. Fimmel</PERSON>, project manager at the
<ORGANIZATION>NASA Ames Research Center</ORGANIZATION>.
   But the signals from Pioneer 10 and its twin, Pioneer 11,
launched in <DATE>1973</DATE>, are strong enough to send ``high quality data on
a daily basis,'' said physicist <PERSON>James Van Allen</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University
of Iowa</ORGANIZATION>, a principal investigator on the Pioneer project.
   Van <PERSON>Allen</PERSON>, who discovered the radiation belts surrounding <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,
said Pioneer 10 has literally and figuratively gone far beyond its
original missions to study <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and the asteroid belt between
Mars and <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``One of the principal current objectives is the observation of
cosmic rays and the flow of the solar wind at heretofore unexplored
distances from the sun,'' Van <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> said.
   ``We now have a realistic expectation of finding the outer
boundary of the heliosphere, which is the sphere of influence of
the sun, and of penetrating into the nearby interstellar media,''
he said.
   But sadly, he said, Pioneer 10 may stop working before it
reaches the edge of the heliosphere.
   The tiny craft is expected to operate only another seven to 10
years, <PERSON>Fimmel</PERSON> said, and may run out of energy before it reaches
interstellar space.
   Before that, however, Pioneer 10 may give scientists clues to
the shape of the heliosphere.
   And it is relaying strong evidence suggesting Planet X or
possibly two smaller unknown planets exist.
   ``We have a 90 to <PERCENT>99 percent</PERCENT> confidence that Uranus and <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
are being disturbed, and one candidate for that is a single Planet
X,'' said <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON>. ``It's conceivable there could be other
gravitational effects on the two orbits.
   ``We haven't ruled out other matter which could be in orbit
around the sun,'' he said. ``It could be small particulate matter.
It could be more than one planet that are very small. The best
hypothesis is a single planet X at one to four <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> masses.''
   Such a planet, he said, would likely be a mixture of ice and
rock.
   Pioneer 10 made its closest approach to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> _ 82,000 miles _
on <DATE>Dec. 3, 1973</DATE>, 21 months after it was launched, after traveling
an arc-shaped 620 million-mile path from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   It was the first spacecraft to cross the Asteroid Belt, fly past
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and return pictures, chart <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s intense radiation
belts, measure the mass of its four planet-sized moons, and
discover that <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> is predominantly a liquid planet.
   Pioneer 11 encountered <DATE>Jupiter a year later</DATE>, then reached <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>
on <DATE>Sept. 1, 1979</DATE>.
   Both craft, though partly damaged along the way, far exceeded
their operations guarantee of at least 21 months. A spokesman for
<ORGANIZATION>TRW Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Redondo Beach</LOCATION> joked <DATE>Monday</DATE> that the company would fix
anything wrong with the two Pioneers if <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> could bring them back.

   The far side of the moon, last
photographed by Apollo astronauts two decades ago, was captured on
film again by the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft when it zoomed past the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
on its long voyage to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``It's staggering to realize we've been neglecting our own
satellite,'' said <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s chief scientist at
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Astronauts with the 1969-1972 Apollo lunar missions photographed
the back side of the moon, but <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> the last good
pictures before <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> were made by unmanned lunar orbiters during
the <DATE>1960s</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> passed the moon after it swooped 597 miles above the
southwest <LOCATION>Atlantic Ocean</LOCATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. It used <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s gravity as a
slingshot to help expand the spacecraft's orbit around the sun so
it can reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1995</DATE>. It used <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> for the same purpose
last <DATE>February</DATE> and will fly past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> again in <DATE>December 1992</DATE>.
   The planetary encounters are meant solely to help propel <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>
on its <MONEY>$1.4 billion</MONEY> mission to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. But scientists took the
opportunity to use the spacecraft to study <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in dress
rehearsals for exploring <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Three of <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s new photographs of the moon and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> were
released <DATE>Thursday</DATE> by the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION> as <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> zoomed away from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, snapping more
pictures of its home planet from a distance of 2.33 million miles.
   One photo shows the crescent moon, while another shows <PERSON>Mare
Orientale</PERSON>, a 550-mile-wide meteorite impact crater on the far side
of the moon, which is always pointed away from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Because of
the way the moon orbits <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, only five-eighths of its surface can
be seen from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s third picture shows half of <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>, including the
<ORGANIZATION>Ross Ice Shelf</ORGANIZATION> and mountains poking through ice near <LOCATION>McMurdo</LOCATION> Sound.
   ``This is the first time we've had a chance to use a spacecraft
designed to explore another planet to come back and look at our own
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and moon as if we were alien observers,'' <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   ``In the process, we're learning some new scientific things
about our own world and its companion, but perhaps more
importantly, it's providing us a different perspective on our own
home planet as a fragile world,'' he said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is the first craft equipped with modern instruments to
study the far side of the moon and photographed some regions for
the first time, said <PERSON>Clark Chapman</PERSON>, a researcher from the <ORGANIZATION>Planetary
Science Institute</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz</LOCATION>.
   ``We're going to learn a lot about the geology of the back side
of the moon,'' <PERSON>Chapman</PERSON> said. ``It's been a fantastic lunar mission
already.''
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> plans to release more pictures <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and hopes to
display a movie made of 1,400 still images showing clouds moving
above the spinning <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Some unreleased pictures were displayed <DATE>Thursday</DATE> during a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
closed-circuit television broadcast. They showed closeup views of
clouds drifting above <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and more distant peeks at <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Baja California</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Andes</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>Oct. 18,
1989</DATE>.
   It was to have been sent on a direct, two-year flight to
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. But after the <DATE>1986</DATE> explosion that destroyed the shuttle
Challenger, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> decided it was too risky to launch <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> from
the shuttle using a powerful liquid-fueled rocket. A weaker booster
was used, requiring <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> to use the gravity of Venus and Earth
to make a looping 2.4-billion-mile, six-year voyage.

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> has started testing sensors aboard
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>, five days after the spacecraft successfully fired its
thrusters for a second course correction on its journey to <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>
and <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We're testing all of the scientific instruments to ensure they
are ready to observe Venus'' when <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> whizzes past the
cloud-shrouded planet <DATE>Feb. 9</DATE>, said <PERSON>Jim Wilson</PERSON>, spokesman for the
<ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> fired its thrusters during a 2{-hour period
so that it will fly about 6,200 miles above the Venusian cloudtops,
<PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> said.
   ``The maneuver went off exactly as planned,'' <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> mission
director <PERSON>Neal Ausman</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> said another maneuver may be needed in late <DATE>January</DATE> to
fine-tune the spacecraft's trajectory. The first trajectory
maneuver was performed in <DATE>November</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was launched from the space shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>Oct. 18</DATE>.
It will swoop by <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> once and Earth twice so those planets can
act as ``gravity slingshots'' to propel <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> toward its <DATE>1995</DATE>
encounter with <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the solar system's largest planet.
   On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, the spacecraft was 12{ million miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,
but had traveled almost 105 million miles along its looping
185-million-mile path to <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> said.
   The spacecraft still has 2.3 billion miles left out of its
2.4-billion-mile trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   After flying past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in <DATE>December 1990</DATE> and <DATE>December 1992</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will separate into an orbiter and a probe in <DATE>July 1995</DATE>.
   The orbiter will circle the giant gas planet for 22 months
starting in <DATE>December 1995</DATE>, the same month the probe will parachute
into the Jovian atmosphere, collecting information for 75 minutes
until it is crushed by overwhelming atmospheric pressure.
   Scientific information that <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> collects during <DATE>February</DATE>'s
Venus flyby won't be transmitted back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> until late <DATE>October</DATE>,
after the spacecraft unfurls its umbrella-shaped, high-gain
antenna, <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> said.
   The antenna would be damaged by heat if it were as deployed near
<LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, the second planet from the sun, he added.

<HEAD>Huge Hurricane-Like Storm Found On Neptune; Like Jupiter's Great
Red Spot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A giant spot roughly 6,200 miles wide has
been discovered on the planet <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> by the Voyager 2 space probe,
and scientists said <DATE>Monday</DATE> it looks like a storm similar to the
Great Red Spot on <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``It's huge,'' said physicist <PERSON>Edward Stone</PERSON>, Voyager project
scientist for <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> and a vice president of the <ORGANIZATION>California Institute
of Technology</ORGANIZATION>. ``It would be reasonable to suspect this is a large,
hurricane-like storm system similar to the Great Red Spot.''
   However, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said Voyager 2 still is too far from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> to
determine if winds are swirling within the gargantuan spot, which
measures about 6,200 miles in diameter. <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot
contains 250 mph winds.
   Scientists haven't yet named <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s spot, but are calling it
``the dark spot'' because it appears darker than the surrounding
blue-greenish atmosphere, he added.
   The color of the spot isn't yet known because scientists haven't
processed a complete set of pictures through different color
filters, said <PERSON>Andrew Ingersoll</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Caltech</ORGANIZATION> planetary scientist.
   Voyager 2 is hurtling at more than 42,000 mph toward its <DATE>Aug. 24</DATE>
close encounter with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>. At that time, the hardy spacecraft
will zip within 3,000 miles of the gaseous planet's cloud tops _ by
far the closest of any of Voyager's planetary flybys. Five hours
later, it will fly within 25,000 miles of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
two known moons.
   By <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, Voyager 2 will be nearly 2.66 billion miles from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 58.98 million miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, traveling at a speed of
42,216 mph, said <PERSON>Mary Beth Murrill</PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION>National
Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   The <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> encounter will be Voyager 2's fourth and final
planetary flyby since the probe was launched from <LOCATION>Cape Canaveral</LOCATION> in
<DATE>1977</DATE>. It explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s dark spot is located at about 25 to 30 degrees latitude
in the planet's southern hemisphere, <ORGANIZATION>Ingersoll</ORGANIZATION> said, adding that
Voyager also discovered a much smaller, rapidly changing white spot
_ about half the size of the dark spot _ at about 70 degrees south
latitude.
   Stone said <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s dark spot first was clearly recognized in
still photographs taken by Voyager 2's television cameras in <DATE>April</DATE>,
and can be seen faintly in pictures taken as early as <DATE>January</DATE>.
   It isn't as large as <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot, which is 16,000
miles across at its widest point _ large enough to contain three
<LOCATION>Earths</LOCATION>. But the dark spot is just as large relative to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> _
about a fifth of the planet's diameter _ as the Great Red Spot is
relative to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot was discovered more than 350 years ago.
Ingersoll said it is believed to be red because of organic
chemicals, or possibly sulfur or phosphorus, trapped within it.
   Besides the Great Red Spot, <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> also contains dozens of
smaller storm systems, which appear as white spots, and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> also
has similar storms, although they are less visible, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The major mystery of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot is how the storm
has remained intact for centuries, while <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s hurricanes break up
after a week or two, <ORGANIZATION>Ingersoll</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The absence of continents on giant gas planets like <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> may explain the persistence of the spots, he said, adding
that continents may help dissipate hurricanes on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Computer simulations suggest smaller storms combine to form giant
storms such as the Red Spot and <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s dark spot, Stone and
<ORGANIZATION>Ingersoll</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Neptune is the solar system's fourth largest planet and usually
is the eighth planet from the sun. But because <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>'s elongated
elliptical orbit sometimes brings it closer to the sun, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
currently is the ninth and most distant planet from the sun.

   Voyager 2 found <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s moon <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> to
be a world in which volcanoes blast nitrogen ice 20 miles skyward
and where giant craters once overflowed with ocean-size floods of
frozen lava, scientists believe.
   If scientists are correct in their interpretation of Voyager's
photographs, <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> is only the third object in the universe where
active volcanoes have been identified.
   ``It's one of the most interesting and provocative worlds in the
solar system,'' says <PERSON>Charles Kohlhase</PERSON>, Voyager spacecraft mission
design manager at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   The latest data returned by Voyager's ultraviolet light sensor
revealed auroras _ somewhat like <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s northern and southern
lights _ in several places in <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s skies and over much of the
day side of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Roger Yelle</PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Arizona</ORGANIZATION>, said
<DATE>today</DATE>.
   The auroras are invisible to the human eye because they are
caused by electrically charged solar wind particles exciting
hydrogen gas to produce ultraviolet light, and they occur at odd
places because of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s tilted magnetic field, <PERSON>Yelle</PERSON> said. When
the particles are pulled toward <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s poles along magnetic field
lines, they excite nitrogen and oxygen gases to cause visisble
auroras.
   Voyager today snapped and sent back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> beautiful
photographs showing the sunlit, crescent edges of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>
as they were backlighted by the sun. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> expects to release prints
of the photo no earlier than <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> apparently has three types of volcanic activity.
   Scientists announced two of them <DATE>Friday</DATE>: huge inactive
crater-shaped volcanoes, called calderas, filled with lava made of
ice instead of molten rock; and long fault-line valleys filled with
oozing ice, a process likened to toothpaste coming out of a tube
slit with a razor blade.
   <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s biggest surprise came <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, when <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological
Survey</ORGANIZATION> geologist <PERSON>Laurence Soderblom</PERSON> announced that a third kind of
volcanic activity apparently had been identified. The latest
recorded photographs sent by Voyager reveal what look like active
ice volcanoes that erupt explosively, spewing nitrogen ice particles
and gas 12 to 20 miles high.
   ``The stuff comes shooting up like gas out of a gun barrel,''
said <ORGANIZATION>University of Arizona</ORGANIZATION> planetary scientist <PERSON>Bradford Smith</PERSON>,
leader of Voyager's photographic imaging team.
   Soderblom cautioned that the volcanic theory could turn out to be
a ``crazy idea,'' but other scientists expressed their support.
   ``It sounds like a very reasonable hypothesis,'' said Voyager
project scientist <ORGANIZATION>Edward Stone</ORGANIZATION>.
   Voyager has discovered six moons orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> in addition to
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Nereid</LOCATION>, which were discovered from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. It also has
found five rings of debris orbiting the planet, including two that
are broad bands of dust.
   By <TIME>9 p.m. PDT tonight</TIME>, Voyager will be 2.76 billion miles from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 3.65 million miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, speeding toward
interstellar space at 37,600 mph.
   As the craft sped toward the ill-defined boundary of the solar
system, about 1,500 mission scientists, engineers and their families
celebrated at a bash that featured rock 'n' roll legend <PERSON>Chuck Berry</PERSON>
singing ``Go, Voyager, go!'' a slightly modified version of his
classic ``<PERSON>Johnny B. Goode</PERSON>.''
   A recording of that song and other earth sounds was among the
cultural and historical items aboard aboard Voyager.
   The spacecraft made its closest approach to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>
<TIME>night</TIME> when it skimmed about 3,000 miles over the planet's north pole
cloudtops. Early <DATE>Friday</DATE>, it zoomed about 24,000 miles past <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>.
Since then, it has been sending back recorded photos that revealed
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s volcanic activity.
   Soderblom compared the new type of ice volcanoes to
sulfur-spewing volcanoes on <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s moon Io. But he said the
volcanoes on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> are produced when liquid nitrogen in underground
pools rises to the surface, where reduced pressure means ``it's got
to explode and will shower ice particles and gas.''
   ``I believe they are active,'' <PERSON>Soderblom</PERSON> said. ``There's 10 or 20
or 30 _ lots.''
   Based on dark-colored, plume-shaped deposits that stretch up to
50 miles downwind from the volcanoes, <PERSON>Soderblom</PERSON> estimated the
eruptions eject frosty debris at scores of mile per hour, perhaps
faster.
   <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said the deposits apparently contain radiation-darkened
ices that fell to the surface after being carried skyward by the
blast.
   Earth's volcanoes spew molten rock, and Io's erupts sulfur. Venus
also may have active volcanoes, but none has been spotted on the
cloud-shrouded planet.
   On <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> also revealed more surprises about <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s
apparently inactive caldera-like volcanoes, which measure up to
hundreds of miles wide and fill with what <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> described as flows
of viscous ice, possibly water ice, that gushes up from below.
   The new photos show <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s ice-lava lakes ``can come up and
overflow,'' <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said. ``You see that happen in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> all the
time'' when lava overflows calderas such as the one atop <LOCATION>Kilauea</LOCATION>
volcano.
   So eruptions from <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s calderas once produced a sea of
ice-like lava in repeated eruptions, resulting in massive,
oceanic-scale flooding, <PERSON>Soderblom</PERSON> said.
   A volcano is considered active if it has erupted within the 100
years. <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said he believes the newly discovered nitrogen ice
volcanoes erupted within the past century because they are located
on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s huge south polar ice cap.
   A year on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> lasts about 165 Earth years. So if
the ice cap had gone through a <DATE>summer</DATE>, evidence of volcanic deposits
would have been erased as the ice cap receded, he added.

<HEAD>Naval Observatory Astronomers Search for Theoretical 10th Planet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Astronomers at the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Naval Observatory</ORGANIZATION>
are narrowing their solar system search for a 10th planet, a
mysterious, phantom giant that has long captured the speculation
and interest of stargazers.
   Speculation about the existence of another planet evolved
because something, perhaps a massive object orbiting the sun on the
outer edge of the solar system, is giving a gravitational nudge
that disrupts the predicted orbits of Uranus and <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, said
astronomer <PERSON>R.S. Harrington</PERSON>.
   ``We are still incapable of predicting the location of Uranus,''
<PERSON>Harrington</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. ``It's clear something is wrong in the
outer solar system.''
   Astronomers have theorized since the beginning of the century
that some additional planets existed beyond the orbits of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
The theory sprang from observations that Uranus failed to orbit the
sun with the majestic and mathematical symmetry experts expected.
   That led to a search that resulted in the <DATE>1930</DATE> discovery of
<LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>, the ninth known planet in the solar system. Further
searching revealed in <DATE>1978</DATE> that a moon was orbiting <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>.
   But <PERSON>Harrington</PERSON> said calculations later showed the combined mass
of <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION> and its moon are about 1,000 times too small to account
for the detected, but unexplained irregularity of the <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and
Uranus orbits.
   ``Something is there and we've got to look,'' <PERSON>Harrington</PERSON> said.
   Some astronomers have attributed the abnormal orbit of Uranus
and <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> to errors in calculation.
   However, <PERSON>Harrington</PERSON> said a model of the solar system created by
the <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION>, which guided the Voyager spacecraft
near both Uranus and <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, still is not consistent with recent
observations on the position of Uranus. He said the <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> data seemed
to be in agreement for a time, but new observations show Uranus is
deviating from the expected path.
   ``Our current evidence is that the data is still off,'' he said.
``We still do not understand the outer solar system.''
   A search for Planet X is under way in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, the main
office of the <ORGANIZATION>Naval Observatory</ORGANIZATION>, and at the <ORGANIZATION>Black Birch Astrometric
Observatory</ORGANIZATION> near <ORGANIZATION>Blenheim</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Harrington</PERSON> said the search has been narrowed using a computer. A
number of theoretical 10-planet solar systems were simulated in a
<ORGANIZATION>Naval Observatory</ORGANIZATION> computer to determine where Planet X had to be to
produce the effects seen on the orbits of Uranus and <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   That relatively small area of the heavens will be searched in
<DATE>April</DATE> and <DATE>May</DATE> by an astrographic telescope at <ORGANIZATION>Black Birch</ORGANIZATION>. The
telescope will take pictures of the target area on successive
nights and the photos will be sent to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> for study.
   <PERSON>Harrington</PERSON> said he would use a machine called the blink
comparator to look for the phantom planet. A blink comparator
flashes back and forth between two photo plates, causing an
apparent motion to the observer if any point of light in the twin
photos has changed position from one night to the next.
   Planet X, <PERSON>Harrington</PERSON> said, is thought to be three to five times
larger than <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and moving in an orbit about three times farther
from the sun than <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>. That would make the phantom
planet about as visible as <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>, a planet seen only by
sophisticated telescopes.
   A planet in such a distant orbit would take about 1,000 years to
circle the sun.
   Even with the new techniques, <PERSON>Harrington</PERSON> said he was far from
certain that Planet X will be found.
   ``I have no better than a 50-50 confidence level that this thing
is there,'' he said.
   Harrington discussed the Planet X search on the opening day of
the 175th national meeting of the <ORGANIZATION>American Astronomical Society</ORGANIZATION>.
