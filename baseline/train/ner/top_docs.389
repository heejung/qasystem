   <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s Ariane 3 rocket lifted off
on schedule <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> for a mission to place French and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
communications satellites into orbit and reaffirm its role as the
<LOCATION>West</LOCATION>'s only active launcher.
   The rocket blasted off at <TIME>7:28 p.m.</TIME> from this jungle space
center on the northern coast of <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION> _ Ariane's 21st
launching and the first of eight planned for this year.
   <PERSON>Andre Payet</PERSON>, chief of mission, said no technical problems were
reported and weather conditions were good for the launch of the
rocket, owned by the <ORGANIZATION>European Space Agency</ORGANIZATION>.
   The launch was first scheduled for <DATE>December</DATE> but was delayed for
extra tests after anomalies were detected in the oxygen and liquid
hydrogen third-stage engine.
   ``We preferred to take the time to understand the problem,''
said <PERSON>Frederic d'Allest</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Arianespace</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>ESA</ORGANIZATION>'s commercial
arm.
   Third-stage engine failure was the cause of three of Ariane's
four failed launches _ in <DATE>September 1982</DATE>, <DATE>September 1985</DATE> and <DATE>May
1986</DATE>. The last failure, the 18th launch, left the rocket grounded
for more than a year.
   The other failed launch occurred in <DATE>May 1980</DATE> because of a
problem with the first-stage engine.
   Ariane produced a perfect 20th launch <DATE>Nov. 21, 1987</DATE>, but the
West German television satellite it placed into orbit developed
problems with its solar panels and is not fully operational.
   The 21st launch will thrust into orbit the American <ORGANIZATION>GTE Spacenet
Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s fifth satellite, Spacenet III R-Geostar R01. The satellite
is aimed at increasing the company's wide-ranging
telecommunications services in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and help set up a
system of satellite communication with mobile units such as trucks,
cars and trains.
   Two transponders on <ORGANIZATION>Spacenet III</ORGANIZATION> purchased by <ORGANIZATION>The Associated
Press</ORGANIZATION> are to provide the New York-based news cooperative with
domestic satellite delivery services over the next 10 years. A
satellite being used is nearing the end of its operational service.
   The French Telecom IC, the third in a series of satellites owned
by <ORGANIZATION>France Telecom</ORGANIZATION>, the state-owned telecommunications system, is
used for telephones, radio and television transmissions as well as
military communications.
   The new satellite is to replace <ORGANIZATION>Telecom</ORGANIZATION> 1-B, which broke down
<DATE>Jan. 15</DATE>.
   With the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> space shuttle grounded and Titan 4 and <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION>
rockets not yet competitive, Ariane remains the only active
launcher for commercial satellites in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>. However,
<ORGANIZATION>Arianespace</ORGANIZATION> is watching the return of the Americans to the
lucrative space market as well as competition from the <LOCATION>Soviet
Union</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
   Including <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s payload, <ORGANIZATION>Arianespace</ORGANIZATION> has 43 satellites on its
order books worth <MONEY>$2.36 billion</MONEY>, according to the company.
   To keep up with the orders, the <LOCATION>Kourou</LOCATION> space center has made two
launch pads available.
   Ariane's 21st launch is to be the first of eight this year, with
nine launches each planned for <DATE>1989</DATE> and <DATE>1990</DATE>, d'Allest said earlier
this week.

   Nearly half the 1,100
federal troops sent to maintain order on <ORGANIZATION>St. Croix</ORGANIZATION> after Hurricane
Hugo have returned home following a presidential order to withdraw.
   About 250 troops returned home aboard C-141 transport planes
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. On <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, the first 250 were flown back to the States,
said <ORGANIZATION>Joint Task Force</ORGANIZATION> spokesman Maj. <PERSON>Doug Foster</PERSON>.
   ``We should all be home for Thanksgiving,'' he said.
   The C-141 and C-130 transport planes were constantly flying in
and out of the island to evacuate heavy equipment and vehicles
brought by the soldiers when they arrived on <DATE>Sept. 21</DATE>, four days
after Hugo's ravaged the island.
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> ordered the withdrawal last week following a
request by Gov. <PERSON>Alexander Farrelly</PERSON>, who said the troops, most of
them from <LOCATION>Fort Hood</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Fort Bragg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>, were no longer
needed.
   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops were sent to curb looting and help local
authorities maintain order. Most stores had already been sacked of
food and other commodities by the time the soldiers arrived.
   ``It's important for the <ORGANIZATION>Virgin Islands National Guard</ORGANIZATION> and the
police to get back on their own feet now,'' Foster said.
   Farrelly's request for the pullout was criticized by three
business organizations, the <ORGANIZATION>St. Croix Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Board
of Realtors</ORGANIZATION> and a civic group called the <ORGANIZATION>United Concerned Citizens
of St. Croix</ORGANIZATION>.
   They charged the governor reneged on his promise to keep the
federal troops until all power and telephone services were restored.
   Hugo caused more than <MONEY>$500 million</MONEY> in damage to the <LOCATION>U.S. Virgin
Islands</LOCATION>, mostly on <LOCATION>St. Croix</LOCATION>, where most of the 52,000 residents
were left homeless.

<TEXT>
   Lebanon's political history has been
plauged by violence and turmoil.
   Since independence from <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in <DATE>1943</DATE>, <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>'s nine
presidents have grappled with sectarian fighting, coup attempts and
invasion by foreign forces.
   The latest victim was <PERSON>Rene Mouawad</PERSON>, who was elected president by
an emergency session of Parliament <DATE>Nov. 5</DATE> in <LOCATION>Syrian-controlled
north Lebanon</LOCATION> and served only 17 days before his assassination
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   The first president was <PERSON>Bishara Khoury</PERSON>, who was released from
his cell in a French prison when <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> elected him <DATE>Sept. 21,
1943</DATE>. The French-educated trial lawyer headed the <ORGANIZATION>Christian-Moslem
National Resistance</ORGANIZATION> against the French, who ruled <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION> under a
<ORGANIZATION>League of Nations</ORGANIZATION> mandate from <DATE>1920</DATE> to <DATE>1943</DATE>.
   In <DATE>1950</DATE>, forces loyal to <PERSON>Khoury</PERSON> and his Sunni Moslem prime
minister, <PERSON>Riyad Solh</PERSON>, suppressed a two-week revolt by the <ORGANIZATION>Syrian
Social Nationalist Party</ORGANIZATION> aimed at making <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION> part of a
``greater <LOCATION>Syria</LOCATION>.'' Syrian nationalist leader <PERSON>Antoine Saadeh</PERSON> was
executed.
   A year later, <PERSON>Solh</PERSON> was assassinated on a visit to <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON>.
   In <DATE>1952</DATE>, <PERSON>Khoury</PERSON> resigned after protest demonstrations broke out
when he sought to amend the constitution to extend his term.
   Parliament elected <PERSON>Camille Chamoun</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> ambassador and
a Maronite Catholic chieftain who survived four assassination
attempts to complete his six-year term.
   Chamoun asked for American help in <DATE>1958</DATE> when he faced a Moslem
revolt inspired by Egyptian leader <PERSON>Gamal Abdel Nasser</PERSON>'s radical
pan-Arabism. President <PERSON>Dwight D. Eisenhower</PERSON> sent 10,000 <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Marines</ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION> in <DATE>July 1958</DATE> and the rebellion fizzled.
   Chamoun's successor, army Gen. <PERSON>Fuad Chehab</PERSON>, crushed a coup
attempt on New Year's Eve by pro-Syrian army officers in <DATE>1959</DATE>.
   Lawyer <PERSON>Charles Helou</PERSON>, elected in <DATE>1964</DATE>, ruled as <PERSON>Yasser Arafat</PERSON>'s
Palestinian guerrillas built up their power base in <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>. In
<DATE>1969</DATE>, the Lebanese army clashed with Arafat's fighters in street
battles in south <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION>.
   Helou's successor, pro-Syrian <PERSON>Maronite Suleiman Franjieh</PERSON>,
oversaw the clashes between Christians and Palestinians that
triggered the civil war in <DATE>April 1975</DATE>. More than 150,000 people
have died since then.
   Parliament came under shellfire when <PERSON>Elias Sarkis</PERSON>, a former
<ORGANIZATION>Central Bank</ORGANIZATION> governor, was elected in <DATE>1976</DATE> with strong Syrian
backing. During his term the Israelis invaded in <DATE>1978</DATE> and <DATE>1982</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Bashir Gemayel</PERSON>, the Israeli-backed commander of the Christians'
main militia was elected to replace him. Gemayel, 34, was
assassinated in an east <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION> bombing <DATE>Sept. 14, 1982</DATE>, a week
before he was to be sworn in.
   Parliament unanimously elected his elder brother, Amin. His
reign saw the advent of Iranian-sponsored Shiite terrorism,
including the kidnapping of Westerners and the suicide bombings of
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and French military bases.
   Gemayel stepped down <DATE>Sept. 22, 1988</DATE>, with <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> unable to
elect a successor. He left <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION> in shambles and now lives in
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.

   A fugitive arrested in the <DATE>1976</DATE> car bombing
that killed the former Chilean ambassador was being held without
bond awaiting trial in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>
   <PERSON>Jose Dionisio Suarez y Esquivel</PERSON>, 51, arrested at his <LOCATION>St.
Petersburg</LOCATION> home early <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, waived his rights to a bond
hearing before a federal magistrate here on charges of conspiracy
to murder a foreign official.
   Suarez is accused of providing the explosives and detonating
devices in the explosion that killed former Chilean Ambassador
<PERSON>Orlando Letelier</PERSON> and business colleague <PERSON>Ronni Moffitt</PERSON> as they drove
to work in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sept. 21, 1976</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials said they expect the new Chilean government to
prosecute top intelligence officials of the former military
government of Gen. <PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON> on charges of planning
Letelier's assassination, The <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> reported today. The
killings long have been a sore point in relations between the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Sen. Edward M. Kennedy</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Mass.</LOCATION>, welcomed the
arrest and commended the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION>, but said, ``Unfortunately, the
masterminds of this atrocity remain at large in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>. I hope and
expect that the new democratic government in that nation will do
all in its power to bring them to justice.''
   A former Chilean diplomat, <PERSON>Jose Miguel Barros</PERSON>, testified in a
Chilean court last year that <ORGANIZATION>Letelier</ORGANIZATION>'s assassination was ordered
by Chilean army Gen. <PERSON>Juan Manuel Contreras Sepulveda</PERSON>, who headed
the <ORGANIZATION>Chilean National Intelligence Agency</ORGANIZATION>.
   Pinochet stepped down as president last month after the election
of a civilian, <PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON>.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> marhals said <PERSON>Suarez</PERSON> would be flown to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> as early
as <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. If convicted, he could face life in prison.
   <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agents said <PERSON>Suarez</PERSON> had been leading a secretive, cautious
life in <LOCATION>St. Petersburg</LOCATION>, rarely even leaving the house.
   ``To our knowledge, he hasn't been employed in the <DATE>last 12</DATE> to 14
years,'' said Assistant <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON>Terry Furr</PERSON>.
   But his 30-year-old wife <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON> said <PERSON>Suarez</PERSON> worked at home as
an artist and never realized his face had been plastered in post
offices and courthouses around the country for more than a decade.
   ``No one ever notified him he was a fugitive,'' said <PERSON>Mrs.
Suarez</PERSON>, a hospital administration employee and mother of a
15-month-old boy. She said they have lived either in <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>St.
Petersburg</LOCATION> throughout their nine-year marriage.
   Letelier served as Chilean ambassador to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in
<DATE>1971-1973</DATE>, during the presidency of <PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON>, who was
ousted by <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> in a coup. Letelier had begun to emerge as a
leading international critic of <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> when he and <PERSON>Moffitt</PERSON> were
assassinated.
   <PERSON>Michael V. Townley</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> citizen who also was an employee of
the Chilean intelligence agency, was arrested in <DATE>April 1978</DATE>.
Townley was extradited to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, confessed to planting
the bomb on the order of superiors and spent 40 months in prison.
   According to the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Townley</PERSON>, <PERSON>Suarez</PERSON> and fugitive <PERSON>Virgilio
Pablo Paz</PERSON> built the bomb used in the assassination. Suarez
allegedly provided the explosives and detonators and purchased the
bomb parts.
   A federal grand jury also indicted three Chilean army personnel
in connection with the case.
   Maj. <PERSON>Armando Fernandez Larios</PERSON> pleaded guilty to being an
accessory after the fact to <ORGANIZATION>Letelier</ORGANIZATION>'s death and was sentenced to
22 months in custody. The <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> has failed to obtain
the extradition of two others.

<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>Elias Hrawi</PERSON> declared the
Cabinet of the rebellious army chief, Gen. <PERSON>Michel Aoun</PERSON>, dissolved
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> and named a new government to end 14 years of civil war.
His predeccesor, slain after 17 days in office, was buried.
   In a rare display of national unity, businesses in both Moslem
and Christian areas closed for a nationwide day of mourning for
<PERSON>Rene Mouawad</PERSON>, killed by a bomb <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   Church bells rang and bands struck slow drum beats as his
flag-draped coffin inched through crowds in <LOCATION>Mouawad</LOCATION>'s hometown of
Zgorta. His widow, <LOCATION>Nayla</LOCATION>, and daughter Rima and son <PERSON>Michel</PERSON> walked
sobbing behind the cortege.
   Weeping women tossed roses and waved from balconies.
   Patriarch <PERSON>Nasrallah Sfeir</PERSON>, spiritual head of the Maronite
community, presided over the service, and <ORGANIZATION>Papal Nuncio Paolo Ponte</ORGANIZATION>
read a message from Pope <PERSON>John Paul II</PERSON>, saying the pontiff was
praying for <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>'s salvation.
   A 21-gun salute was fired as the coffin was put into a crypt at
<ORGANIZATION>St. Mary's Church</ORGANIZATION>, where it will remain until completion of a tomb
at the cemetery.
   <PERSON>Aoun</PERSON> said <PERSON>Hrawi</PERSON>'s election <DATE>Friday</DATE> was ``as unconstitutional as
that of Mouawad. Both have been elected under Syrian occupation.''
   ``They should have waited to find out who killed Mouawad before
appointing a new president,'' he said in a statement.
   No one has claimed responsibility for <ORGANIZATION>Mouawad</ORGANIZATION>'s assassination.
   Hrawi put himself on a collision course with <PERSON>Aoun</PERSON> by dismissing
the general's military Cabinet before dawn and forming a national
unity government with members from <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>'s seven major sects.
   The new government, under Sunni Moslem Prime Minister <PERSON>Salim
Hoss</PERSON>, is to oversee implementation of an Arab League-brokered plan
to introduce political reforms aimed at ending the civil war, which
has killed more than 150,000 people.
   Aoun rejects the accord, which was approved by parliamentarians
in <DATE>October</DATE> and which cleared the way for <ORGANIZATION>Mouawad</ORGANIZATION>'s election <DATE>Nov. 5</DATE>.
The military general said the plan is unacceptable because it does
not provide a timetable for the withdrawal of 40,000 Syrian troops
from <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>.
   Mouawad, 64, and 23 other people were killed <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> by a
remote-controlled bomb in Moslem west <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION>.
   It was not clear how <PERSON>Hrawi</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hoss</PERSON> would go about removing <PERSON>Aoun</PERSON>
to head off final partition of the country. Aoun commands the
loyalty of a cohesive army of about 20,000 that stands as the
nation's mightiest fighting machine.
   But his troops are outnumbered and outgunned by the Syrians,
whose soldiers control <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of Lebanese territory under a
<DATE>1976</DATE> Arab League mandate to quell civil war fighting.
   State-run television in <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION> said <PERSON>Hrawi</PERSON>, <PERSON>Hoss</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Defense</ORGANIZATION>
Minister <PERSON>Albert Mansour</PERSON> were meeting possibly to discuss dismissing
<PERSON>Aoun</PERSON> and appointing a new army commander.
   Aoun is holding out with his troops in the country's Christian
enclave, comprising east <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION> and land to the north. He said his
Cabinet is <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>'s only legitimate government.
   The 54-year-old soldier, a Maronite Christian like <PERSON>Hrawi</PERSON>, was
named to head an interim Cabinet by outgoing President <PERSON>Amin Gemayel</PERSON>
on <DATE>Sept. 22, 1988</DATE>, because Parliament was unable to agree on a new
president.
   Lebanon had been without a president since then until
parliamentarians approved the peace plan and then elected Mouawad.
   Hoss, whom Mouawad selected to be prime minister, also was named
prime minister by <PERSON>Hrawi</PERSON>, in addition to foreign minister.
   He retained Druse warlord <PERSON>Walid Jumblatt</PERSON> as public works
minister, and Shiite Moslem militia chieftain <PERSON>Nabih Berri</PERSON> as
minister of electrical and water resources. Berri also was given
the housing and cooperatives portfolio.
   Jumblatt and <PERSON>Berri</PERSON> are <LOCATION>Syria</LOCATION>'s main allies in <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>. They
fielded the largest Moslem militias in the war against the
Christians.
   <PERSON>Michel Sassine</PERSON>, a Greek Orthdox offered the position of deputy
premier and labor minister, turned down the post and flew to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>
without explaining why, state-run television in <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION> reported.
   Hoss introduced <PERSON>George Saadeh</PERSON>, leader of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION>Phalange
Party</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>'s largest Christian political force, into the new
government as minister of post and telecommunications.
   Saadeh, a Maronite based in the Christian enclave controlled by
<PERSON>Aoun</PERSON>'s army, said his participation must first be approved by his
party's Politburo.
   Also <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, Israeli jets blasted Palestinian targets in
eastern <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION> for the second time in three days, wounding two
guerrillas, in the 16th such air raid on the country this year.
   The target was a <LOCATION>Bekaa</LOCATION> base of Ahmed Jibril's Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine-General command.
   Police said at least two PFLP-GC fighters were wounded as two
fighter-bombers fired six rockets into the base in two runs at
<TIME>10:50 a.m.</TIME>

<FP=106> [By reporter <PERSON>Xu Yong</PERSON> (1776 0516)] </F>
  [Text] <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, 6 <DATE>May</DATE> (XINHUA) -- A six-member 
delegation headed by <PERSON>Zhang Dengyi</PERSON>, secretary general of the 
<ORGANIZATION>State Science and Technology Commission</ORGANIZATION>, yesterday held a report 
meeting at the <ORGANIZATION>Chinese Embassy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> to brief <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
Government officials and people from <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> enterprise and 
environmental protection circles on the contents of the "<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 
21st Century Agenda." 
  The agenda, which was recently approved by the <ORGANIZATION>State 
Council</ORGANIZATION>, 
is a detailed program of action prepared by the <ORGANIZATION>Chinese 
Government</ORGANIZATION> for implementing the strategy of sustained 
development decided on in <DATE>June 1992</DATE> by the <ORGANIZATION>UN Conference</ORGANIZATION> on the 
<ORGANIZATION>Environment and Development</ORGANIZATION>. It is the first document submitted 
in response to the "21st Century Agenda" adopted by the UN 
conference. 
  In his speech, <PERSON>Zhang Dengyi</PERSON> said: The central idea of the 
"<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 21st Century Agenda" is to carry through the strategy of 
sustained development, and, in light of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s reality, to 
establish unified policies on economic construction, social 
work, environmental protection, natural resources utilization, 
human resources development, and other important issues, in 
order to achieve comprehensive results in every aspect and to 
attain the most desirable objectives. 
  Zhang Dengyi added: <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has decided to inject the 
substance 
of the agenda, especially the important principles in it, into 
actual practices in all sectors. In particular, we will 
incorporate some key programs outlined in the agenda in the 
Ninth "Five-Year Plan for Economic Development" and in other 
plans whose duration is longer. 
  He stressed: <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has determined to take concrete measures 
in the hope that it will become the first country to fulfill the 
"21st Century Agenda." To fulfill this hope, we must cooperate 
with other countries. 
  He said that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> welcomes the more than 30 attendees of 
the 
report meeting to attend a high-level roundtable meeting on the 
"<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 21st Century Agenda" -- to be held in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> on <DATE>9 July</DATE> 
-- to discuss ways to carry out the strategy of sustained 
development and to study the possibility of international 
cooperation in this field with broad prospects. 
  The delegation arrived in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> on 4 <DATE>May</DATE> at the 
invitation of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Presidential Committee on Sustained 
Development</ORGANIZATION>. The delegation yesterday called on host officials 
and visited the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>World Resources Study Center</ORGANIZATION>. 
While in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, the delegation called on three UN deputy 
secretaries general and other UN officials, in winning some 
international organs' support for carrying out the "<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 21st 
Century Agenda." 
  After its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> visit, the delegation will fly to <LOCATION>Ottawa</LOCATION>, the 
capital of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, on 8 <DATE>May</DATE>.

<P>
Enthusiasm for space exploration is rising once again. The pictures and 
accounts of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and the ice volcanoes of its moon <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> inspired renewed 
support for space. And President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, on last month's anniversary of the 
Apollo moon landing, gave it focus by setting a long-term goal of a mission to 
Mars. 
</P>
<P>
The business of space is getting a boost also. On <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell Douglas</ORGANIZATION> 
picked up a <MONEY>$50-million</MONEY> fee for the launch aboard its <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION> rocket of a 
communications satellite for a commercial customer, <ORGANIZATION>British Satellite 
Broadcasting</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell Douglas</ORGANIZATION> has orders for eight more launches and is 
bidding for a ninth in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
It is not alone in the business. <ORGANIZATION>Martin Marietta</ORGANIZATION>, whose big Titan rocket will 
launch two satellites at once in <DATE>November</DATE>, has orders for three more such dual 
launches and is negotiating for a fourth. <ORGANIZATION>General Dynamics</ORGANIZATION> has 28 launches 
backlogged for its Atlas rocket, 10 of them for a <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> project with <ORGANIZATION>Hughes 
Aircraft</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
And small firms are very active, with sounding rockets that carry industrial 
experiments into the zero-gravity conditions of the suborbital atmosphere. 
<ORGANIZATION>American Rocket Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Camarillo</LOCATION>, will launch experiments for <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Strategic Defense Initiative</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Sept. 20</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>Space 
Services Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> -- former astronaut <PERSON>Deke Slayton</PERSON>'s firm -- 
successfully sent up a rocket in <DATE>March</DATE> carrying eight experiments for the 
<ORGANIZATION>University of Alabama</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Huntsville</LOCATION>.

<P>
</P>
<P>
Gearing Up for 21st Century 
</P>
<P>
So are all systems go for a boom in space? Not quite. What is happening today 
is an industrial revival from the shutdown that followed the Challenger space 
shuttle disaster in <DATE>1986</DATE>. <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> rocket makers now see "an attractive, albeit 
thin, market," says <PERSON>Alan Lovelace</PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION>General Dynamics</ORGANIZATION> space 
systems division. But they recognize that today's full order books are the 
result of the backlog that developed in the Challenger aftermath, when nothing 
was launched, and that when things settle down, the orders will be only a 
trickle. <ORGANIZATION>Hughes Aircraft</ORGANIZATION>, the leading satellite maker with more than half the 
40 commercial satellites now in space, estimates about five launches a year. 
</P>
<P>
Yet today's renewed enthusiasm is important, helping <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> industry to begin the 
real work of the <DATE>next decade</DATE>, which will be laying the groundwork of space 
platforms and communications systems for the wide-ranging exploration of space 
that is sure to come in the <ORGANIZATION>21st Century</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
And the revival is timely because competitors have been active. The European 
space consortium, <ORGANIZATION>Arianespace</ORGANIZATION> -- funded by 13 individual nations -- leads the 
world; it has put up 23 satellites in the <DATE>past four years</DATE> and has orders to 
launch almost four dozen more. <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> are offering launch 
services at cut-rate prices. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> has ambitious plans for space. In <DATE>1992</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi 
Heavy Industries</ORGANIZATION> will launch its H-2 rocket, and in the mid-1990s will put up 
the <LOCATION>Japan Environmental Module</LOCATION>, which is scheduled to accompany the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> space 
station. Beyond that, Japanese companies are being encouraged to think big by 
the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of International Trade and Industry</ORGANIZATION>, which is holding a 
competition for ideas on space exploration in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, despite today's enthusiasm, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> industry may not have smooth 
sailing when <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> gets the <MONEY>$30-billion</MONEY> bill for the space station, 
scheduled for launch in <DATE>1995</DATE> and envisioned as both a center for experiments 
and a platform for planetary exploration. There will be cries that it's a 
boondoggle and that space isn't a real profit-making business anyway. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not true. First, as the Europeans and Japanese understand, projects 
like the space station are needed to support the early stages of a new 
industry. And profit margins on space business are already good, says <PERSON>Donald 
Robinson</PERSON>, vice president of planning for <ORGANIZATION>American Rocket</ORGANIZATION>. American charges 
<MONEY>$800,000</MONEY> a launch on small rockets and earns <MONEY>$200,000</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, space is a business with a considerable record of success. Today's 
commercial rocket launches are not the dawn of the space business but the 
second stage of a developing industry, says <ORGANIZATION>General Dynamics</ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON>Lovelace</PERSON>, a 
one-time <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> official. Communications satellites -- the first stage -- have 
been a business for decades. 
</P>
<P>
Now we have launches, space-age trucking really. And the next stages, <PERSON>Lovelace</PERSON> 
says, will be in <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> remote sensing -- bringing to commercial business the 
work being done by spy satellites -- and weather control. 
</P>
<P>
Truth is, today's enthusiasm is not misplaced. Space exploration has already 
brought us wonders that we take for granted -- the techniques of image 
enhancement for pictures from space have brought our hospitals computerized and 
magnetic resonance brain and body scanning. And while <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> industry must now 
make up for some lost time, the advances of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> computer technology give 
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> an edge in space for the decade ahead. What will be needed most in the 
<DATE>1990s</DATE> is to keep up the enthusiasm and the vision -- and that is suddenly 
easier to do thanks to the triumphal pictures from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>.

   GORBACHEV PROPOSED major constitutional changes for the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>. 

   In a speech opening the first Communist Party conference in 47 years, the <ORGANIZATION>Kremlin</ORGANIZATION> leader offered changes that would strip the party of its administrative powers and transfer them to an elected presidential system of government that would replace the Supreme Soviet. 
<PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON>'s plan goes well beyond what he has said before by outlining for the first time how he intends to carry out his pledge to divide party and state. 
<PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> proposed that the party, which he would continue to head, would set the direction of policy. 

   Police in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> arrested groups of demonstrators demanding ethnic rights and calling for a multiparty political system in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.

The suit asked the court to remove from office any Teamsters official later found to have violated federal racketeering laws and appoint a trustee to ensure "free and fair" union elections. 
The suit is the first to apply the RICO statute's civil provision to an entire international union. 
A union official called the suit an "anti-labor tactic." 

   Teamsters President <PERSON>Presser</PERSON>, who has cancer, was hospitalized in <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> in serious condition.

<TEXT>
   The clout of this country's Maronite
Catholics, who have dominated its politics for a half century, is
rapidly crumbling amid blood feuds and a new Moslem ascendancy.
   The end of an era is looming for the only Christians in the
overwhelmingly <LOCATION>Moslem Middle East</LOCATION> to have controlled a state since
the Crusaders in the <LOCATION>Middle Ages</LOCATION>.
   The Gemayels, Chamouns and <PERSON>Franjiehs</PERSON> - the clans that have ruled
fractious <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION> since independence from <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in <DATE>1943</DATE> - are
entangled in a new round of vendettas that will probably seal their
fate.
   The <DATE>Oct. 21</DATE> slaying of Maronite political leader <PERSON>Dany Chamoun</PERSON>
and most of his family was the latest.
   ``No one listens to the voice of reason,'' <PERSON>Papal Nuncio Pablo
Puente</PERSON> lamented recently. ``Christians are destroying Christians in
senseless bloodbaths.''
   The nearly 1 million Maronites, the main Christian sect in
<LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>, have suffered more from their own feuds than from conflict
with Moslems in the nation's 15-year-old civil war.
   Under a proposed Arab League-brokered peace plan, the Maronites
would have to share power with Moslems, who now comprise a majority
of the 3.5 million people in a nation where Islamic fundamentalism
is on the rise.
   But many Maronites are reluctant to give up their privileges.
   ``I'm afraid we're going to go back to even worse times if the
Maronite establishment fails to respond to the winds of change,''
warned <PERSON>Elie Hobeika</PERSON>, a Syrian-backed leftist Maronite at odds with
the dominant right-wingers of his sect.
   Hobeika foresaw the need for the Maronites to give ground or
eventually perish and signed a Syrian-brokered peace treaty with
the main Moslem warlords in <DATE>1985</DATE>, when he headed the Christians'
main militia, the Lebanese Forces.
   But he was ousted by right-wing diehards the next year and fled
to territory controlled by the Syrians, who have about 40,000
troops in <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>.
   Hobeika returned to the Christian heartland northeast of <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION>
after Syrian and government troops crushed rebel Maronite Gen.
<PERSON>Michel Aoun</PERSON> on <DATE>Oct. 13</DATE>, removing the main obstacle to the new peace
plan.
   The return of <LOCATION>Hobeika</LOCATION>, 34, has raised fears of a showdown
between him and <PERSON>Samir Geagea</PERSON>, the right-wing Maronite who ousted
him in <DATE>1986</DATE> in a shootout that claimed the lives of 350 Christians.
   But even without the feuding, the power of the Maronite
political dynasties has ebbed.
   Christianity has been on the retreat in the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> for
years. Christian leaders noted at a recent conference in <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION>
that Christian emigration from the region, including <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>, is
growing amid rising Islamic fundamentalism.
   There are an estimated 12 million Christians in the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION>
compared with about 120 million Moslems.
   The Maronites - named for <ORGANIZATION>St. Maroun</ORGANIZATION>, a 5th century Syrian-born
monk who settled in the pine-covered Lebanese mountains - have seen
themselves as part a centuries-old fight for survival against
Islam.
   Yet their reluctance to share power with Moslems helped ignite
the civil war, which has left more than than 150,000 people dead.
   ``They're the only Christian community with a distinct political
history,'' said Prof. <PERSON>Kamal Salibi</PERSON>, who teaches history at the
<ORGANIZATION>American University of Beirut</ORGANIZATION>. ``They fear being overwhelmed. If
the system is democratized, they'll be outvoted and they can't
carry the day.''
   Of <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>'s three great Maronite patriarchs, only 79-year-old
<PERSON>Suleiman Franjieh</PERSON> is alive. His rivals, <PERSON>Pierre Gemayel</PERSON> and <PERSON>Camille
Chamoun</PERSON>, survived several assassination attempts and died of
natural causes.
   Now their heirs are at each others' throats.
   Patriarch <PERSON>Nasralla Sfeir</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Maronite</ORGANIZATION>'s spiritual head, has
proved helpless in efforts to try to reconcile them.
   His appeals for cease-fires and threats of excommunication have
gone unheeded, a far cry from the days when Maronite politicians
took their instructions from the patriarch.
   Two days after <PERSON>Aoun</PERSON> was crushed, gunmen killed <PERSON>Dany Chamoun</PERSON>, his

   The clout of this country's Maronite
Catholics, who have dominated its politics for a half century, is
rapidly crumbling amid blood feuds and a new Moslem ascendancy.
   The end of an era is looming for the only Christians in the
overwhelmingly <LOCATION>Moslem Middle East</LOCATION> to have controlled a state since
the Crusaders in the <LOCATION>Middle Ages</LOCATION>.
   The Gemayels, Chamouns and <PERSON>Franjiehs</PERSON> - the clans that have ruled
fractious <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION> since independence from <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in <DATE>1943</DATE> - are
entangled in a new round of vendettas that will probably seal their
fate.
   The <DATE>Oct. 21</DATE> slaying of Maronite political leader <PERSON>Dany Chamoun</PERSON>
and most of his family was the latest.
   ``No one listens to the voice of reason,'' <PERSON>Papal Nuncio Pablo
Puente</PERSON> lamented recently. ``Christians are destroying Christians in
senseless bloodbaths.''
   The nearly 1 million Maronites, the main Christian sect in
<LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>, have suffered more from their own feuds than from conflict
with Moslems in the nation's 15-year-old civil war.
   Under a proposed Arab League-brokered peace plan, the Maronites
would have to share power with Moslems, who now comprise a majority
of the 3.5 million people in a nation where Islamic fundamentalism
is on the rise.
   But many Maronites are reluctant to give up their privileges.
   ``I'm afraid we're going to go back to even worse times if the
Maronite establishment fails to respond to the winds of change,''
warned <PERSON>Elie Hobeika</PERSON>, a Syrian-backed leftist Maronite at odds with
the dominant right-wingers of his sect.
   Hobeika foresaw the need for the Maronites to give ground or
eventually perish and signed a Syrian-brokered peace treaty with
the main Moslem warlords in <DATE>1985</DATE>, when he headed the Christians'
main militia, the Lebanese Forces.
   But he was ousted by right-wing diehards the next year and fled
to territory controlled by the Syrians, who have about 40,000
troops in <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>.
   Hobeika returned to the Christian heartland northeast of <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION>
after Syrian and government troops crushed rebel Maronite Gen.
<PERSON>Michel Aoun</PERSON> on <DATE>Oct. 13</DATE>, removing the main obstacle to the new peace
plan.
   The return of <LOCATION>Hobeika</LOCATION>, 34, has raised fears of a showdown
between him and <PERSON>Samir Geagea</PERSON>, the right-wing Maronite who ousted
him in <DATE>1986</DATE> in a shootout that claimed the lives of 350 Christians.
   But even without the feuding, the power of the Maronite
political dynasties has ebbed.
   Christianity has been on the retreat in the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> for
years. Christian leaders noted at a recent conference in <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION>
that Christian emigration from the region, including <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>, is
growing amid rising Islamic fundamentalism.
   There are an estimated 12 million Christians in the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION>
compared with about 120 million Moslems.
   The Maronites - named for <ORGANIZATION>St. Maroun</ORGANIZATION>, a 5th century Syrian-born
monk who settled in the pine-covered Lebanese mountains - have seen
themselves as part a centuries-old fight for survival against
Islam.
   Yet their reluctance to share power with Moslems helped ignite
the civil war, which has left more than than 150,000 people dead.
   ``They're the only Christian community with a distinct political
history,'' said Prof. <PERSON>Kamal Salibi</PERSON>, who teaches history at the
<ORGANIZATION>American University of Beirut</ORGANIZATION>. ``They fear being overwhelmed. If
the system is democratized, they'll be outvoted and they can't
carry the day.''
   Of <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>'s three great Maronite patriarchs, only 79-year-old
<PERSON>Suleiman Franjieh</PERSON> is alive. His rivals, <PERSON>Pierre Gemayel</PERSON> and <PERSON>Camille
Chamoun</PERSON>, survived several assassination attempts and died of
natural causes.
   Now their heirs are at each others' throats.
   Patriarch <PERSON>Nasralla Sfeir</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Maronite</ORGANIZATION>'s spiritual head, has
proved helpless in efforts to try to reconcile them.
   His appeals for cease-fires and threats of excommunication have
gone unheeded, a far cry from the days when Maronite politicians
took their instructions from the patriarch.
   Two days after <PERSON>Aoun</PERSON> was crushed, gunmen killed <PERSON>Dany Chamoun</PERSON>, his
wife and two small sons at their home east of <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION>.
   Chamoun was a staunch supporter of <PERSON>Aoun</PERSON> and the slayings
appeared to be aimed at ending the political legacy founded by
<PERSON>Chamoun</PERSON>'s father, <LOCATION>Camille</LOCATION>.
   Other scores have also to be settled among the Maronite clans.
   Phalangist militiamen loyal to <PERSON>Pierre Gemayel</PERSON>'s youngest son,
<PERSON>Bashir</PERSON>, attacked <PERSON>Franjieh</PERSON>'s domain in <LOCATION>north Lebanon</LOCATION> on <DATE>June 13,
1978</DATE>, and slaughtered his son and political heir, <PERSON>Tony</PERSON>, along with
his wife and daughter and 21 bodyguards.

<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>Siad Barre</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Somalia</LOCATION> on
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> marked the 21st anniversary of the military coup that put
him in power by ordering the release of 1,278 prisoners, government
radio said.
   Radio Mogadishu gave no further details of the presidential
amnesty, saying only the prisoners had been ``jailed for various
crimes.'' The broadcast was monitored in <LOCATION>Nairobi</LOCATION>.
   Barre, a major general, seized power in a bloodless coup on <DATE>Oct.
21, 1968</DATE>, to prevent the election to the presidency of a civilian
opposed by the army.
   Since then, <PERSON>Barre</PERSON>'s socialist government has been plagued by
opposition groups. Western rights organizations and Somali refugees
say <PERSON>Barre</PERSON> has ruthlessly suppressed opposition in the east African
nation.
   In <DATE>1981</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Somalia National Movement</ORGANIZATION> was formed and has been
fighting the government to press for <ORGANIZATION>Barre</ORGANIZATION>'s ouster. Somalia also
is plagued by clan violence.
   Thousands of people have fled to neighboring countries.
   A report commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. State Department</ORGANIZATION> and released
in in <DATE>September</DATE> accused government troops of murdering an estimated
5,000 unarmed members of a northern clan in an 11-month period that
ended in <DATE>March</DATE>.
   Somalia became independent in <DATE>1960</DATE> after the unification of the
north and south, colonized by <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> respectively.

<FP=106> [Article by <PERSON>Shunji Taoka</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>AERA</ORGANIZATION> editorial staff member: "No </F>
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Military Presence Seen In the 21st Century As Tension 
Mitigates"] 
  [Text] National security policy planners are required to 
foresee what is ahead in the next l0 years or more -- if 
possible 30 years -- and at the same time, to review the past 
and present situation. 
  If the upcoming national defense buildup program is going to 
cover a five-year period as it has previously, it will cover the 
period from <DATE>fiscal year 1996</DATE> to <DATE>2000</DATE>. 
  Warships, aircraft, and the like requisitioned under the 
program are to be made ready, and the reorganization of units is 
to be completed sometime around <DATE>2005</DATE>. This equipment will be 
deployed and used at the first-line until <DATE>2025</DATE> or <DATE>2030</DATE>. 
  Planning a security program from the viewpoint of today's 
situation will render the future policy completely inadequate. 
  Although it is impossible to correctly predict the world and 
domestic situation or the development of scientific technology, 
a challenge must be made to guarantee security. 
  Today's utmost concern is the <ORGANIZATION>DPRK</ORGANIZATION>'s suspected nuclear arms 
development program and its stalled economy, but it is highly 
likely these issues will be settled by the early part of the 
next century. 
A Reduction of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Forces in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> Is Possible [subhead] 
  In <DATE>May</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>21st Century Committee</ORGANIZATION>, an advisory organ of <ORGANIZATION>ROK</ORGANIZATION> 
President <PERSON>Kim Yong-sam</PERSON>, submitted a report entitled: "The 
Republic of <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> in the 21st Century," predicting "the high 
possibility of the <ORGANIZATION>DPRK</ORGANIZATION>'s economic collapse within three to five 
years, and Korean unification by <DATE>2020</DATE>." 
  Last year, the <ORGANIZATION>DPRK</ORGANIZATION> was presumed to have produced 3,880,000 
tons of grain, comprising <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of the 6,500,000 tons it 
actually needed; the lack of foreign exchange reserves prevented 
it from importing foodstuffs. If this situation continues, the 
North Korean economy will not last long. 
  Meanwhile, if the <ORGANIZATION>DPRK</ORGANIZATION> adopts an open-door policy in order 
to 
attract foreign investment, the foundation of the Worker's 
Party-controlled <ORGANIZATION>DPRK</ORGANIZATION> regime -- which has shut off information 
from foreign countries and given its people falsified reports of 
the poverty-ridden <ORGANIZATION>ROK</ORGANIZATION> -- will be shaken. The report's contents 
are thus considered timely. 
  <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>'s armed forces have experienced considerable 
hollowing 
out in the <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION>, with less and less requisitioning of new 
arms and equipment. There are even insufficient personnel funds 
to pay wages -- because of the late payment and non-payments of 
officers' wages, their wives and children held a demonstration 
in <LOCATION>Sakhalin</LOCATION>. It will require decades for <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> to regain its 
status as a military power. 
  The modernization program of the Chinese armed forces is 
progressing at a far slower pace than those of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>ROK</ORGANIZATION>, 
and <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> (Republic of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>). The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, which 
informed the world of "<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> bending toward expanded armaments," 
has completely reversed its position from that of last year. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Defense</ORGANIZATION> approached <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> for a 
"U.S.-Chinese military exchange," to see if the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> 
can sell its weaponry to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. However, the <ORGANIZATION>Chinese Government</ORGANIZATION> 
seems to be in no position to allow rapid modernization of its 
armed forces, because of perennial huge budget deficits since 
<DATE>1986</DATE>. Nominal increases in the publicly announced defense 
budget are huge but are paralleled by the inflation rate. 
  When the Korean peninsula is united, a drastic reduction in 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Armed Forces in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> will be possible. This is especially 
true of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Third Marine Division</ORGANIZATION> which maintains a large 
complex of facilities on <LOCATION>Okinawa</LOCATION>. Originally, the division was 
intended for landing operations in the case of contingencies on 
the Korean peninsula, and was on the verge of dissolution last 
year in former <ORGANIZATION>Defense</ORGANIZATION> Secretary Les <PERSON>Aspin</PERSON>'s plan [sentence as 
published]. But it has survived temporarily because of tensions 
revolving around the <ORGANIZATION>DPRK</ORGANIZATION>'s suspected nuclear arms development 
program. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>12th Marine Air Group</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Iwakuni</LOCATION>, with about 60 aircraft 
comprised of FA-18 Hornet fighter bombers and AV-8 Harriers, 
will become defunct when the <ORGANIZATION>Third Marine Division</ORGANIZATION> is dissolved 
as it supports the <ORGANIZATION>Marines</ORGANIZATION>. 
<H5>  The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Is Going Allout To <ORGANIZATION>Stop Financial Deterioration </H5>
  The 18th Air Wing</ORGANIZATION> with 54 F-15 Eagle fighter-bombers at 
<LOCATION>Kadena Airbase</LOCATION> on <LOCATION>Okinawa</LOCATION> is ready to send reinforcement to the 
<ORGANIZATION>ROK</ORGANIZATION>. Even now several <ORGANIZATION>Eagles</ORGANIZATION> are being dispatched to <ORGANIZATION>Osan 
Airbase</ORGANIZATION>. This unit will become obsolete. 
  The landing crafts at <LOCATION>Sasebo</LOCATION> are for the transport of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Third Marine Division</ORGANIZATION> and they can be reduced. The old-type 
aircraft carrier Independence and its escort ships at <LOCATION>Yokosuka</LOCATION> 
need not remain in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. The carrier may be destined for 
retirement from service. The 432d <ORGANIZATION>Air Wing</ORGANIZATION> with 48 F-16 
Fighting Falcons at <ORGANIZATION>Misawa Airbase</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Aomori Prefecture</LOCATION>, will lose 
its reason for being there as the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> are 
now partners, and if the Korean peninsula is unified. 
  The colossal <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> financial deficit has no prospects of 
being 
reduced, and the danger of the dollar's collapse in value 
constitutes the biggest factor in world instability. 
  The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is compelled to make its prime objective 
preventing the financial deficit from deteriorating further, in 
order to protect its economic order and that of the world. 
  Even if the Japan-U.S. security system remains effective in 
the <DATE>21st century</DATE>, it will become something close to an "alliance 
without <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military presence." Historically speaking, that is 
an ordinary form of alliance.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>, <DATE>Feb. 4</DATE> (YONHAP) -- The <LOCATION>South Korea-U.S.</LOCATION> 
<ORGANIZATION>21st Century Council</ORGANIZATION> is due to be born on <DATE>Feb. 17</DATE> and

non-governmental dialogue channel that will exchange expertise 
on a wide range of issues. 
  With about 30 participants from each side, the council will 
meet in <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in turn every year behind 
closed doors. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu will make an opening speech at 
the inaugural meeting in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. He is among seven senior 
government officials invited along with ambassador to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> 
Han Sung-su and Assistant Foreign Minister Son Chun-yong. 
  The six politicians attending include Rep. <PERSON>Chong Che-mun</PERSON>,

Chairman Kim Sok-won and six other business leaders, 14 eminent 
professors and journalists, plus former <ORGANIZATION>Government 
Administration Minister Choe</ORGANIZATION> Chang-yun will also take part.

<TEXT>
   TV evangelists had a devil of a time. <PERSON>Jim Bakker</PERSON> had sex with
<PERSON>Jessica Hahn</PERSON>, lost his <ORGANIZATION>PTL</ORGANIZATION> ministry and went to jail for fleecing
his flock. <PERSON>Jimmy Swaggart</PERSON> confessed to moral failure with a <LOCATION>New
Orleans</LOCATION> prostitute.
   On the other hand, <ORGANIZATION>Playboy</ORGANIZATION> potentate <PERSON>Hugh Hefner</PERSON> made an honest
woman out of one of his Bunnies by wedding her, which some
sociologists said heralded the end to the one-night stand. Go
figure.
   The sheer terror of AIDS, which can be spread through sex, did
its part to modify behavior. Almost 70,000 Americans died of AIDS
during the decade, including Rock Hudson, <ORGANIZATION>Liberace</ORGANIZATION>, and artists,
athletes and journalists.
   Gambling turned <PERSON>Pete Rose</PERSON>'s field of dreams into a baseball
nightmare. The belly-flopping <PERSON>Charlie Hustle</PERSON> broke <PERSON>Ty Cobb</PERSON>'s
cherished record for all-time hits. But he was banned for life for
betting on games in the sport's worst scandal in seven decades.
   <PERSON>Michael Jackson</PERSON> moonwalked with a single, sequined glove, and
his ``Thriller'' album sold a record 40 million copies. Material
girl <ORGANIZATION>Madonna</ORGANIZATION> flashed <PERSON>Marilyn Monroe-style</PERSON> sex appeal.
   American life in the <DATE>'80s</DATE> had a deadly side, too.
   Drug wars sizzled as the Cold War thawed. Crack cocaine,
virtually unheard of in <DATE>1985</DATE>, riddled American cities with the
randomness of an assault gun by decade's end.
   Mass murderers stalked a <ORGANIZATION>McDonald's</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Ysidro</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, a
schoolyard in <LOCATION>Stockton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, and a printing plant in <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Ky</LOCATION>. Serial killer <LOCATION>Ted Bundy</LOCATION> was executed; <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Green River</LOCATION>
killer, blamed for over 40 deaths, remained at large.
   Around the world, war broke old yardsticks for barbarity with
modern weapons that killed and maimed with cold efficiency.
   <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> fought a <MONEY>$400 billion</MONEY>, eight-year conflict that
cost up to 1 million lives. The ayatollah's boy soldiers carried
their own coffins into battle; <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> countered human waves with
poison gas.
   Americans, too, killed and were killed in the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION>. An
Iraqi missile killed 37 sailors aboard the USS Stark, which was
mistaken for an Iranian warship. The USS <LOCATION>Vincennes</LOCATION> confused an <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>
Air A300 <ORGANIZATION>Airbus</ORGANIZATION> for a warplane, killing 290 civilians with a
missile, an eerie near-replay of another ``shootdown,'' when a
Soviet fighter blew <ORGANIZATION>Korean Air Lines</ORGANIZATION> Flight 007 out the sky,
killing 269 people, after the jetliner wandered into forbidden
airspace.
   <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION> got bloodier during a 14-year-old civil war between
age-old religious foes. Two Lebanese presidents were assassinated
seven years apart, the second only 17 days into his tenure.
   All told, <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>'s casualties mounted to 150,000, mostly
civilians. And again <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> paid a price. Sixty-three people were
killed in <DATE>1983</DATE> when a suicide truck bomber leveled the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Embassy</ORGANIZATION>, and 241 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> servicemen, serving as peacekeepers, died in
the terror bombing of their barracks.
   In <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>, a civil war between the Soviet-backed government
and U.S.-supported insurgents claimed 1.5 million lives. <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON>
called the conflict ``a bleeding wound,' and ended nine years of
intervention by Soviet military forces in <DATE>1989</DATE>. The Soviet toll:
13,310 dead.
   In <LOCATION>Ethiopia</LOCATION>, a non-stop civil war worsened the suffering of a
killer drought. Casualties from fighting and famine were estimated
at 1 million.
   Assassins felled <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Anwar Sadat</PERSON>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Indira Gandhi</PERSON> and
the Philippine opposition leader <PERSON>Benigno Aquino</PERSON>, whose widow,
<PERSON>Corazon</PERSON>, later was elected president and ousted <PERSON>Ferdinand Marcos</PERSON>
and his well-shod wife, <LOCATION>Imelda</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>John Lennon</PERSON> was silenced by a bullet. Pope <PERSON>John Paul II</PERSON>, like
<PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>, survived a gunman's attempt.
   Terrorism, some of it government-subsidized, spread insidiously.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> hostages were freed by <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> on <DATE>Jan. 20, 1981</DATE>, the day
<PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> was sworn in and <PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON> exited the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>.
   But more hostages were grabbed by Iran-backed extremists in
<LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION>. Eight Americans are still held, including journalist <PERSON>Terry
Anderson</PERSON>, now in his fifth year of captivity.
   Reagan retaliated for a terrorist bombing in <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> with
an air strike against <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>'s Col. <PERSON>Moammar Gadhafi</PERSON>, whom he called
``the mad dog of the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION>.''
   Terrorists hijacked airplanes and a cruise ship. A bomb downed
<ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 in <DATE>1988</DATE>, resulting in 270 deaths.
   Terror of a natural sort stalked the globe. Technology gave man
new weapons for tracking storms and predicting disasters. But
<PERSON>Gilbert</PERSON> and Hugo redefined the power and cost of hurricanes.
   An angry Earth blew its top in <DATE>1980</DATE> at <LOCATION>Mount St. Helens</LOCATION>, and a
Colombian volcano hatched a <DATE>1985</DATE> mudslide that killed 25,000. The
ground quaked in <LOCATION>Southern Italy</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Soviet Armenia</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION>.
   These were the <DATE>'80s</DATE>, when the Stars and Stripes were burnable,
and the Hammer and Sickle drooped listless in the ill winds, but
both were waved by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sailors at a seaborne summit.
   If the fast-forward blur of change seemed too much, solace could
be found in the durability of democracy's icons: The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
Constitution began its third century; the Statue of Liberty had a
makeover and celebrated its 100th birthday.
   And in the new revolutions, the words of an old revolution,
<PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON>'s revolution, rang out.
   ``We hold these truths to be self-evident,'' a brewery worker in
<LOCATION>Czechoslovakia</LOCATION> declaimed to fellow strikers as the decade closed,
``that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their
creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.''
   Past is prologue. Farewell, <DATE>1980s</DATE>. Hello, <DATE>1990s</DATE>.
   End Advance for <ORGANIZATION>Weekend Editions of Dec.</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>16-17</DATE>.

<HEAD>U.S. Military Prepared to Leave Philippines, But Hoping to Stay</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> negotiator said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>
Washington is prepared to give up its bases in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> but
wants a final decision delayed until the next century and voted on
by the Filipino people.
   Chief <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> negotiator <PERSON>Richard Armitage</PERSON> made the statement during
the opening session of talks here on the future of the U.S.-run
military facilities.
   ``It is clear to me ... that the days of a very large presence
of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sailors and airmen in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> are coming to an
end,'' <PERSON>Armitage</PERSON> said. ``What remains for us to determine is the
rate at which this presence will be reduced and the nature of the
relationship our two governments wish to pursue during and after
this transitional period.''
   ``Let the voters of the 21st century decide whether or not they
believe a continued <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> presence will be helpful,'' <PERSON>Armitage</PERSON> said.
   A spokesman for the Philippine negotiators, <PERSON>Rafael Alunan</PERSON>,
welcomed <PERSON>Armitage</PERSON>'s ``willingness ... to discuss the crafting of a
new relationship between our two countries'' but took exception to
<PERSON>Armitage</PERSON>'s call for Filipino voters in the next century to decide
on the American presence.
   ``This matter is not to be decided in the <DATE>21st century</DATE>,'' <PERSON>Alunan</PERSON>
said. ``The time for decision is now.''
   The lease on the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> bases expires in <DATE>September 1991</DATE>. Any
extension of the American presence after that must be approved by
the 23-member <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, where opposition to the bases is strong, and
also by a national referendum if ordered by the <ORGANIZATION>Philippines
Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
   Analysts say most Filipinos would vote for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> bases to
remain because of their economic benefits.
   The current talks are a continuation of negotiations that began
in <DATE>May</DATE> on the future of <ORGANIZATION>Clark Air Base</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Subic Bay Naval Base</ORGANIZATION> and
four smaller <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> facilities.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials previously stated <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops would remain in the
<LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> only as long as they are wanted. But on <DATE>Monday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>State
Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Richard Boucher</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> wants to keep
its bases in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>.
   Armitage's statement marked the first time a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> official had
publicly raised the possibility of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s readiness to give
up the bases. He did not propose a timetable for removing the
40,000 troops, <ORGANIZATION>Defense Department</ORGANIZATION> civilians and military
dependents. <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sources said <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> hopes for continued access
to the facilities, perhaps on a commercial basis, after
relinquishing formal control.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has strongly supported President <PERSON>Corazon
Aquino</PERSON>'s administration since <DATE>1986</DATE> when a civilian-military
uprising ended the 20-year rule of the late President <PERSON>Ferdinand
Marcos</PERSON>.
   In <DATE>December</DATE>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> jets flew air cover for government forces
during an unsuccessful bid by military rebels to oust <PERSON>Mrs. Aquino</PERSON>.
American troops from the bases also provided help for the
government during a <DATE>July</DATE> earthquake that killed nearly 1,700
people.
   But opponents believe the bases infringe on national sovereignty
and represent a vestige of American colonial rule, which ended with
independence in <DATE>1946</DATE>. <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> forces have been in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>
since the Americans captured the islands from <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> in <DATE>1898</DATE>, except
for a period of Japanese occupation during World War II.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Aquino</PERSON> said <DATE>Monday</DATE> her government wants to maintain close
ties with <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> but that the end of the Cold War and absence
of any external threat to the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> made the bases less
important.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Aquino</PERSON> said a government committee was drafting plans to
convert the bases into civilian use, including a commercial airport
at <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> and a ship repair facility at <LOCATION>Subic</LOCATION>.
   Meanwhile, Communist rebels claimed responsibility for a bombing
late <DATE>Monday</DATE> at a <ORGANIZATION>Voice of America</ORGANIZATION> station 60 miles north of <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>.
The insurgents said the bombing was to protest continued <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
``domination'' of this former colony. There were no injuries, and
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials said damage was slight.
   Last <DATE>May</DATE>, Communist rebels killed two American airmen near <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>
on the eve of talks on the bases. American troops and their
families have been restricted to base to prevent possible attacks
during the current negotiations.

   Every Lebanese president has been able to
count on one thing _ trouble, and plenty of it.
   Each of the eight presidents since independence from <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in
<DATE>1943</DATE> has been plagued by violence.
   Now, after 13 months without a president, <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> is trying
to approve a peace agreement aimed at ending the 14-year-old
sectarian civil war and elect a new head of state under its terms.
   Under an unwritten covenant accepted in <DATE>1943</DATE>, when <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>
gained independence from <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, presidents have been Christians,
prime ministers Sunni Moslems and <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> speakers Shiite Moslem.
   The first president was <PERSON>Bishara Khoury</PERSON>, a French-educated lawyer
and leader of the Christian-Moslem national resistance against the
French, who had governed under a <ORGANIZATION>League of Nations</ORGANIZATION> mandate since
<DATE>1920</DATE>.
   He was in a French prison in <LOCATION>southeast Lebanon</LOCATION> _ <ORGANIZATION>Rachaya Castle</ORGANIZATION>,
built by Crusaders _ when <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> elected him on <DATE>Sept. 21, 1943</DATE>,
and was driven from his cell to the presidential palace in <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION>.
   Five years later, <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> approved a new constitution under
which he was elected for a second term, of six years.
   In <DATE>1950</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Syrian Social Nationalist Party</ORGANIZATION> staged an armed
revolt aimed at making <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION> part of a ``greater <LOCATION>Syria</LOCATION>.'' The
leftist party advocates union of <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Syria</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON>, pre-1948
Palestine, <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION>.
   Khoury and his Sunni prime minister, <PERSON>Riyad Solh</PERSON>, suppressed the
revolt in two weeks and party leader <PERSON>Antoine Saadeh</PERSON> was executed. A
year later, three members of the party assassinated Solh while he
was visiting <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON>.
   In <DATE>1952</DATE>, <PERSON>Khoury</PERSON> sought to amend the constitution so he could
serve another term, but was unsuccessful and relinquished power to
a transitional military government under Gen. <PERSON>Fuad Chehab</PERSON>, the army
commander.
   Parliament elected <PERSON>Camille Chamoun</PERSON>, a former ambassador to the
<ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION>, as president <DATE>Sept. 22, 1952</DATE>.
   Chamoun faced a Moslem revolt in <DATE>1958</DATE> inspired by the radical
teachings of <PERSON>Gamal Abdul Nasser</PERSON>, then <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s leader. He asked for
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> help and President <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> sent 10,000 Marines.
   During a long political career, <PERSON>Chamoun</PERSON> survived at least four
attempted assassinations. He died of natural causes in <DATE>1988</DATE>, as had
Khoury in <DATE>1962</DATE>.
   Chehab, still army commander, was elected by <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>
unanimously to succeed <PERSON>Chamoun</PERSON>. In <DATE>1959</DATE>, his powerful military
intelligence branch ruthlessly crushed a New Year's Eve coup
attempt by army officers who belonged to the <ORGANIZATION>Syrian Social
Nationalist Party</ORGANIZATION>.
   He was followed in <DATE>1964</DATE> by his protege <PERSON>Charles Helou</PERSON>, a lawyer,
during whose term <PERSON>Yasser Arafat</PERSON>'s Palestinian guerrillas built
their power base in <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>.
   That led to the first major Israeli attack on <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION>.
Helicopter-borne paratroopers landed at the airport and blew up 10
jetliners of <ORGANIZATION>Middle East Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>'s national carrier, in
<DATE>1968</DATE>.
   In <DATE>1969</DATE>, the Lebanese army fought Arafat's guerrillas in south
<LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION>. Nasser of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> intervened on behalf of Arafat and the
guerrilla presence in <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION> was secured.
   <PERSON>Suleiman Franjieh</PERSON>, a Maronite Catholic warlord and close friend
of Syrian President <PERSON>Hafez Assad</PERSON>, succeeded <PERSON>Helou</PERSON> in <DATE>1972</DATE>. His term
was marked by clashes between Christians and Palestinians that
started the civil war in <DATE>April 1975</DATE>.
   Franjieh asked for Syrian military intervention in <DATE>1976</DATE> to keep
the Palestinians and their leftist and Moslem allies from
overwhelming the Christians.
   <LOCATION>Syria</LOCATION> now has 40,000 soldiers in <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION> and their presence has
frustrated many efforts to end a civil war that has cost more than
150,000 lives.
   Artillery shells were falling around <LOCATION>Parliament</LOCATION> when it chose
Syrian-backed <PERSON>Elias Sarkis</PERSON>, director of the central bank, was
elected with Syrian backing to succeed Franjien. During his term,
the Israelis invaded in <DATE>1978</DATE> and <DATE>1982</DATE>.
   His successor was <PERSON>Bashir Gemayel</PERSON>, 34, who had Israeli support
and commanded the main Christian militia. He was assassinated <DATE>Sept.
14, 1982</DATE>, a week before the inauguration.
   Parliament unanimously elected his elder brother, <PERSON>Amin</PERSON>, who
signed a coexistence treaty with <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> in <DATE>April 1983</DATE> but tore it
up a year later under Syrian pressure.
   Gemayel's term saw the beginning of terrorism by pro-Iranian
Shiite Moslems. Suicide truck bombers killed 241 American
servicemen and 58 French paratroopers, part of a multnational
peacekeeping force, on <DATE>Oct. 23, 1983</DATE>.
   On <DATE>Sept. 22, 1988</DATE>, Gemayel stepped down after naming Gen. <PERSON>Michel
Aoun</PERSON> as head of a caretaker Christian administration when
<ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> could not agree on a successor.
   Moslems formed a rival government led by <PERSON>Salim Hoss</PERSON>, the prime
minister under <ORGANIZATION>Gemayel</ORGANIZATION>.

   Pipe bombs exploded <DATE>Monday</DATE> at a <ORGANIZATION>Bank
of Boston</ORGANIZATION> branch and a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION> recruiting office prior to a <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>
hearing on the island's future political relationship with the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   Police said no one was injured and damage was slight in the
pre-dawn blasts in <LOCATION>Bayamon</LOCATION>, about 15 miles southwest of <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>.
   Similar explosions, with no injuries and minor damage, occurred
<DATE>Friday</DATE> at a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Customs office in the southern city of <PERSON>Ponce</PERSON> and
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> at a Chase <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> bank branch in the north-central city of
<LOCATION>Caguas</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Los Macheteros</LOCATION>, a militant pro-independence group that has been
relatively inactive in recent years, claimed responsibility for
<DATE>Monday</DATE>'s bombings.
   In a letter delivered to <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>, the
group said it was protesting the ``farcical hearings'' being held by
a <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> committee here on a plebiscite planned for <DATE>1991</DATE> that will
allow Puerto Ricans to vote on their future relationship with the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   The group also cited the jailing of Macheteros members in
connection with the <MONEY>$7 million</MONEY> robbery of a <ORGANIZATION>Wells Fargo</ORGANIZATION> depot in
<LOCATION>Hartford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1983</DATE>.
   On <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, a federal court in <LOCATION>Hartford</LOCATION> sentenced a Macheteros
member, <PERSON>Juan Segarra Palmer</PERSON>, to 65 years in prison and fined him
<MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> for his part in the robbery. He and three other people were
convicted in <DATE>April</DATE>.
   Nine others accused of the robbery, including alleged Macheteros
leader <PERSON>Filiberto Ojeda Rios</PERSON>, are awaiting trial.
   The letter said the violence would continue until the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> ended its military, political and economic presence in <LOCATION>Puerto
Rico</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> said it was investigating the letter, which bore the
star-and-machete logo of the <ORGANIZATION>Macheteros</ORGANIZATION>' ``Ejercito Popular
Boricua,'' or People's <ORGANIZATION>Army of Borinquen</ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION>Los Macheteros</LOCATION> is Spanish
for The Machete Wielders, and <ORGANIZATION>Borinquen</ORGANIZATION> is the Indian name for
<LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>.
   The explosions <DATE>Monday</DATE> occurred within an hour of each other, said
police spokeswoman <ORGANIZATION>Maria del Pilar Bon</ORGANIZATION>. She said one bomb slightly
damaged the bank building's facade and shattered windows of a nearby
bus terminal. The other blast shattered windows of the recruiting
office.
   The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee</ORGANIZATION> held
hearings in <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <DATE>Saturday</DATE> and <DATE>Monday</DATE> on the proposed
plebiscite on whether <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> should remain a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> commonwealth,
become the 51st <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> state or seek independence.
   The <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> island of 3.2 million mostly Spanish-speaking
people has been a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> commonwealth since <DATE>1952</DATE>.
   It will be the first vote on <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>'s political status since
<DATE>1967</DATE>, when <PERCENT>67 percent</PERCENT> voted to remain a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> commonwealth, <PERCENT>32
percent</PERCENT> for statehood and less than <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> for independence.
Puerto Rico's statehood and independence parties did not actively
participate in that vote.
   <PERSON>Sen. J. Bennett Johnston</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-La.</LOCATION>, who presided at the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>
hearings, said at the close of <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s session that the plebiscite
would be ``fundamentally different'' because the three status
options would be precisely defined and the vote would be binding on
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
   Under commonwealth, <LOCATION>Puerto Ricans</LOCATION> are <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> citizens and eligible
for federal benefits, but they cannot vote for president. The island
received <MONEY>$6.5 billion</MONEY> in federal money in <DATE>1988</DATE>.
   The committee's next round of hearings is scheduled for <DATE>July
12-14</DATE> to hear the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration's views on the plebiscite.
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has said he favors statehood.

<TEXT>
   More than a year after <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION> Flight 103
blew up over <LOCATION>Lockerbie</LOCATION>, police officials from that Scottish town
came to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to brief relatives of the bombing's
victims on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   About 130 people showed up at the <ORGANIZATION>St. Charles Hotel</ORGANIZATION> in this town
about 30 miles south of <LOCATION>Albany</LOCATION> to hear Chief Constable <PERSON>George Esson</PERSON>
of <LOCATION>Lockerbie</LOCATION> give details of his department's investigation.
   ``Better late than never,'' said <PERSON>Bert Ammerman</PERSON>, president of
<ORGANIZATION>Victims of Pan Am</ORGANIZATION> Flight 103.
   The group <PERSON>Ammerman</PERSON> heads is made up of relatives of the 259
people killed when a bomb smuggled aboard Flight 103 exploded over
<LOCATION>Lockerbie</LOCATION> on <DATE>Dec. 21, 1988</DATE>. Eleven more people were killed on the
ground as debris from the exploded jet rained down on the Scottish
village.
   <PERSON>Esson</PERSON> said he and two other investigators traveled to the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> because <PERSON>Ammerman</PERSON>, a resident of <LOCATION>River Vale</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, requested
that they inform families individually in a way the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government
had seemed unwilling to do.
   Victims of <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 came together after the crash in
part because the families were frustrated by the lack of
information coming from their own government.
   ``We've not only lost loved ones, but the love of our country
and the feeling that our country would be there for us,'' said <PERSON>Bill
Monetti</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Chatham</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, whose nephew, <PERSON>Rick Monetti</PERSON>, was killed in
the crash.
   ``We have a government that would like this to be an invisible
episode,'' said <PERSON>Georgia Nucci</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Hudson</LOCATION>, who lost her son <PERSON>Chris
Jones</PERSON>.
   However, many family members who showed up said they were
encouraged that agents from the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> and a member of the
<ORGANIZATION>Presidential Commission on Security</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Aviation</ORGANIZATION> and Terrorism showed
up at the briefing.
   Ammerman, whose brother <PERSON>Tom</PERSON> was killed in the bombing, said he
would like to see <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> law enforcement agencies act more like their
counterparts in <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>.
   ``Today's meeting was a major step forward in having appropriate
agencies extending themselves to the families,'' he said.
   Informational packets were handed out to the families at a
closed-door briefing <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>. The contents of the packets
were not revealed, but <PERSON>Esson</PERSON> said that catalogues were included
listing items recovered at the crash site that are still unclaimed.
   About <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> of the personal effects of the victims is still
in storage in <LOCATION>Lockerbie</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Esson</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Nucci</PERSON> said the closed-door meeting also featured videos showing
a reconstruction of the bombed out portion of the plane and the
memorial service held last <DATE>Dec. 21</DATE> in <LOCATION>Lockerbie</LOCATION> to mark the
one-year anniversary of the crash.
   A presidential commission has been investigating the disaster
since <DATE>last August</DATE>. Their report is tentatively due on <DATE>May 1</DATE>.

   A boiler pipe ruptured <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> on the USS
Iwo Jima, spewing out super-heated steam that killed 10 sailors.
   The accident aboard the amphibious assault ship and the death of
a Marine when his jeep overturned in <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION> boosted the
number of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military deaths to 43 during the nearly 3-month-old
Operation Desert Shield.
   ``Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who
have departed us,'' said the Iwo Jima's commander, Capt. <PERSON>Michael
O'Hearn</PERSON>.
   The accident was the worst for the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> in the U.S.-led air,
land and sea mobilization that followed <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>'s <DATE>Aug. 2</DATE> invasion of
<LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>. In the only other <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> fatality during Operation Desert
Shield, a sailor was electrocuted in <DATE>August</DATE> aboard the USS
Antietam.
   The <PERSON>Iwo Jima</PERSON>, part of the amphibious task force and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> naval
armada supporting Operation Desert Shield, left <LOCATION>Bahrain</LOCATION> an hour
before the <TIME>8:15 a.m.</TIME> accident.
   ``It was only a couple of miles from the pier when the accident
occurred,'' said Lt. <PERSON>Kevin Wensing</PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Command Naval
Forces</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Central Command</ORGANIZATION>.
   Wensing, who visited the ship after it returned to port, spoke
of the ``heroism'' of a well-trained crew who quickly ``secured the
(ship's) two boilers, anchored the ship, evacuated the injured
after their condition was stabilized, and collected the remains of
the dead.''
   He said because the boilers were shut off, and although the
vessel had emergency diesel generators for backup, it was towed
back to port with the help of Bahraini tugs.
   He described the mood of the rest of the 685-man crew and 1,100
Marines aboard as ``somber but very determined.''
   Six sailors died immediately after the accident. The Iwo Jima,
which played a major role in evacuating the 241 Marines killed by a
suicide bomber in <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION> in <DATE>1983</DATE>, used its own helicopters to
transport four injured sailors to the hospital ship USS Comfort.
   Two of the injured died aboard the hospital ship, the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> said.
The last two survivors were reported in very serious condition, and
late <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> confirmed they
also had died.
   Identities of eight of the killed were released by the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Atlantic Fleet</ORGANIZATION>. Two names were withheld pending notification of
next of kin. The <LOCATION>Iwo Jima</LOCATION> is based in <LOCATION>Norfolk</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va</LOCATION>.
   -<PERSON>David A. Gilliland</PERSON>, 21, <LOCATION>Warrensburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mo</LOCATION>.
   -<PERSON>Mark E. Hutchison</PERSON>, 27, <ORGANIZATION>Elkins</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>W. Va</LOCATION>.

   The Marine who died, identified as 1st Lt. <PERSON>Michael N. Monroe</PERSON>,
27, of <LOCATION>Auburn</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>, was with three others from the <ORGANIZATION>1st Battalion</ORGANIZATION>,
3rd Marines when their jeep overturned and went down a 20-foot
embankment, a military statement said. His companions were in
stable condition.
   In a related development, officials said three American sailors
were injured when their pickup truck was hit <DATE>Monday</DATE> by two
.50-caliber machine-gun rounds fired accidentally by a Marine
sentry.
   The accidental gunfire occurred as the sailors approached the
entrance to a <ORGANIZATION>Marine Corps</ORGANIZATION> facility. One sailor was hit by a bullet
in the shoulder and chest, the second was injured by glass shards
and the third suffered a concussion, a military statement said.

<TEXT>
   Lebanon's political mob war has spared no
one.
   Leaders from all major Moslem and Chrisiian groups in the bloody
15-year power struggle have been assassinated by bullets or bombs.
   The latest victim, Christian leader <PERSON>Dany Chamoun</PERSON>, was killed
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> when five gunmen burst into his <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION> apartment. The five
uniformed gunmen, who used silencer-equipped pistols, also murdered
his wife and two small sons.
   The slayings were branded by Christian and Moslem leaders alike
as an attempt to block a plan to end the civil war, which has
primarily pitted Moslems against Christians.
   Chamoun, a <ORGANIZATION>Maronite Catholic</ORGANIZATION> and the son of late President
<PERSON>Camille Chamoun</PERSON>, was one of the most outspoken critics of President
<PERSON>Elias Hrawi</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Syria</LOCATION>'s military presence in <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>.
   He also was at odds with Christian warlord <PERSON>Samir Geagea</PERSON>, whose
Lebanese Forces militia fought a four-month war with Gen. <PERSON>Michel
Aoun</PERSON>'s troops early this year for mastery of the Christian
hinterland.
   Chamoun was a top supporter of <PERSON>Aoun</PERSON>, who took refuge in the
<ORGANIZATION>French Embassy</ORGANIZATION> a week ago after being routed by government and
Syrian troups. <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> has granted him asylum, but the government
insists he stay and stand trial for alleged crimes.
   Chamoun's father, <LOCATION>Camille</LOCATION>, died a natural death in <DATE>August 1987</DATE>.
But in <DATE>1980</DATE> and <DATE>1987</DATE>, he narrowly escaped assassination when
remote-controlled bombs exploded near his car, wounding him both
times.
   On <DATE>June 13, 1978</DATE>, Christian militiamen loyal to <PERSON>Bashir Gemayel</PERSON>
murdered <PERSON>Tony Franjieh</PERSON>, son and political heir of <PERSON>Suleiman
Franjieh</PERSON>, president of <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION> <DATE>from 1970</DATE> to <DATE>1976</DATE>.
   Franjieh's wife and three-year-old daughter were also killed.
   Gemayel later admitted that his men were involved - but said
they had no authorization to kill <PERSON>Franjieh</PERSON>, who led a rival
militia.
   Four years later, <PERSON>Gemayel</PERSON> was slain at age 34. Three weeks after
being elected president on <DATE>Aug. 23, 1982</DATE>, he was killed in an
explosion at the headquarters of his <ORGANIZATION>Phalange Party</ORGANIZATION>, the leading
Maronite Christian political grouping.
   <PERSON>Rene Mouawad</PERSON>, head of an important Christian clan in <LOCATION>northeast
Lebanon</LOCATION>, did not even last as long as Gemayel as president.
   On <DATE>Nov. 22, 1989</DATE>, just 17 days after his election, a
remote-control bomb killed Mouawad. He was succeeded by <PERSON>Hrawi</PERSON>, who
is seeking to implement an Arab League-brokered peace plan.
   The most important surviving Christian militia leader, <PERSON>Geagea</PERSON>,
has survived several assassination attempts.
   Moslem factions have also seen their top chiefs murdered.
   Prime Minister <PERSON>Rashid Karami</PERSON>, the most prominent Sunni Moslem
leader in <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>, was killed <DATE>June 1, 1987</DATE>, when a bomb exploded
aboard an army helicopter in which he was a passenger.
   The current prime minister, <PERSON>Salim Hoss</PERSON>, has tasted the threat of
assassination.
   Hoss, a prominent Sunni Moslem leader, was education minister in
<DATE>1984</DATE> when a bomb exploded as he drove to a mosque, wounding him
with glass and shrapnel.
   Lebanon's largest religious group, the Shiite Moslems, lost
their leader <PERSON>Musa Sadr</PERSON>. He disappeared in <DATE>1978</DATE> while on a trip to
<LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>, whose leader <PERSON>Moammar Gadhafi</PERSON> has backed the Sunnis. Sadr is
presumed to have been murdered.
   <PERSON>Kamal Jumblatt</PERSON>, a prominent left-wing political leader and chief
of <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>'s Druse sect, which fields one of the toughest militias,
was machine-gunned to death at a road ambush in <DATE>March 1977</DATE>.
   His son and successor, <PERSON>Walid Jumblatt</PERSON>, survives uneasily. In
<DATE>June 1987</DATE>, he asked an aide to open a gift that appeared to be a
case containing a pen. It exploded, blowing the aide's hands off.
   Prominent foreigners have also fallen in the spate of
assassinations.
   In <DATE>June 1976</DATE>, kidnappers took <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Ambassador <PERSON>Francis E. Meloy</PERSON>
and his economic counselor, <PERSON>Robert O. Waring</PERSON>, from their limousine.
Their bullet-riddled bodies were recovered later at a beach in
Moslem west <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION>.
   Four <ORGANIZATION>French Embassy</ORGANIZATION> staffers have been killed since <DATE>1981</DATE>,
including Ambassador <PERSON>Louis Delamar</PERSON> when three gunmen fired on him
on <DATE>Sept. 4, 1981</DATE>, just outside his home.
   <PERSON>Malcolm Kerr</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>American University of Beirut</ORGANIZATION>, was
shot to death in a hallway outside his office in <DATE>January 1984</DATE>.
   On <DATE>Oct. 23, 1983</DATE>, a suicide truck-bomber blew up the
headquarters of the French contingent of the multinational
peacekeeping force in <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION>, killing 58 French soldiers.
   A similar bombing was carried out at the same time against the
force's <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Marine contingent, killing 241 Americans. The bombings
were claimed by the pro-Iranian Shiite extremist group called
Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War.
   An estimated 150,000 people have died in <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>'s civil war.

<TEXT>
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> acknowledged today
that the days of a large <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military presence in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>
are numbered, and asked for time to phase out its oldest and
largest bases abroad.
   ``It is clear to me ... that the days of a very large presence
of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sailors and airmen in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> are coming to an
end,'' chief American negotiator <PERSON>Richard Armitage</PERSON> told the opening
session of talks on the bases' future.
   ``What remains for us to determine is the rate at which this
presence will be reduced and the nature of the relationship our two
governments wish to pursue during and after this transitional
period.''
   It was the first time a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> official had publicly raised the
possibility that <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> is prepared to give up the six bases.
   The talks continue negotiations begun in <DATE>May</DATE> on the future of
<ORGANIZATION>Clark Air Base</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Subic Bay</LOCATION> naval base and four smaller
installations. Their lease expires in <DATE>September 1991</DATE>, and
<LOCATION>Philippine</LOCATION> opposition to the installations is growing.
   On <DATE>Monday</DATE>, a bomb exploded at a <ORGANIZATION>Voice of America</ORGANIZATION> relay station
60 miles north of <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>, and Communist rebels claimed
responsibility in a statement, saying they were protesting <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
``domination'' of the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>.
   There were no injuries, and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials said damage was
slight.
   The talks are being held in the <ORGANIZATION>Central Bank</ORGANIZATION> building, guarded
by more than 1,500 police and soldiers. About 1,000 leftist workers
and students rallied near the bank today to protest the bases but
dispersed peacefully after police refused to allow them to march to
the site.
   At least 17 people were arrested and 14 injured during
anti-bases protets in <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> diplomats have said in the past that <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops will
remain in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> only as long as they are wanted.
   On <DATE>Monday</DATE>, however, <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Richard Boucher</PERSON>
said <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> wants to keep its bases in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>.
   In his comments today, <PERSON>Armitage</PERSON> did not propose a timetable for
removing the 40,000 troops, <ORGANIZATION>Defense Department</ORGANIZATION> civilians and
military dependents. But he hinted that the process could extend
until the end of the century.
   He said the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Philippine military, Filipino base workers
and other nations in the region need time to adjust to the possible
closing of the bases.
   ``Let the voters of the 21st Century decide whether or not they
believe a continued <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> presence will be helpful,'' <PERSON>Armitage</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Rafael Alunan</PERSON>, spokesman for the Philippine negotiators, said
<LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> welcomed <PERSON>Armitage</PERSON>'s ``willingness ... to discuss the
crafting of a new relationship between our two countries.''
   But he took exception to <PERSON>Armitage</PERSON>'s call for voters of the next
century to decide on the American presence. ``This matter is not to
be decided in the <DATE>21st century</DATE>,'' <PERSON>Alunan</PERSON> said. ``The time for
decision is now.''
   Rep. <PERSON>Stephen Solarz</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. House Foreign Affairs</ORGANIZATION>
subcommittee on Asian and <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> affairs, said <DATE>Friday</DATE> that <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
officials were considering a 10-year phaseout.
   Last month, <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> newspapers quoted unidentified sources as
saying the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> was considering allowing the Americans to
remain in <LOCATION>Subic</LOCATION> for up to 10 years if they returned <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> and the
other installations in <DATE>1991</DATE>.
   Opponents believe the bases infringe on national sovereignty and
represent a vestige of American colonial rule, which ended with
independence in <DATE>1946</DATE>. <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> forces have been in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>
since the Americans captured the islands from <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> in <DATE>1898</DATE>.
   During a nationally televised speech <DATE>Monday</DATE>, President <PERSON>Corazon
Aquino</PERSON> said her government wants to maintain close ties with
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. But she said the end of the Cold War and absence of any
external threat to the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> made the bases less important.
   ``It is now necessary for our government to work with the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> for arrangements regarding the orderly withdrawal of their
forces from our country,'' <PERSON>Mrs. Aquino</PERSON> said.
   She noted that a government committee is drafting plans to
convert the bases into civilian use, including a commercial airport
at <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> and a ship repair facility at <LOCATION>Subic</LOCATION>.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has strongly supported the Aquino
administration since a <DATE>1986</DATE> revolution ended the 20-year rule of
the late President <PERSON>Ferdinand Marcos</PERSON>, a longtime <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ally.
   In <DATE>December</DATE>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> jets from <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> flew air cover for government
forces during an unsuccessful bid by military rebels to oust <PERSON>Mrs.
Aquino</PERSON>.
   American troops from the bases also provided help for the
government during a <DATE>July</DATE> earthquake that killed nearly 1,700
people.

'20TH CENTURY' BUSINESSES FACE DILEMMA AS 21ST CENTURY NEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN CHRISTIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Would you entrust your health to a store named <ORGANIZATION>19th Century Medical Supplies</ORGANIZATION>? 
Would you seek advice about your newfangled, revolutionary product from a firm 
entitled <ORGANIZATION>19th Century Advertising Consultants</ORGANIZATION>? Would you computer-shop at <ORGANIZATION>19th 
Century Electronics</ORGANIZATION>? 
</P>
<P>
Of course, none of these establishments exist. But in one measly decade, a few 
Orange County businesses could sound equally anachronistic. As <DATE>1990</DATE> heralds the 
final lap of the <ORGANIZATION>20th Century</ORGANIZATION>, an epithet that once conveyed up-to-the-minute 
modernism will become a relic from another era. 
</P>
<P>
So, what's a business like <ORGANIZATION>20th Century Marketing</ORGANIZATION> to do? "Maybe we'll rename 
the company '20th Century Plus,' " laughed its owner and president, <PERSON>Roger 
Christopherson</PERSON>. Oh, well, the problem will be someone else's, he shrugged: "I'm 
56; I'll be retired by then." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Christopherson</PERSON> founded his La Habra consulting firm in <DATE>1977</DATE>, when the 21st 
Century seemed as distant as compact disc players, glasnost and the return of 
the miniskirt. "We chose our title because it implied that you could count on 
us to be in the know," he said. "I suppose we'll have to change it, which is a 
shame since <DATE>'20th Century</DATE>' has a nice ring to it. I don't think '21st Century' 
is an easy-sounding name." 
</P>
<P>
Then again, he could leave well enough alone and hope that prospective clients 
have a sense of humor. "Perhaps we'll make a joke out of it -- <DATE>'20th</DATE> Century 
Marketing: We'll Catch Up Sooner or Later,' " <PERSON>Christopherson</PERSON> proposed. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park-based <ORGANIZATION>20th Century Pools</ORGANIZATION> could dive into the next century with an 
updated nomenclature -- but for now, powers-that-be are only testing the water. 
"We may go to 'Century Pools' or 'Century 21 Pools,' " said the 13-year-old 
company's general manager, <PERSON>Leo Newport</PERSON>. "There's already a '21st Century 
Pools,' so we can't use that. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever change we make will be minor. Our name has come to represent 
reliability and trust, so I don't believe it would turn people away if we 
decided to stick with '20th Century.' " 
</P>
<P>
But might not the almost-passe designation conjure up images of kidney-shaped 
pools, circa <DATE>1961</DATE>? 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, this is a question that we will need to address more carefully in 
the coming years. However, 10 years is a long time to change direction. Exxon 
made a radical name change, but within a few years, most people couldn't tell 
you <ORGANIZATION>Exxon</ORGANIZATION>'s old name. (For the record, it was <ORGANIZATION>Standard Oil Co.</ORGANIZATION>, changed in 
<DATE>1972</DATE>.) 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Linda Manikas</PERSON>, founder of <ORGANIZATION>20th Century Beauty Pageant</ORGANIZATION>, planned ahead for the 
shifting sands of time. "Originally, when we registered our name with the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. 
Patent Office</ORGANIZATION>, we also registered '21st Century Beauty Pageant,' " the contest 
producer said. 
</P>
<P>
Based in <LOCATION>Brea</LOCATION>, the 15-year-old organization puts on nationwide competitions for 
children and teen-agers. Since her current clients will live the bulk of their 
lives on the other side, <PERSON>Manikas</PERSON> reasoned, she won't wait until the next 
century to employ its birth name. "We'll probably start using '21st Century' 
this coming year," she said. "We basically deal with children, and the <ORGANIZATION>21st 
Century</ORGANIZATION> will be their century." 
</P>
<P>
20th <ORGANIZATION>Century Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which focuses on <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> clientele, 
likewise has taken steps toward the new millennium. Its parent company, <ORGANIZATION>20th 
Century Industries</ORGANIZATION>, last year added a sister insurance company -- <ORGANIZATION>21st Century 
Casualty</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"We realized that the <DATE>20th Century</DATE> was quickly turning into the 21st Century," 
said company spokesman <PERSON>Daryn Teague</PERSON>. "I don't know whether or not we eventually 
will rename <ORGANIZATION>20th Century Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>, but we're certainly in a preferable 
position, having a (21st-Century) title off the ground and running." 
</P>
<P>
Many new players were farsighted enough to enter the game already wearing the 
more fashionable jersey number. 
</P>
<P>
"The 20th Century is a dinosaur," proclaimed <PERSON>Vernon VanWinkle</PERSON>, who opened <ORGANIZATION>21st 
Century Video Productions</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>Orange two years ago</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure that '21st Century' improves our sales, but '20th Century' 
definitely would have hurt sales in another 10 years," said <PERSON>Stephen Graves</PERSON>, 
owner of <ORGANIZATION>21st Century Innovations Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a software developing company in <LOCATION>El 
Toro</LOCATION>. "I wouldn't buy software from a place named '20th Century.' I'd think: 
'These guys aren't up to date here.' 
</P>
<P>
"In the past six months, I've seen a lot of ads in computer magazines for new 
companies named 21st Century," Graves noted. "It seems that all of a sudden 
everyone is jumping on the 21st-Century bandwagon." 
</P>
<P>
Marketing experts concurred. 
</P>
<P>
"Especially if you were selling high technology, you'd be killing yourself with 
'20th Century' in your title," said <PERSON>Dan Krongaard</PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Galusha 
&amp; Associates</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Newport Beach</LOCATION> advertising and public relations firm. 
</P>
<P>
"The 20th Century once stood for forward-thinking, but it suddenly has a patina 
about it," said <PERSON>Dan Pittman</PERSON>, vice president of <PERSON>Salvati Montgomery Sakoda</PERSON>, an 
advertising firm in <LOCATION>Costa Mesa</LOCATION>. "However, some companies are so identified with 
the '20th-Century' title that they wouldn't benefit from changing it. I doubt, 
for example, that <ORGANIZATION>20th Century Fox</ORGANIZATION> will change its name." 
</P>
<P>
He was right there; the most famous of 20th Century-denominated companies sees 
no need to mess with antiquity. 
</P>
<P>
"The official word from this corner is that the company does not plan to drop 
'20th Century' from its title," said <PERSON>Dennis Petroskey</PERSON>, director of corporate 
communications. "The name is what it is. 20th <ORGANIZATION>Century Fox</ORGANIZATION> is no more identified 
with the <ORGANIZATION>21st Century</ORGANIZATION> than it is with the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries; (the 
film-making corporation) came to be in the <DATE>20th Century</DATE>." 
</P>
<P>
Also for historical purposes, <ORGANIZATION>20th Century Limited Restaurant</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Costa Mesa</LOCATION> 
will stay on the same track. "It's named after a train that ran between <LOCATION>New 
York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> from <DATE>1902</DATE> until the late '50s," explained Manager <PERSON>Mitch 
Mortesen</PERSON>. "The restaurant is set up in the style of Grand Central Station. So 
its name won't ever change." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Tom Nguyen</PERSON>, on the other hand, harbors no sentimental attachment to his store's 
masthead, <ORGANIZATION>20th Century Video</ORGANIZATION>. Still, revising it hardly seems worth the effort 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
"When is the 21st Century? In 10 years? That's a long way off," the <PERSON>Stanton</PERSON> 
proprietor commented indifferently. "Why should I change the name? If I changed 
the name, I'd have to change everything -- the receipts, the membership cards. 
The patent office would charge me more money. It costs a lot to change a name." 
</P>
<P>
These are the good old days, said <ORGANIZATION>El Toro</ORGANIZATION> genealogist <PERSON>Steve Frogue</PERSON>. So his 
service, 20th Century Biography and Genealogy, will remain firmly rooted in the 
present -- even after the present becomes the past. 
</P>
<P>
"I tape people's life stories for their children and grandchildren," said 
<PERSON>Frogue</PERSON>, who teaches history at <ORGANIZATION>Saddleback College</ORGANIZATION>. "Their lives have been 
marked by 20th-Century events -- World War II, the <LOCATION>Kennedy</LOCATION> assassination. 
</P>
<P>
"The people I interview reminisce about the time they ran down the road to see 
a car drive by, or an airplane fly overhead. I'm struck by the feeling that no 
generation after this one will experience such a fascinating century. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember a quote by <PERSON>Mark Twain</PERSON>, who lived from <DATE>1835</DATE> to <DATE>1910</DATE>. He said that 
his life and heart were with his own century, but he wished the 20th Century 
well. That's probably how I'll feel about the 21st Century."

   Soldiers held their children tight, military wives shopped with
tears in their eyes and at least one bride was left at the altar as
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops were mobilized to help <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION> defend a possible
attack by <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION>.
   Pfc. <PERSON>Mark Ohmer</PERSON>, a member of <LOCATION>Fort Bragg</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>82nd Airborne
Division</ORGANIZATION>'s chemical unit, was to marry <PERSON>Angela Nelson</PERSON>, 19, on
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> in suburban <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>. The <MONEY>$6,000</MONEY> wedding was postponed when
he was called back to the <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> base to prepare to leave
for <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>.
   ``It's scary _ not just for my wedding, but for the country and
for all the soldiers who might have to go over there and fight,''
<PERSON>Nelson</PERSON> said. ``It happened so fast. I'm so upset.''
   In <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, convenience store clerks said brisk sales of
chewing tobacco, batteries and insect repellent to somber soldiers
and their wives were sure signs <LOCATION>Fort Bragg</LOCATION> soldiers were ready to
go.
   ``A lot of fathers are coming in with their kids, holding them
real tight'' and many wives are in tears as they make their
purchases, said <PERSON>Effie Parsons</PERSON>, a clerk at the Short Stop
convenience store near the base.
   ``They are definitely going. There is no doubt in my mind that
this is another war,'' said <PERSON>Ms. Parsons</PERSON>, 23.
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> ordered <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> forces to <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION> to repel a
potential Iraqi attack. Iraq invaded neighboring <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> last week.
   ``At my direction, elements of the <ORGANIZATION>82nd Airborne Division</ORGANIZATION>, as
well as key units of the <ORGANIZATION>United States Air Force</ORGANIZATION>, are arriving
today to take up defensive positions in <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said
<DATE>today</DATE>. ``I took this action to assist the Saudi Arabian government
in the defense of its homeland.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
besides that division from <LOCATION>Fort Bragg</LOCATION>, they expected deployment of
the <ORGANIZATION>24th Division</ORGANIZATION> (Mechanized) from <LOCATION>Fort Stewart</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>101st
Airborne Division</ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION>Fort Campbell</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky</LOCATION>. Elements of those three
units would be deployed with the <ORGANIZATION>18th Airborne Corps</ORGANIZATION>, a control
unit at <LOCATION>Fort Bragg</LOCATION> that directs the combat divisions, the sources
said.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> provided no estimate of the number of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops involved
in the deployment. But government sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity said at least 5,000 ground troops were involved, along
with 140 sophisticated fighters and bombers.
   About 2,000 troops temporarily stationed at <LOCATION>Fort Chaffee</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ark.</LOCATION>,
for training were headed back to their home base at <LOCATION>Fort Bragg</LOCATION>
``because of the activities in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>,'' said base spokesman <PERSON>Cecil
Green</PERSON>.
   A task force of the <ORGANIZATION>82nd Airborne Division</ORGANIZATION> had been
participating in a mock war scheduled to end <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, but the
exercise was cut short, he said.
   At <LOCATION>Fort Campbell</LOCATION>, a base spokesman said <DATE>today</DATE> that the 101st
Airborne had not been deployed to <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>, but soldiers were
tensely awaiting word.
   ``I'm sure everybody that had access to a TV was watching
closely, or if they did not, listening to the radio,'' said public
affairs officer <PERSON>Bill Harralson</PERSON>.
   Soldiers on leave from the <ORGANIZATION>24th Infantry Division</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Fort
Stewart</LOCATION> were summoned back <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, but base officials refused to
say whether they were being sent to the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION>.
   Spec. 4 <PERSON>Norman Aimes</PERSON>, 24, part of the infantry division, said he
was called back from leave in <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>.
   ``They called and said there is a <PERCENT>99 percent</PERCENT> chance that we are
going,'' <ORGANIZATION>Aimes</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> sources said <DATE>today</DATE> that a second <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> cruiser was added
to the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION>, bringing to nine the number of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ships in
the strategic water way.
   The sources said the battleship <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>, carrying cruise
missiles, was deployed <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> and that President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>
planned to send F-15 and F-16 fighter aircraft. Already deployed
were five AWACs reconnaisance planes, government officials said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> and government officials downplayed the possibility of a
blockade or military involvement for sailors aboard the USS
Saratoga, which set out <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> from the <LOCATION>Mayport Naval Station</LOCATION> near
<LOCATION>Jacksonville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>.
   But the possibility of action was on the minds of many family
members as the huge aircraft carrier set out.
   ``I hope we get involved. I hope so. Maybe we can straighten out
the situation out there. Maybe they need us to go in and kick
butt,'' said <PERSON>Wendy Hunter</PERSON>, holding her 8-month-old son, <PERSON>Jonathan</PERSON>.
   Her husband, <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>, is aboard the <LOCATION>Saratoga</LOCATION>, which was joined by a
small support flotilla that included the guided missile cruiser
Philippine Sea, the destroyers Spruance and <PERSON>Sampson</PERSON>, and the
frigate <PERSON>Elmer Montgomery</PERSON>.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> state, four <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> squadrons with more than 950 men
from <LOCATION>Whidbey Island Naval Air Station</LOCATION> were aboard the three
aircraft carriers in or heading for the gulf, said base spokesman
<PERSON>Howard Thomas</PERSON>.

President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, marking the 20th anniversary of man's first lunar landing, 
proposed today that the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> establish a base on the moon in the 21st 
Century to be followed by a manned mission to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> offered no price tag for the costly program he promised would lead "back 
to the moon, back to the future, and this time back to stay." 
</P>
<P>
"Then a journey into tomorrow," he said. "A journey to another planet, a manned 
mission to Mars." The distance between Mars and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> varies from 48.7 million 
miles and 248 million miles. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> offered few details beyond his broad goals, and said he was leaving it to 
Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Space Council</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> to come up with 
"realistic timetables." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Deadline for <ORGANIZATION>Mars Trip 
</P>
<P>
Adm. Richard Truly</ORGANIZATION>, administrator of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>, said the President has asked that 
the lunar station be established in the <DATE>first decade of the next century</DATE>. He 
said no deadline has been set for the Mars mission. 
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony from the steps of the <ORGANIZATION>National Air and Space Museum</ORGANIZATION>, the 
President reasserted the goal of establishing Space Station Freedom in the 
<DATE>1990s</DATE>, the necessary first step for the moon and Mars projects. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was flanked on the outdoor museum stage by <PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON> and <PERSON>Buzz Aldrin</PERSON>, 
the two men who planted their footsteps on the moon on <DATE>July 20, 1969</DATE>, and 
<PERSON>Michael Collins</PERSON>, the third member of the Apollo 11 crew.

"<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> should never stop seeking distant frontiers," <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said. "We dream of 
distant shores we've not yet seen. . . . A dream to be realized by future 
generations must begin with this generation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have rested on our Apollo laurels long enough. It's time to get moving 
again," <PERSON>Collins</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> drew Democratic support for his vision, but the decision to provide no 
budget or deadline prompted criticism.

<P>
'One Small Step' 
</P>
<P>
Rep. <PERSON>Dennis E. Eckart</PERSON> (D-Ohio) said <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was "calling for one great leap for 
mankind" but not even providing the money for "one small step," using a 
take-off of <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION>'s first words from the lunar surface. 
</P>
<P>
"The party of <PERSON>John Kennedy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lyndon Johnson</PERSON> applauds the decision of 
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to recommit <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> to space exploration," said Rep. <PERSON>Richard A. 
Gephardt</PERSON> (D-Mo.), the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> majority leader. 
</P>
<P>
"But the real test of presidential leadership is not whether he can marshal the 
words but the resources to restore <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s preeminence in space," <PERSON>Gephardt</PERSON> 
said. "In sum, <PERSON>Mr. President</PERSON>, there's no such thing as a free launch." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Gephardt</PERSON> said that under Democratic presidents of the '60s, the <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> budget 
approached <PERCENT>4%</PERCENT> of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> budget. Republican Presidents of the '80s have 
proposed less than <PERCENT>1%</PERCENT>, he said.

<P>
<MONEY>$30-Billion</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Start-Up Cost 
</P>
<P>
Truly</ORGANIZATION>, in a press briefing at the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>, noted that <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> is already 
balking at the start-up costs for the <MONEY>$30-billion</MONEY> space station. The station is 
the essential for the moon project and the trip to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an irony that at the time we find this sort of leadership and vision for 
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s future, that at the same time, this very day up on the Hill, we are 
in fact fighting very hard for the very life of Space Station Freedom and other 
things in the civil space program," he said.

<HEAD>St. Croix Residents Protest Troop Withdrawal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business owners and
residents of <ORGANIZATION>St. Croix</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> protested President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s plan
to withdraw 1,100 federal troops that were sent to the island to
quell looting after Hurricane Hugo hit.
   The <ORGANIZATION>United Concerned Citizens of St. Croix</ORGANIZATION>, formed last week to
protest the plan, said it joined the <ORGANIZATION>St. Croix Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION>
and the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Realtors</ORGANIZATION> to lobby the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION>
urging <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to rescind the order.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Defense Department</ORGANIZATION> announced <DATE>Thursday</DATE> troops would all be
withdrawn within 20 days. The soldiers, mostly military police,
arrived <DATE>Sept. 21</DATE> to restore order, four days after Hugo had passed
and most stores were looted.
   In a full-page ad in the daily <ORGANIZATION>St. Croix Avis</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, the
group urged residents to phone the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> to tell
authorities ``that we Crucians appreciate and want continued
military presence.''
   ``We have no electricity and telephones and we want to be safe
on the island,'' the ad said.
   The group, which represents shop owners and residents, said that
by <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> more than 300 calls had been made to the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION>
and the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> pleading for the troops to stay.
   Chamber of <ORGANIZATION>Commerce President Jan Hanley</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> accused Gov.
<PERSON>Alexander Farrelly</PERSON> of reneging on his promise to not request the
troop withdrawal until power and telephones were restored.
   The <ORGANIZATION>St. Croix Board of Realtors</ORGANIZATION> in its annual meeting <DATE>Friday</DATE>
also denounced the withdrawal order and demanded the troops stay
until vital services are restored.
   A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>16th Brigade Batallion Command</ORGANIZATION>, one of the
units dispatched to <LOCATION>St. Croix</LOCATION>, said <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> that a small
contingent of the <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION> would arrive <DATE>Nov. 13</DATE> to replace
the federal troops.
   Hugo destroyed most homes and caused more than <MONEY>$500 million</MONEY> in
damage to <LOCATION>St. Croix</LOCATION>, an island of 50,000. It killed an estimated 56
people in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and 29 on the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> mainland.
