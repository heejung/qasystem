   In an emotional reunion 44 years later, <PERSON>George
Bush</PERSON> paid tribute to the his World War II <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> flying comrades and
the submarine crewmen who nicknamed him ``Ellie'' after pulling him
from the drink.
   Fireworks lit up the sky over the <LOCATION>Lincoln Memorial</LOCATION> as <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, about
to become the nation's 41st president, spent half an hour of quiet
reflection <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> with about three dozen of his war buddies.
   ``He spoke with great feeling about what the squadron and the
<ORGANIZATION>Finback</ORGANIZATION>'s crewmen meant to him,'' said retired Rear Adm. <PERSON>Lawrence
Heyworth</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Virginia Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION> ``<PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON>'s eyes kind of teared up
a little. It was very intimate.''
   <PERSON>Heyworth</PERSON> was gunnery and torpedo officer aboard the <ORGANIZATION>USS Finback</ORGANIZATION>
in <DATE>September 1944</DATE> when <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was one of five young <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> aviators
rescued by the submarine after being shot down by the Japanese over
the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has accorded the Finback veterans, the widows of a few
others and an equal number of members of his aircraft carrier
<ORGANIZATION>Torpedo Squadron</ORGANIZATION> VT-51 from World War II the choicest seats at
several inaugural events.
   But first he welcomed them to his temporary quarters at the <ORGANIZATION>Blair
House</ORGANIZATION> across <LOCATION>Pennsylvania Avenue</LOCATION> from the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> for a private
reunion.
   ``It was very emotional,'' said <PERSON>Don Kohler</PERSON>, 64, of <ORGANIZATION>Rogers</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Ark.</LOCATION>,
the submarine torpedoman who helped pull <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> out of his bobbing
orange life raft onto the deck of the Finback after he had bailed
out of his flaming torpedo bomber on <DATE>Sept. 2, 1944</DATE>.
   ``You have to remember that few of us had seen any of the others
from the Finback for 44 years,'' <PERSON>Kohler</PERSON> said. ``And meeting under
these circumstances where the president-elect personally welcomes
us, it was pretty moving.''
   <PERSON>Kohler</PERSON> said <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> told the group that ``the youngness that was
there all those years ago and the things we were fighting for had a
great deal to do with directing his life and ideas.''
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> spent a few moments with each of the veterans, signing
pictures, looking at their scrapbooks, swapping remembrances.
   Heyworth quoted <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> as saying: ``If it weren't for you people in
this room, I wouldn't be here and I certainly wouldn't have been
elected president of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.''
   <PERSON>Hugo Parkman</PERSON>, 69, of <ORGANIZATION>Stone Mountain</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Finback</ORGANIZATION>'s
communications officer, recalled <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> as ``a very clean-cut young
man.''
   ``I shared my bunk with him,'' <PERSON>Parkman</PERSON> said. ``That is, when I
was on duty, he slept, and when he was on duty I slept. On a
submarine everything's so tight, bunks don't get cold.''
   ``He was a very regular guy,'' said <PERSON>Parkman</PERSON>. ``We never knew that
he came from a distinguished family. He didn't tell anybody anything
about that.''
   W.E. ``Bill'' <PERSON>Edwards</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Bay St. Louis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Miss.</LOCATION>, an insurance agent
and retired <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> commander, recalled that <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was nicknamed
``Ellie'' by the submarine's crewmen because he would imitate a
braying elephant. But it had nothing to do with his aspiring
politics.
   ``We had a nickname for everyone aboard, and <PERSON>George</PERSON> was a very
smart, fun loving guy,'' <PERSON>Edwards</PERSON> said. ``He was always joking,
mimicking this elephant. I think he'd seen too many Tarzan movies.''
   Then a 20-year-old lieutenant and the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>'s youngest pilot, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>
was flying a bombing run against a Japanese radio communications
center in the <LOCATION>Bonin Islands</LOCATION> 600 miles south of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> when enemy fire
struck his TBM Avenger. He later won a Distinguished Flying Cross
for completing the run before bailing out of the flaming plane.

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON> was getting his early
morning exercise walking down a <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> street, when someone
gave a cry of recognition: ``Hey, isn't that <PERSON>Caliguiri</PERSON>?''
   No, it wasn't <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>Richard Caliguiri</PERSON>: It was the
front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination.
   ``I guess the mayor and I look alike,'' <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> said as he
described the <DATE>Sunday</DATE> morning greeting. ``There's an old saying in
Italian: `One face _ one race.' We're all part of the same family.''
   Far ahead in the polls here for <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s primary, <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> said
the incident shows ``we need to do a lot of work to make sure
people know who <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> is on the ballot.''
   The <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> governor himself is working hard _ taking a
whistle-stop train tour across western <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> and
making a six-city flying tour of the state today.
   Dukakis is looking for a fourth straight big-state win here over
his surviving competitor _ <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON> _ to tighten his grip on
the front-runner's crown and widen his margin in the delegate count.
   ``If we can win big here <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, it will give us a tremendous
boost,'' <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> told a big crowd of students on the <ORGANIZATION>Pennsylvania
State University</ORGANIZATION> campus, who were welcoming back his wife, <PERSON>Kitty</PERSON>, a
<ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> graduate.
   Through the cold, cloudy day in <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Greensburg</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Johnstown</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Altoona</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> hit over and over again on his
message of good jobs and economic development in a region
devastated by changes in the steel and coal industries.
   ``If we can't bring good jobs and economic opportunity back to
the Johnstowns of this country, then there is something the matter
with us,'' he told a crowd there. ``I believe we can. I believe
we're going to.''
   Dukakis drew the parallels between <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION>'s economic
troubles of the past and <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>'s troubles of the present.
   ``As a <LOCATION>New Englander</LOCATION>, we went through the same kind of pain and
economic distress as you have,'' he said in <LOCATION>Greensburg</LOCATION>. ``Our
communities have come back and these communities are going to come
back.''
   Drawing on the two <DATE>weekend</DATE> debates between the Democrats,
<PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> talked of how he and <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> agree on many issues.
   ``Instead of investing in a lot of exotic weapon systems of very
marginal value, we've got to take these resources and put them _ as
both Rev. <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> and I said <DATE>Saturday</DATE> _ into our infrastructure.''
   But on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> brushed off suggestions from <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> that
he should put out a budget.
   ``You can't prepare a budget now for next year _ that's
absurd,'' he told reporters on the chartered <ORGANIZATION>Amtrak</ORGANIZATION> train,
nicknamed the ``<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> Presidential Unlimited.''
   And <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> resisted pressure from a new Jackson tactic, urging
massive new spending on education, drug control efforts and other
programs.
   The front-runner went down his own list of education programs _
which he says involve only modest spending increases _ while
<PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> said the federal government should double its spending on
education.
   ``We're not going to run the nation's school system from
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> said. ``The thing a president has to do is to
set some priorities and get after them.''
   The Democratic candidate also took a couple of swipes at <PERSON>George
Bush</PERSON>, saying that the Republican nominee-to-be seems more
interested in building aircraft carriers than in rebuilding the
nation's railroads and highways.
   ``<PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> was critical of me ... because I oppose spending <MONEY>$36
billion</MONEY> on two supercarrier task forces that we don't need and we
can't afford,'' <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> said. ``If he thinks that's where we ought
to put our scarce resources, then so be it. But it's going to be a
fundamental issue in this campaign.
   ``I think I know where the American people are _ they are tired
of crumbling bridges, congested airports, jammed highways, homeless
people on streets and in doorways ... and they want a change.''
   If <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> is the Democratic nominee, perhaps he will get a wish
expressed wistfully in <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>.
   ``All of you know me. I suppose we'd all like to suppose that
I'm a household word,'' he told the small crowd. ``I'd like one of
these days to come to <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> and hear, `Hey, isn't that
<PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>?'''

SHAKING YOUR FAMILY TREE: GERMAN ANCESTOR'S ENGLISH NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRA V. GORMLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: My ancestor, <PERSON>William Felton</PERSON>, was born in the lowlands of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> 
about <DATE>1770</DATE> and arrived in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> in <DATE>1776</DATE> with his parents and two older 
brothers, <PERSON>John</PERSON> and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON>. The parents supposedly died shortly thereafter, 
probably in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>. What puzzles me is that <PERSON>Felton</PERSON> is not a German name, 
and I have been unable to find this family on ship passenger lists from 
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>. My ancestor was bound to a man who raised him in the Presbyterian 
faith. Is it possible he took another name? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Anything is possible in genealogy. Felton is an English location name; 
from Old English meaning feld (pasture or open country) plus tun (enclosure). 
It also is spelled <PERSON>Felten</PERSON>, and to add to the confusion, there is a German 
surname spelled <PERSON>Felten</PERSON> or Feldten. 
</P>
<P>
However, with sons named <PERSON>John</PERSON>, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> and <LOCATION>William</LOCATION>, I suspect your family is of 
English origins even though your ancestor supposedly was born in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
You need to make a thorough check in the probate and orphans' court records in 
the county where your immigrant ancestors died. Therein may be additional 
information on this line's origins. 
</P>
<P>
Ship passenger records are not complete for this time period. Examine the <DATE>1790</DATE> 
Census for <PERSON>Felton</PERSON> and Feltin families. There were 53 heads of households with 
this surname -- most of them in <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION>, but four were in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> at 
that time. The older brothers probably were heads of household when the <DATE>1790</DATE> 
Census was taken, and it may be necessary to research them to learn more about 
your ancestor. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My maiden name was <PERSON>Musick</PERSON>, which my father says may have been of Czech 
origin. I have seen it spelled Muzik also. Great-grandpa was born in <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> 
about <DATE>1856</DATE> in <LOCATION>St. Joseph</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Jefferson City</LOCATION>. Do you have any clues to this 
name's origins? 
</P>
<P>
A: Musick or Music is Polish for peasant or vassal. However, <PERSON>Muzik</PERSON> is Czech -- 
an affectionate nickname for a man of short stature. 
</P>
<P>
These names would have sounded alike to American record-keepers, so your family 
tradition of being Czech is most likely correct. Since your family settled in 
<LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> in the mid-1800s, they probably came during the time of mass 
immigration of Czechs -- who came due to the drought and crop failures in the 
<DATE>1840s</DATE> and a revolution in <DATE>1848</DATE>. Possibly your family left from the ports of 
<LOCATION>Hamburg</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Bremen</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and sailed either to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Galveston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tex</LOCATION>. 
Many Czechs settled in small towns and villages in <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>. Examine the <DATE>1850</DATE> 
and <DATE>1860</DATE> census records of <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> for more clues; and check for 
naturalization papers. Look for all spellings of your name. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Can you tell me the origins of the surname <PERSON>Hendricks</PERSON>? 
</P>
<P>
A: <PERSON>Hendricks</PERSON>, also found spelled <ORGANIZATION>Hendrick</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Hendrich</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Hendrix</LOCATION>, is of German 
origins, meaning a descendant of <PERSON>Heinrich</PERSON>, the German form of <ORGANIZATION>Henry</ORGANIZATION>, which 
literally means "home, rule." German surnames were originally formed from two 
roots that often have unrelated meanings. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My surname is <PERSON>Fant</PERSON>, which I seldom find. My folks were Swedes, but this name 
does not sound Swedish. Is it? 
</P>
<P>
A: <PERSON>Fant</PERSON> has some English roots, as a nickname, meaning an immature person, one 
with the characteristics of a child. However, the name could have been derived 
from "Infante" of Italian and Spanish origins. 
</P>
<P>
How your father's Swedish family came to acquire this name will require a 
fascinating research into genealogical records.

<HEAD>Archeologists Uncover Remains of Capital's Red-Light District</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archeologists digging just three blocks from
the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> have unearthed thousands of relics from <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s
notorious old red-light district, where Civil War prostitutes earned
their nickname entertaining Gen. <PERSON>Joseph Hooker</PERSON>'s troops.
   Shoveling beneath an asphalt parking lot just south of
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania Avenue</LOCATION> in the shadow of the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION> this
<DATE>summer</DATE>, investigators found perfume bottles, gaudy buttons, costume
jewelry, garter hooks and a long-forgotten cellar full of whiskey
and beer bottles.
   There was even a tiny, antique <PERSON>Bromo Seltzer</PERSON> bottle for treating
a morning-after malaise.
   Besides these artifacts of the hookers' trade, the investigators
discovered a wide assortment of everyday objects left by common
laborers, immigrants, runaway slaves and other poor folk who once
inhabited the crime-ridden neighborhood known as ``Murder Bay'' in
the mid-19th century.
   The six-week dig was completed just before <DATE>Labor Day</DATE>. Experts
have begun the year-long task of cleaning, cataloging and analyzing
the more than 250,000 objects recovered from the downtown site for
clues to the lifestyle of the humble people who lived there more
than a century ago.
   ``Nobody famous lived here. There's no `<ORGANIZATION>George Washington Slept
Here</ORGANIZATION>','' said <PERSON>Donna Seifert</PERSON>, principal archeologist with <ORGANIZATION>John Milner
Associates Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a historic preservation firm based in <LOCATION>West Chester</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, which conducted the dig.
   ``These were ordinary working folk, and this is one of those rare
opportunities to learn more about what their lives were really
like,'' she said.
   They lived in a hotbed of vice, gambling and rum running in a
squalid community of row houses and alley shanties between 14th and
13th streets, across <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> Avenue from the <ORGANIZATION>National Theater</ORGANIZATION>
and some of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s fanciest hotels and offices.
   Hooker, the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> commander defending the capital against
Confederate forces, tried to control the army of prostitutes
following his troops by herding the women into <LOCATION>Murder Bay</LOCATION>, away from
his encampment outside the city. The district became known as
``Hooker's Division,'' and its ladies of the night took the name of
``hookers.''
   A newspaper article from the <DATE>1890s</DATE>, which <PERSON>Ms. Seifert</PERSON> acquired
from the <ORGANIZATION>Library of Congress</ORGANIZATION>, declared that the area was ``the
plague spot of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'' with 109 brothels and 50 saloons.
   ``<PERSON>Grover Cleveland</PERSON> can sit in his bedroom window at the <ORGANIZATION>White
House</ORGANIZATION> and survey this entire territory,'' the paper said. ``He is
within sight and gunshot of each of these 109 dens which defy the
laws which he is supposed to execute through his commissioners.''
   The prostitutes packed their bags when <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> outlawed brothels
in the <ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1914</DATE>, and the site was razed in the
<DATE>late 1920s</DATE>. Plans to build a monumental plaza were abandoned in the
Depression, and the area was paved over in <DATE>1931</DATE> to create a
1,300-car parking lot.
   Construction is expected to begin in the <DATE>fall of 1990</DATE> on a
multimillion-dollar federal office building and international
cultural and arts center at the site.
   Because government funds are involved, the developer _ the
<ORGANIZATION>Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corp.</ORGANIZATION> _ is required by the <DATE>1966</DATE>
National Historic Preservation Act to review the project for its
impact on cultural resources.
   The archeologists hired for the job consulted old maps, census
records and city directories, and began excavating in mid-July in
their search for backyard ``trash pits'' behind the former wooden
and brick rowhouses.
   They uncovered an old cellar from a rooming house whose boarders
included several prostitutes, and salvaged about 200 empty beer and
liquor bottles. Among the popular brands a century ago were <ORGANIZATION>Pabst
Milwaukee</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Schlitz</ORGANIZATION> and ``<PERSON>John Fitzmorris</PERSON> Old Berwick Rye,'' plus
several earthenware jugs of German-brand ginger beer.
   Also found were fish, chicken and steak bones, many dating back
to the Civil War.
   <PERSON>Ms. Seifert</PERSON> says these and other mundane objects uncovered will
yield valuable information about the denizens of the former gambling
dens, saloons, brothels and boarding houses _ what they ate and
drank, what clothing they wore, how they spent their leisure time.
   ``We know how <PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON> set his table at <LOCATION>Monticello</LOCATION> and
who his guests were, for example, but we don't know very much about
the everyday dining habits of the ordinary people who lived in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>,'' she said.
   ``The documents tell us nothing about how they lived. And these
people did not save and cherish their household items, as the
wealthy did. They were used until they were broken or worn out, and
then thrown away.''

<TEXT>
   The bumper stickers bragged, ``Nothing could
be finer than to eat at <ORGANIZATION>Digger</ORGANIZATION>'s Diner.'' Now it's a diner to go.
   Anyone willing to flip flapjacks and hamburgers _ and pay the
cost of moving it _ can have the 1940s-vintage restaurant free of
charge, says <PERSON>William</PERSON> ``Digger'' Young.
   He grew tired of the diner chores because he also was juggling
jobs as a mortician, <PERSON>Butler</PERSON> County coroner, and ``Clown on Roller
Skates'' at children's hospitals and nursing homes.
   ``It's just that I wore too many hats. I'd ... put an apron on
over my suit and pour coffee. You didn't catch me cooking, but I'd
be running the cash register. I liked to be where the money was,''
he said.
   Young, 55, got his nickname from the funeral business his family
has owned since <DATE>1896</DATE>.
   His funeral home is next to the diner, painted brown and yellow
to match. But the location is purely coincidental. Unlike the
funeral business, <ORGANIZATION>Young</ORGANIZATION>'s diner brought customers back, before it
closed a few years ago.
   ``We had great food. Some of my customers were seven days a
week. Some would have breakfast and their evening meals there,
too,'' he said.
   Young wants to use the land occupied by the diner to expand the
funeral home and has been trying to sell the all-steel building for
two years. When no buyers nibbled, he decided to give it away and
placed newspaper ads that offered it ``free for the moving.''
   So far, the response has been pretty dead because no one has
been willing to pay the <MONEY>several thousand dollars</MONEY> necessary to have
the diner dismantled and moved, <PERSON>Young</PERSON> said.
   ``When they find out what it will cost to move it, they don't
seem to want to go any further,'' he said.
   The diner is the all-American variety, a <ORGANIZATION>Jerry O'Mahoney Inc.</ORGANIZATION>
special from <LOCATION>Elizabeth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, with curvaceous lines, stainless
steel trim, vinyl-covered stools and formica counters. It arrived
in <PERSON>Butler</PERSON> on two flatbed trucks in the early <DATE>1940s</DATE> and had several
owners until Young bought it seven years ago.
   The pie was homemade, the burgers thick and the cereal came in
little boxes.
   But now all that's left is the building. Young sold the
refrigerators and countertops to a pizza restaurant in <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>,
the pizza oven to a <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> campground, and the stoves, grill
and cash register to a <LOCATION>Youngstown</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, restaurant.
   ``Nobody would come in and take the whole place,'' he said.
``Then it got to be that I just started stripping things apart.''
   Stale cake donuts, paper doilies and a baby's yellow rattle
litter the dirty floor, and the walls in the kitchen area are
coated with decades of grease.
   But Young says there's still plenty of life in the diner, which,
with its concrete floor and industrial-strength walls, seems built
to last.
   ``There's stainless inside, good stainless,'' he said, picking
through the rubble to reveal an old menu. ``Paint that steel and
polish the stainless and you have a pretty good looking building.''
   But more than anything, it was an institution in this bustling
western <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> city of about 17,000. As a teen-ager, <ORGANIZATION>Young</ORGANIZATION>
remembers well the lines that formed outside.
   ``People waited to get in. It was a very busy diner,'' he said.
   When Young ran the diner, it featured such culinary specialties
as the ``Digger Special'' _ a hamburger topped with a fried egg and
sauteed mushrooms, his favorite.
   Speaking of his decision to give the diner away, he said, ``I'd
like to see it used someplace, and I'd go past and say, `That used
to be mine.'''

<TEXT>
   Democrat <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON> said today he would
talk with terrorists holding hostages but ``never make
concessions,'' commenting one day after campaign rival <PERSON>Jesse
Jackson</PERSON> criticized what he said was <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>' view that ``we should
not negotiate with terrorists.''
   Jackson set off the exchange <DATE>Sunday</DATE> when he said, ``I've raised
the point in several debates this year. Every time a question comes
up about terrorism, <PERSON>Mr. Dukakis</PERSON> says, `I'm against terrorism. ...
We should not negotiate with terrorists. ... In the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION>,
never negotiate with terrorists.'
   ``I disagree with that; If I could get the hostages out, I'd do
it.''
   Dukakis, in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, told reporters today after being asked
about <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>'s statement, ``I think we need a tough anti-terrorist
policy. ...
   ``I don't have a problem with talking, but you never make
concessions to terrorists _ ever. If you do, what you end up with
is hostage-taking and terrorism all over the world.''
   Jackson, asked today about negotiating with terrorists, said he
would not make ``material concessions'' to them but could conceive
of situations in which he would grant hostage-takers safe passage.
   ``I would never exchange arms for hostages,'' he said, a
reference to the Iran-Contra operations steered by <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>
administration officials.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> policy holds that American officials ``will talk to any
official or group about the safety and release of hostages but we
will not make concessions,'' a <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said
<DATE>today</DATE>.
   The gentle battling between the surviving Democratic candidates
got more direct as the candidates closed in on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s
delegate-rich <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> primary.
   A new poll, sponsored by <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>'s KYW-TV and <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>'s
KDKA-TV, showed <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> apparently increasing his lead among likely
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> Democratic voters. In the new poll, taken by telephone
over the <DATE>weekend</DATE>, <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> led <LOCATION>Jackson</LOCATION> <PERCENT>57 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>31 percent</PERCENT> with
<PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> still undecided.
   Last week, with <PERSON>Sen. Albert Gore Jr.</PERSON> still being counted,
<PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> led <LOCATION>Jackson</LOCATION> <PERCENT>45 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>34 percent</PERCENT>, with <PERCENT>14 percent</PERCENT>
undecided and <PERCENT>7 percent</PERCENT> for Gore. The polls, with a margin of error
of five percentage points either way, were conducted by <ORGANIZATION>KRC
Research</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>.
   It was <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> who has stirred the biggest controversy in recent
days with his call on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> for negotiation with anyone to free
hostages.
   ``In this world, in this ambiguous world, you must not set up
preconditions that stop effectiveness,'' <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> said at a rally in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. ``I would meet with anyone I could meet with to get the
hostages out of <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION>.''
   Eight Americans are currently held hostage by Moslem extremists
in <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION>.
   On <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> did a whistle-stop tour of <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, but
he was switching to the air <DATE>today</DATE>, hitting six cities to make an
impression in every media market in the state before the voters go
to the polls <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   Jackson raised money in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> before returning late <DATE>Sunday</DATE>
for a final push in the <ORGANIZATION>Keystone State</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> has a big lead in the polls in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, where 178
delegates are at stake. The complicated process _ with delegates
elected individually _ offers a challenge to voters who may have to
pull the lever up to 12 times. But it also offers <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>, if he
does well, a chance to win as many as 100 more delegates than
<PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>.
   ``You've got to vote more than once. This is the one time you
can do so legally,'' he told students at <ORGANIZATION>Penn State University in
State College</ORGANIZATION>. ``Vote early and often _ vote for me and vote for my
delegates.''
   Dukakis is more than half the way to a delegate majority,
holding 1,075.15 national convention votes. <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> has 836.1 while
599.75 were uncommitted. A tally of 2,081 or more is needed to win
the nomination at the <DATE>July</DATE> convention in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>.
   Guam's three convention votes entered the uncommitted column
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> evening following caucuses on the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> island.
   On the Republican side, Vice President <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> is virtually
unchallenged on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, when he may win enough of
the 78 delegates at stake to go over the magic majority mark _
1,139 _ needed to win the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> nomination in <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION> in <DATE>August</DATE>.
   A new poll by <ORGANIZATION>Time magazine</ORGANIZATION> indicates that a Dukakis-Jackson
ticket would get <PERCENT>47 percent</PERCENT> of the vote nationwide to <PERCENT>42 percent</PERCENT>
for a Republican ticket headed by <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>.
   A Dukakis-Gore ticket would defeat Bush <PERCENT>49 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>39
percent</PERCENT>, but <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> would defeat <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> by <PERCENT>52 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>34 percent</PERCENT>,
according to the poll released <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   On the Democratic side, <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> have been unusually
cordial recently, but the best-friends atmosphere thinned when
<PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> urged <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> to release a proposed budget.
   ``I'm not just for Head Start, I'm willing to pay for Head
Start,'' <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> said during the debate <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> in
<LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>. ``I have put numbers together to pay for my dreams.''
   Dukakis strongly disagreed.
   ``You can't prepare a budget now for next year _ that's
absurd,'' he told reporters <DATE>Sunday</DATE> on his chartered <ORGANIZATION>Amtrak</ORGANIZATION> train,
nicknamed the ``<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> Presidential Unlimited.''
   ``I'll lay out where I'm going to make the cuts _ I've done that
in great detail,'' <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> said as he toured western <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Hobos Reunite In Iowa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRITT, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Midwest <PERSON>John</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Ohio Ned</LOCATION>, Steam Train <PERSON>Maury
Graham</PERSON> and others are spreading their bedrolls this weekend in
<LOCATION>Britt</LOCATION>, home of the <ORGANIZATION>National Hobo Convention</ORGANIZATION>.
   About 40 hobos from across the country hitchhiked and hopped
freights to be on hand for ceremonies, including funerals for two
``brothers'' buried in the town cemetery.
   ``It's a homecoming of sorts. We're a vanishing breed. There's
no young guys out here anymore,'' said 36-year-old <PERSON>John Becker</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Sterling</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, known as <LOCATION>Midwest John</LOCATION>.
   Becker's traveling partner, <PERSON>Ned McNamer</PERSON> of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, said
life on the road is getting more dangerous. Both men wear long
sheath knives hidden underneath sleeveless jean jackets covered
with souvenir buttons.
   ``We came here from the <LOCATION>North Town</LOCATION> rail yards in <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>.
That's a real jungle,'' said <PERSON>McNamer</PERSON>, who sports the name <ORGANIZATION>Ohio Ned</ORGANIZATION>.
``In some parts of the country you could get killed for anything _
rings, shoes _ you name it.''
   ``It's a little lonely, sure. But it all depends on what your
tastes are. If you like a 9 to 5 job, fancy slacks, that's nice,
too,'' <PERSON>Becker</PERSON> said. ``But for some of us there's always that urge
to see what's up over the hill.''
   The hobos, mostly men, wore red bandanas, caps and many carried
sturdy walking staffs. They gathered <DATE>Friday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>Evergreen
Cemetery</ORGANIZATION> for services for the <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> Kid and <LOCATION>Hafey</LOCATION> the Bo.
They are the fourth and fifth hobos to be buried at the Britt
cemetery. A tombstone also sits in the cemetery for all unknown
hobos who have died.
   ``We remember all of our deceased hobos, those who in hobo
terminology, `have caught the westbound,''' said a hobo named
<ORGANIZATION>Frisco Jack</ORGANIZATION>.
   Members of the <ORGANIZATION>Britt American Legion</ORGANIZATION> fired a rifle salute and
blew taps for the Kid, whose real name was <PERSON>Paul Wilson</PERSON>. <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON>, a
World War II veteran from <LOCATION>Franklin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, died in <DATE>June</DATE> at age 80.
   Whiskey was sprinkled on his tombstone.
   ``I know some people may look down on it, but it was what he
requested,'' <PERSON>Graham</PERSON> told the other hobos and a crowd of about 50
who attended the hourlong service.
   ``People think hobos don't make friends. But that is the main
point of our lives. Friends are the wealth of life,'' said <PERSON>Graham</PERSON>,
a short man with a long white beard and mustache who was crowned
King of the Hobos in <DATE>1973</DATE>.
   ``<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> Kid was the only man I knew who shaved with
broken glass. He'd get a piece from a broken bottle, wrap it up in
toilet paper and put it in his pocket,'' said <PERSON>Graham</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Toledo</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, native.
   Hafey the Bo, whose real name was <PERSON>Al Zale</PERSON>, was a hobo from <LOCATION>Los
Angeles</LOCATION> who got his nickname because he suffered from chronic hay
fever. He was remembered as a kind and gentle man.
   ``We're going to miss those guys,'' said the <ORGANIZATION>El Paso Kid</ORGANIZATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Hobo Convention</ORGANIZATION> first came to Britt in <DATE>1900</DATE> when
Thos. A. Way, <PERSON>T.A. Potter</PERSON> and <PERSON>W.E. Bradford</PERSON> decided to do something
to show the world that <PERSON>Britt</PERSON> was a lively little town capable of
doing anything larger cities could do. The convention became a
fixture in <DATE>1933</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Britt Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION>, which runs a small hobo museum in
the lobby of the defunct Old Chief Theatre, plans to expand the
museum to honor hobos, said <PERSON>Marian Malek</PERSON>, chamber secretary. Plans
also call to move the five graves of the hobos to a reserved
section of the cemetery.
   ``Hobos are a decent lot. We are not bums,'' said <PERSON>Joe Baker</PERSON>, 59,
a hobo from <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>. ``I've known no other life since I was
13.''
   ``Hobos have hearts, too, and they cry and laugh like everybody
else,'' <PERSON>Graham</PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Bush's Wartime Rescuers Remember Him as `Ellie the Elephant'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> may be the Big Elephant in the
inaugural parade next week, but his buddies on a World War II
submarine remember him as ``Ellie the Elephant,'' the fun-loving
young <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> pilot they rescued from the <LOCATION>Pacific Ocean</LOCATION> <DATE>44 years ago</DATE>.
   Surviving crew members of the USS Finback are looking forward to
a nostalgic reunion with <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> here next <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, two days before
they watch him take the presidential oath of office on the <LOCATION>West
Front</LOCATION> steps of the Capitol.
   Inaugural planners have passed the word to several Finback
veterans that <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> is setting aside time to meet with them at <ORGANIZATION>Blair
House</ORGANIZATION>, across the street from the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>, to swap war stories
and renew old acquaintances.
   Prime bleacher seats have been reserved for the inaugural parade
<DATE>Friday</DATE> down <LOCATION>Pennsylvania Avenue</LOCATION> for nearly 30 survivors of the
Finback crew, plus several of <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s old fellow pilots, who are
expected to attend the inauguration.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was nicknamed ``Ellie'' by the <ORGANIZATION>Finback</ORGANIZATION>'s officers for his
wardroom imitation of a trumpeting elephant.
   ``It wasn't because we all sat around thinking we were
Republicans,'' said retired Rear Adm. <PERSON>Lawrence Heyworth</PERSON>, 67, of
<LOCATION>Virginia Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, who was the <ORGANIZATION>Finback</ORGANIZATION>'s torpedo and gunnery
officer.
   ``We must have seen one in a Tarzan movie. We just thought
elepants were funny. We kept asking <PERSON>George</PERSON> to do it over and over
again.''
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was plucked from the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sept. 2, 1944</DATE>, shortly after
he bailed out of his flaming Grumman Avenger torpedo bomber over the
<LOCATION>Bonin Islands</LOCATION> 600 miles south of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> won the Distinguished Flying Cross for heroism during the
bombing raid against an enemy radio communications center. The
citation noted that <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, then only 20, completed his dive and hit
his target even after his plane was hit and engulfed in smoke. His
two crew members were lost.
   ``At that time, he was just another downed pilot,'' said <PERSON>Don
Kohler</PERSON>, 64, of <ORGANIZATION>Rogers</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Ark.</LOCATION>, the torpedoman who helped pull <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> out
of his bobbing orange life raft to the safety of the <ORGANIZATION>Finback</ORGANIZATION>'s deck.
``Nobody back then knew he'd become president of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.''
   During the month he spent on the Finback before saying goodbye at
<LOCATION>Midway Island</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> eagerly took his turn at night lookout watches
and other seagoing duties, watched <PERSON>Betty Grable</PERSON> movies in the
wardroom and donned earphones to listen in awe as the submarine's
torpedoes sank two enemy ships.
   Retired <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON>W.E.</PERSON> ``Bill'' <PERSON>Edwards</PERSON>, who filmed <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s
rescue with a <ORGANIZATION>Kodak</ORGANIZATION> movie camera from the <ORGANIZATION>Finback</ORGANIZATION>'s conning tower,
remembers <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s surprise that his first meal on the submarine that
night was filet mignon and fresh strawberry shortcake with whipped
cream.
   ``He said he'd been eating nothing but Spam and beans on the
carriers,'' <PERSON>Edward</PERSON>, 67, said in a telephone interview from his
retirement home at <LOCATION>Bay St. Louis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Miss</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was one of three <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> pilots rescued by the Finback during
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> carrier raids against the <LOCATION>Bonin Islands</LOCATION> in early <DATE>September</DATE>.
   ``I remember he was very lively, obviously intelligent and very
personable,'' said <PERSON>Heyworth</PERSON>. ``All three pilots we rescued were
bright, bright-eyed young men, but <PERSON>George</PERSON> seemed the most outgoing
and had the most ebullient personality. He was the most
entertaining, and he made us laugh a lot.''

<HEAD>Bell Atlantic Workers Join NYNEX, PacTel In Striking; BellSouth Settles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A union representing 41,000 telephone workers at <LOCATION>Bell Atlantic</LOCATION>
walked off the job <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, joining counterparts at <ORGANIZATION>NYNEX
Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Pacific Telesis</LOCATION> who had begun a strike hours earlier,
union and company spokesmen said.
   <PERSON>Mary O'Hara</PERSON>, district coordinator in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> for the
<ORGANIZATION>Communications Workers of America</ORGANIZATION>, said talks with <ORGANIZATION>Bell Atlantic</ORGANIZATION>
broke up around <TIME>6:45 a.m.</TIME> and pickets were being set up.
   Bell <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, is parent to local phone
companies in <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>District of Columbia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New
Jersey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>.
   Talks continued <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> between another union, the
<ORGANIZATION>International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers</ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION>Bell
Atlantic</ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Tom
Duddy</PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Bell of Pennsylvania</ORGANIZATION>. That union represents
11,000 operators and clerical workers at the two subsidiaries.
   Hours earlier, more than 100,000 <ORGANIZATION>CWA</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>IBEW</ORGANIZATION> workers walked out
at New York-based <ORGANIZATION>NYNEX</ORGANIZATION> and San Francisco-based <LOCATION>Pacific Telesis</LOCATION>.
   A tentative agreement was reached between the <ORGANIZATION>CWA</ORGANIZATION> and a fourth
regional telephone company, Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION>BellSouth</ORGANIZATION>, which employs
64,000 union workers and provides phone service in nine states in
the Southeast.
   Officials have said that most direct-dial telephone calls would
not be affected by phone company walkouts, because they are handled
by automated equipment, but customers could expect delays in
directory assistance calls, operator-assisted calls and in service
and installation jobs.
   In all, 221,000 telecommunications workers were covered by the
talks to replace contracts that expired at <TIME>11:59 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. The
four companies provide service to 24 states and the nation's
capital.
   The regional telephone companies, nicknamed ``Baby Bells,'' were
created by the <DATE>1984</DATE> breakup of <ORGANIZATION>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph</ORGANIZATION>.
   Contracts with three of the other ``Baby Bells'' _ <ORGANIZATION>Ameritech</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>US
West</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Southwestern Bell</ORGANIZATION> _ expire next <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. Those three
companies employ 131,000 union workers and provide phone service in
24 states.
   The unions announced the strike against New York-based <ORGANIZATION>NYNEX</ORGANIZATION>
well before the 11:59 EDT deadline, saying myriad differences
remained. So great were the differences that no formal talks were
held <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>NYNEX</ORGANIZATION> serves seven Northeast states: <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> and parts of
<LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION>CWA</ORGANIZATION> represents 40,000 <ORGANIZATION>NYNEX</ORGANIZATION> workers; <ORGANIZATION>IBEW</ORGANIZATION> 20,000.
   Talks with <LOCATION>Pacific Telesis</LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, were held
throughout the day but the unions announced the strike there at
<TIME>midnight _ 3 a.m. EDT</TIME>.
   <LOCATION>Pacific Telesis</LOCATION> is parent company of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Bell
Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Nevada Bell Telephone Co</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>CWA</ORGANIZATION> represents 42,000 <LOCATION>Pacific
Telesis</LOCATION> workers; <ORGANIZATION>IBEW</ORGANIZATION> 2,500.

<HEADLINE>  INDIAN ISSUE MAY SOON COME TO A HEAD  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  High School Report; Additional information attached to the end of this article  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "At some phase, we'll be reacting to those types of issues at schools,"
<PERSON>Larry Gorospe</PERSON>, the new executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>American Indian Center of San
Jose</ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday.;   At issue is not only the use of Indian nicknames, but
also the way the nicknames are portrayed by team mascots.;   In particular,
members of the center believe that <ORGANIZATION>Fremont High</ORGANIZATION>'s bug-eyed, huge-nosed mascot
is demeaning.;   "It's really quite grotesque," <PERSON>Gorospe</PERSON> said after being
showed photos of the mascot. "It's not even a good caricature. The problem
with something like this, and in most forms of the media, is that it's a
negative stereotype of Indian people. And what this does is reinforce it. It
has a big nose. It looks almost like a monster.";   Added <PERSON>George Martin</PERSON>, a
local leader of the <ORGANIZATION>American Indian Movement</ORGANIZATION>, "That's the most disgraceful
thing I've seen in a long time. Is that supposed to be an Indian?";   The
mascot head was purchased from <LOCATION>Blackford</LOCATION> -- whose nickname was the Braves --
when that school closed last <DATE>spring</DATE>, according to <ORGANIZATION>Cipriano Sena</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION>'s
student activities director.;   Said Sena: "The kids were interested in it. .
. . We talked about it administratively, and we weren't too pleased about it,
either.";   Though <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said his group could picket schools or organizing
protests, <PERSON>Gorospe</PERSON> and <PERSON>Rosemary Cambra</PERSON>, chairwoman of the Muwekma-Ohlone tribe
of <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, said the best process is to educate people about Indians. <PERSON>Cambra</PERSON>
said she would like to see a partnership developed between Indian and other
community organizations.;   "I believe there is something wrong when certain
teams can use Indians, Braves and Warriors without the consent of the Indian
people," said <PERSON>Cambra</PERSON>, who hadn't seen the <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION> mascot.;   (Like Yerba
Buena, three other area schools use the nickname Warriors. But <ORGANIZATION>Westmont High</ORGANIZATION>'s
is a Spartan-type warrior, and <ORGANIZATION>Valley Christian</ORGANIZATION>'s and <ORGANIZATION>Fremont Christian</ORGANIZATION>'s
nicknames are intended as biblical warriors.);   The complaint of racial
insensitivity was the basis of Stanford changing its nickname from Indians to
Cardinals in <DATE>1972</DATE> (it became Cardinal in <DATE>'81</DATE>). In the <DATE>past two years</DATE>, three
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> high schools dropped Indian nicknames. Tamalpais of <LOCATION>Mill Valley</LOCATION>
went from the Indians to the <ORGANIZATION>Red Tailed Hawks</ORGANIZATION>, the Encina Apaches of
<LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> became the <LOCATION>Bulldogs</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Lowell</PERSON> of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> dropped Indians
and has no official nickname.;   <PERSON>Bernie Schneider</PERSON>, athletic director at
<ORGANIZATION>Tamalpais</ORGANIZATION>, said his school was caught up in the controversy for nearly a year
before changing nicknames.;   "We went through quite an investigation and had
many different discussions at different levels," said <PERSON>Schneider</PERSON>, whose
school's "Indians" nickname dated to <DATE>1908</DATE>. "We brought Native American groups
on campus to talk. . . . Even though our nickname glorified the bravery of
Indians, the Native American feeling was that they didn't want to be
stereotyped. They just wanted to be people.;   "It caused a lot of division
among our students. Mostly all of our alumni wanted to keep it.";   The only
battle in the <LOCATION>South Bay-Southern Alameda County</LOCATION> area that has already begun is
at <ORGANIZATION>Ohlone College</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION>. Two students, <PERSON>Hector Miecznikowski</PERSON> and <PERSON>Charmaine
Leonard</PERSON>, are leading an attempt to replace the school's nickname, the
Renegades. Miecznikowski said not only doesn't Renegades fit with the heritage
of the Ohlone Indians, but more important, it doesn't represent the school's
students.;   "I looked it up, and 'Renegades' basically means traitors," said
<PERSON>Miecznikowski</PERSON>. "That's totally different than what you'd think. We call
ourselves the <ORGANIZATION>Ohlone Traitors</ORGANIZATION>. That's grounds for change itself.";  
Meanwhile, at <ORGANIZATION>Yerba Buena</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Mission San Jose</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION>, the only issues
that have been raised regarding their nicknames have centered on their logos.
<PERSON>Brook Vasconcellos</PERSON>, <LOCATION>A.D.</LOCATION> and football coach at <LOCATION>Yerba Buena</LOCATION>, said he is
changing his team's logo to make it look like "a more dignified" Indian.;  
<PERSON>Benny Breazeale</PERSON>, student activities director at <LOCATION>Mission San Jose</LOCATION>, said the
only complaint he has heard in his four years at the school is that some
students want to use a female Indian logo in addition to the male Indian.;  
<PERSON>Vasconcellos</PERSON> and <PERSON>Breazeale</PERSON> said their schools represent Indians in a positive
manner. <PERSON>Phil Kelly</PERSON>, <LOCATION>A.D.</LOCATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Fremont High</ORGANIZATION>, said basically the same.;   "When
you take a nickname and don't demean it," <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> said, "I have a hard time with
(any flap).";   <PERSON>Gorospe</PERSON> doesn't.;   "Even if a mascot showed a traditional
Indian headdress and was noble looking," he said, "I still don't believe in
Indian people being mascots. People shouldn't be mascots, period.";  
<PERSON>Vasconcellos</PERSON> added that if the controversy filters down from <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Yerba
Buena</LOCATION>, he and other school officials wouldn't ignore it.;   "If something like
this was very upsetting to the community," he said, "we'd listen."; Name that

<HEAD>Bush Known as `Ellie the Elephant' After Wartime Rescue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Surviving crew members of the World War II
submarine Finback are looking forward to a nostalgic reunion with
<PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>, the young <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> pilot they dubbed ``Ellie the Elephant''
after rescuing him from the <LOCATION>Pacific Ocean</LOCATION> more than 44 years ago.
   <PERSON>Don Kohler</PERSON>, 64, of <ORGANIZATION>Rogers</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Ark.</LOCATION>, the torpedoman who helped pull a
grateful <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to safety from his orange life raft onto the <ORGANIZATION>Finback</ORGANIZATION>'s
deck, remembers offering a smile and a hearty ``welcome aboard,''
but recalls little else about the incident.
   ``At that time, he was just another downed pilot,'' said <PERSON>Kohler</PERSON>,
a retired <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> businessman. ``Nobody back then knew he'd become
president of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.''
   Rescued after his plane was shot down by Japanese fire, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>
eagerly took his turn at night lookout watches and other seagoing
duties, watched <PERSON>Betty Grable</PERSON> movies in the wardroom and donned
earphones to listen in awe as the submarine's torpedoes sank two
enemy ships.
   Former Finback officers remember the 20-year-old <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> as a
gregarious jokester who earned the nickname ``Ellie'' for his comic
wardroom imitation of a trumpeting elephant, they said in recent
telephone interviews.
   ``I remember he was very lively, obviously intelligent and very
personable,'' said retired Rear Adm. <PERSON>Lawrence Heyworth</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Virginia
Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, who was the <ORGANIZATION>Finback</ORGANIZATION>'s torpedo and gunnery officer when
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was hauled aboard on <DATE>Sept. 2, 1944</DATE>.
   Said <PERSON>Heyworth</PERSON>: ``All three pilots we rescued were bright,
bright-eyed young men, but <PERSON>George</PERSON> seemed the most outgoing and had
the most ebullient personality. He was the most entertaining, and he
made us laugh a lot.
   ``We called him <PERSON>Ellie</PERSON> because of his outstanding imitation of an
elephant trumpeting. Ellie the Elephant. It wasn't because we all
sat around thinking we were Republicans. We must have seen one in a
Tarzan movie. We just thought elephants were funny. We kept asking
<PERSON>George</PERSON> to do it over and over again.''
   ``He had a tremendous sense of humor,'' recalled <PERSON>W.E.</PERSON> ``Bill''
<PERSON>Edwards</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Bay St. Louis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Miss.</LOCATION>, an insurance agent and retired <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>
commander. As a bearded ensign aboard the <ORGANIZATION>Finback</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Edwards</PERSON> filmed
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s rescue with an 8mm <ORGANIZATION>Kodak</ORGANIZATION> movie camera.
   <PERSON>Edwards</PERSON> said that at last count, nearly 30 surviving officers and
enlisted crewmen of the Finback were planning to attend <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s
swearing-in at noontime <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE> at the <LOCATION>Capitol</LOCATION>.
   They and a few of <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s former flying buddies plan to sit
together in prime bleacher seats on <LOCATION>Pennsylvania Avenue</LOCATION> for the
inaugural parade after <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> takes the presidential oath of office.
   Inaugural officials reportedly were trying to arrange a reunion
for <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and his old submarine buddies at <ORGANIZATION>Blair House</ORGANIZATION>, the
presidential guest quarters across the street from the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>,
possibly next <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Heyworth</PERSON> and <PERSON>Edwards</PERSON> have stayed in touch with <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> over the
years. But most of the Finback veterans haven't seen or spoken to
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> since he left the submarine at <LOCATION>Midway Island</LOCATION> after a month-long
combat patrol.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> won the Distinguished Flying Cross for completing his
bombing run against a Japanese radio communications center in the
<LOCATION>Bonin Islands</LOCATION>, about 600 miles south of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, after his Grumman
Avenger torpedo bomber was struck by enemy fire and engulfed in
flames. <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> bailed out over the water but his two crew members were
lost.
   According to his autobiography, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s only injuries were a gash
on the forehead and a painful sting from a Portuguese man-of-war. He
was picked up by the Finback less than two hours after his parachute
hit the ocean.
   ``I'm proud of what I was able to do to help <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> on board
our boat,'' said <PERSON>Kohler</PERSON>.
   But <PERSON>Dan Moody</PERSON>, 71, a <ORGANIZATION>Finback</ORGANIZATION> veteran and retired radiation
laboratory technician living in <LOCATION>Albany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, gave little thought
to <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> at the time.
   ``We brought him aboard, dried him out and gave him hot coffee,''
he said, and then forgot him.
   ``I was 26 years old and a first class torpedoman,'' <ORGANIZATION>Moody</ORGANIZATION> said.
``Who'd pay any attention to a 20-year-old kid?''

<P>
I have just received my sample ballot for the upcoming (<DATE>June 5</DATE>) election. In 
reviewing the various candidates I note that entirely too many of them have 
cute little nicknames in parentheses. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it is old-fashioned to run for public office using your proper name. 
</P>
<P>
If the individuals in question were known better by the nickname it might be 
acceptable. However, in most cases the individuals have simply included the 
common informal name, i.e., <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> -- "Bob" or <PERSON>John</PERSON> -- "<PERSON>Jack</PERSON>." If this is a 
current ploy to win elections, I, for one, will not fall for it. 
</P>
<P>
If these individuals really think this will help voter recognition, I question 
their intelligence. I will vote for the "less cute" candidate and/or the one 
with the less placards attached to utility poles.

<HEAD>Radon's Shadow Remains Over Town That Put It on The Map</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID S. MARTIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOYERTOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly four years after radon from his
house caused <PERSON>Stanley Watras</PERSON> to set off radiation detectors at the
<LOCATION>Limerick</LOCATION> nuclear power plant, he wonders daily about his family's
health.
   ``There's a fine line between making yourself sick by worrying
and having a genuine concern and doing the best you can,'' said
<PERSON>Watras</PERSON>, 37, a technical adviser at the plant.
   Radon levels in <PERSON>Watras</PERSON>' home of 800 times the concentration
deemed hazardous first alerted environmental officials and
residents of southeastern <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> to the danger of indoor
radon concentration. Last week, the head of the <ORGANIZATION>Environmental
Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION> said the problem is more widespread than
previously believed and urged that every home in the country be
tested.
   Radon is a radioactive gas produced by the natural decaying of
uranium found in all soil and rock and usually dissipated
harmlessly into the atmosphere. It poses a health threat when it
seeps through the ground and collects in homes.
   The colorless, odorless gas could be responsible for 20,000 of
the nation's 130,000 annual lung cancer deaths, the <ORGANIZATION>EPA</ORGANIZATION> estimates.
It kills by leaving its own radioactive decay products in the lung,
irradiating the organs for a lifetime.
   Environmental officials first believed radon to be concentrated
along a geological formation known as the Reading Prong, a narrow
area of high-uranium soil stretching from Reading, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, across
northern <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> into <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> state.
   But a recent <ORGANIZATION>EPA</ORGANIZATION> survey in seven states and Indian land found
health-threatening levels of radon in <PERCENT>29 percent</PERCENT> of 11,000 homes
tested.
   The <ORGANIZATION>EPA</ORGANIZATION> has set 4 picocuries of radon per liter of air as a
guideline for determining when long-term exposure poses a health
threat. A picocurie is a measure of radiation. Exposure to 15
picocuries of radon for a lifetime is equivalent to smoking a pack
of cigarettes a day, the <ORGANIZATION>EPA</ORGANIZATION> says.
   A reading taken in the living room of <PERSON>Watras</PERSON>' modest,
split-level house in <DATE>December 1984</DATE> was 3,200 picocuries, the
highest ever recorded at a private home. <PERSON>Watras</PERSON>, his wife and two
young children were evacuated soon afterward.
   <PERSON>Tim Hartman</PERSON>, administrator of the state Radon Monitoring Program
set up several miles away in late <DATE>1985</DATE>, said the Watrases' house
was built inches above uranium-laden granite.
   ``He just had an ungodly concentration of radon spewing into his
home,'' <PERSON>Hartman</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Watras</PERSON> and his family returned to the house in <DATE>August 1985</DATE> after
a <MONEY>$32,600</MONEY> research project dramatically reduced the radon level.
Watras and his wife have since had a third child.
   ``At the beginning, we were saying, `Why us?' We were looking at
the children saying, `What did we do to you?''' Watras recalled in
an interview at his home last week.
   Watras now believes God put his family in the home for a purpose.
   ``What we've got to do from now on is try to help other
people,'' he said, calling his efforts to bring attention to radon
``a crusade.''
   Some of the other residents in his suburban <LOCATION>Berks County</LOCATION>
neighborhood, nicknamed <ORGANIZATION>Radon Hills</ORGANIZATION>, agree with him and have
organized to push for legislation protecting homes from the toxic
gas. Others believe the threat is overblown.
   <PERSON>Kay Jones</PERSON>, who lives down the street from <PERSON>Watras</PERSON>, is president
of <ORGANIZATION>Pennsylvanians Against Radon</ORGANIZATION>, a group with about 150 members.
   <PERSON>Ms. Jones</PERSON> believes national building codes should include radon
guidelines, wants public service advertisements that warn people
about the danger of radon and supports a law that would force a
family to leave a home when radon levels reach a certain point.
   Unless the government acts, people will forget about radon as
media interest wanes, she said.
   ``Right now, everything you pick up, it's radon, radon, radon,
but in two or three days it's going to die out,'' <PERSON>Ms. Jones</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Dennis Hess</PERSON>, another neighbor, is one of those skeptical about
the radon threat.
   ``I don't think I'm walking into a gas chamber when I walk into
my home. I'd like to think something else will get me before the
radon,'' said <PERSON>Hess</PERSON>, a 34-year-old machinist at a chemical plant.
   <PERSON>Hess</PERSON> hasn't measured the radon level in his home, and he said
environmental officials haven't been able to convince him that the
problem can't be alleviated by opening a few windows.
   No records exist of the number of people who have had their
homes refitted in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> to reduce the amount of radon in the
air. Hartman estimated the number was in the thousands, most of
them along the <LOCATION>Reading Prong</LOCATION>, where <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of the homes tested
had levels above 4 picocuries.
   Even when houses have been fixed, health worries remain.
   ``The fear never goes away,'' said <PERSON>Ms. Jones</PERSON>, whose family spent
five years in a home that recorded a radon level of 450 picocuries
before being fitted with a ventilation system. ``We're living in
the unknown.''

<HEAD>Officials Want To Change Town's Queen City Nickname</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARQUETTE, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Municipal leaders want to change their
town's ``Queen City'' nickname to ``Superior Location'' because
they think the current moniker might be misinterpreted.
   ``It has come to my attention that there has been a resurgence
of the use of the phrase `<ORGANIZATION>Queen City</ORGANIZATION>' to describe the city of
<LOCATION>Marquette</LOCATION>,'' City Manager <PERSON>David Svanda</PERSON> said in a recent letter to
community leaders.
   ``The term's negative connotations conjured by many people do
not give justice to all that the <LOCATION>Marquette</LOCATION> area has to offer.''
   Visitors might think <LOCATION>Queen City</LOCATION> refers to homosexuals, said
Mayor <PERSON>Robert Berube</PERSON>.
   Marquette historian <PERSON>Fred Rydholm</PERSON>, who is writing a history of
the Lake Superior port of 23,280 people, said that was silly.
Svanda's request is ``the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard,''
<PERSON>Rydholm</PERSON> said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Queen City</ORGANIZATION> nickname originated after a <DATE>1868</DATE> fire, when an
ordinance required all buildings in the center city area to be
rebuilt with stone or masonry, he said.
   Visitors expecting to see the wood construction of other <LOCATION>Upper
Peninsula</LOCATION> towns in <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> instead were greeted with tall spires
of stone.
   ``There was nothing from <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> like it in the
north, and it was also the best port on Lake Superior, so it was
called the <LOCATION>Queen City</LOCATION> of the North,'' <PERSON>Rydholm</PERSON> said.

<P>
When <PERSON>George</PERSON> and <PERSON>Barbara Bush</PERSON> set out from the Capitol in their new <MONEY>$600,000</MONEY> 
armored limousine for today's inaugural march, they'll travel a 
much-transformed <LOCATION>Pennsylvania Avenue</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
As they near the parade's end and turn toward the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>, they'll view the 
crown jewel of the avenue's <MONEY>$1.5-billion</MONEY> renovation, the <ORGANIZATION>Willard Hotel</ORGANIZATION>, the 
once vacant Beaux-Arts hotel that was restored to its original opulence and 
reopened in <DATE>1986</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel and a host of other buildings and parks are among the major new 
sights that have swept <LOCATION>Pennsylvania Avenue</LOCATION> since <DATE>1961</DATE>, when President <PERSON>John F. 
Kennedy</PERSON> rode the boulevard for his inaugural and saw a historic street so 
battered, filthy and dreary that he demanded that it be rebuilt to an image 
befitting <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
It has taken almost 30 years, more than <MONEY>$1.5 billion</MONEY> and the efforts of a 
public agency working with private developers to fulfill <LOCATION>Kennedy</LOCATION>'s demand. 
</P>
<P>
But now, gone are the shuttered shops, saloons and cheap hotels. New parks and 
lights, as well as restorations of historic buildings, have given <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> 
Avenue a clean, expensive look on the inaugural parade route. When the Bushes 
set out today on that path, stretching from the <LOCATION>Capitol</LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>, to 
their right will be the newly completed <PERSON>Meade Plaza</PERSON>, featuring the relocated 
18-foot marble monument to Civil War Maj. Gen. <PERSON>George Gordon Meade</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
To their left will be the dramatic, angular East Building of the <ORGANIZATION>National 
Gallery of Art</ORGANIZATION>, designed by architect <PERSON>I. M. Pei</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
The parade will continue past the <ORGANIZATION>Andrew Mellon Memorial Fountain</ORGANIZATION>, whose 
54-foot wide bronze basin is the largest ever cast in the world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cages of <ORGANIZATION>Canaries 
</P>
<P>
The Bushes</ORGANIZATION> will zip by <PERSON>John Marshall Park</PERSON>, one of five new park plazas 
completed since the last parade. The park connects the avenue to <LOCATION>Judiciary 
Square</LOCATION>, where cages of yellow canaries lined the walls of <PERSON>Ulysses S. Grant</PERSON>'s 
<DATE>1873</DATE> inaugural ball. 
</P>
<P>
Next to <ORGANIZATION>Marshall Park</ORGANIZATION>'s stair-stepped garden and fountains is the gleaming, new 
<ORGANIZATION>Postmodern Canadian Embassy</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Moving up past 6th Street, the Bushes will ride past two elaborately 
refurbished office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Next they will see <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s most laughed-at monument. The <ORGANIZATION>Temperance 
Fountain</ORGANIZATION>, featuring entwined dolphins beneath a water crane, symbolizes the 
superiority of water over demon rum. It was donated to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> by <LOCATION>San 
Francisco</LOCATION> dentist <PERSON>Henry Cogswell</PERSON> in the <DATE>1800s</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Moving along, the Bushes will pass the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Trade Commission</ORGANIZATION> and another new 
park, <ORGANIZATION>Market Square Park Navy Memorial</ORGANIZATION>. The park features a 100-foot-wide disk 
inlaid with a map of the world, fountains and a 7-foot statue titled, "Lone 
Sailor." Military bands give concerts there in the <DATE>summer</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Houses <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Constitution 
</P>
<P>
Across the street, on the south side, will be the sprawling <ORGANIZATION>National Archives</ORGANIZATION>, 
designed by <PERSON>John Russell Pope</PERSON>, architect of the <ORGANIZATION>Jefferson Memorial</ORGANIZATION>. Built in 
the <DATE>1930s</DATE>, its 75-foot-high exhibit hall houses the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Constitution, the 
Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
As much as those documents are a part of American history, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania Avenue</LOCATION> 
has been a key, colorful byway of the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
City planner <PERSON>Pierre L'Enfant</PERSON> -- hired by <PERSON>George Washington</PERSON> to plot a capital in 
the 10 square miles ceded from <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> -- envisioned <LOCATION>Pennsylvania 
Avenue</LOCATION> as a sparkling boulevard of foreign embassies with unobstructed, 
breath-taking views between the Capitol at one end and the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>, 14 
blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
But the avenue evolved differently. During the Civil War, a section of 
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> Avenue at 14th Street became the city's red-light district. The 
man selected to care for this area was Gen. <PERSON>Joseph Hooker</PERSON>, who distinguished 
himself to such an extent that ladies of the night became known as hookers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commissions Appointed 
</P>
<P>
By the <DATE>1930s</DATE>, the shops and boarding houses began to make way for a wall of 
Neoclassical office buildings. In the <DATE>1960s</DATE>, the avenue was a hodgepodge of 
drab office buildings and run-down stores. 
</P>
<P>
Presidents <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON>, <PERSON>Lyndon B. Johnson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Richard M. Nixon</PERSON> appointed a series 
of commissions to address the problem. 
</P>
<P>
But a turning point did not come until <DATE>1972</DATE>, when <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> established the 
<ORGANIZATION>Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to supervise the refurbishing of the 
avenue in tandem with the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the agency's major plans have come to fruition since the last inaugural 
parade in <DATE>1981</DATE>. (<PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON>'s <DATE>1985</DATE> parade was canceled because of bitter 
cold weather.) Many feel the street has never looked better. 
</P>
<P>
But amid the beauty of the boulevard, there is also a lingering sadness. On a 
normal day, the homeless roam up and down the street. One man has set up a 
permanent residence of sorts, a configuration of plastic and cardboard, right 
in front of the Old Executive Office Building, next door to the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>. 
His scrawled sign proclaims him to be a war veteran. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Homeless to Be Removed 
</P>
<P>
On parade day, the homeless will be removed from the avenue, though police have 
refused to discuss their plans for how this will be done. 
</P>
<P>
The Bushes, on the inaugural march, will pass between the <PERSON>J. Edgar Hoover</PERSON> FBI 
Building on their right and the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Justice</ORGANIZATION> on their left. The chunky 
FBI Building may not be pretty but it's one of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s most intriguing 
tourist attractions, especially the display of the "10 Most Wanted" criminals 
list. 
</P>
<P>
To spruce up the sprawling <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> building's <LOCATION>Pennsylvania Avenue</LOCATION> facade, the 
development agency is installing panels with eight life-sized figures of <LOCATION>George 
Washington</LOCATION>, <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON>, <PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON>, <PERSON>James Madison</PERSON>, <PERSON>James Monroe</PERSON>, <PERSON>Abraham 
Lincoln</PERSON>, <PERSON>Theodore Roosevelt</PERSON> and <PERSON>Woodrow Wilson</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Another new office development, 1001 <LOCATION>Pennsylvania Ave.</LOCATION>, will pop into view 
next. The 785,000-square foot facility includes a central atrium and 
incorporates a number of old architectural facades. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Saved from Wrecking Ball 
</P>
<P>
On the left is a building that dominates this area of the avenue, the 
Romanesque-style Old Post Office Building, whose soaring observation tower 
brought it the nickname "Old Tooth" and made it the tallest building in 
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. Preservation groups had to fight to save it from the wrecking ball 
before an enormous restoration effort turned the building into a shopping 
gallery and 10-story office complex. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street from the Old Post Office is the Evening Star Building, built 
in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s Beaux-Arts style to house the afternoon newspaper. Its finely 
detailed white marble facade is being spruced up as part of a rehabilitation 
project that eventually will contain 212,000 square feet of office and retail 
space. 
</P>
<P>
Another new office complex appears next, across from the massive Federal 
Triangle office building complex. The Bushes then pass yet another park, 
renamed Freedom Plaza in <DATE>1988</DATE> in honor of <ORGANIZATION>Dr. Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. A block 
long, Freedom Plaza is one of the major public spaces on the avenue and is the 
first of three parks spanning the next three blocks. 
</P>
<P>
Just beyond Freedom Plaza, the Bushes can see a brand-new shopping, hotel and 
office complex, and the restored <ORGANIZATION>National Theater</ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s oldest theater, 
it first opened in <DATE>1835</DATE> and reopened in <DATE>1984</DATE> after a major face lift. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lincoln Held Meetings 
</P>
<P>
The next block contains Pershing Park and just beyond it, the dazzling, 
renovated <ORGANIZATION>Willard Hotel and Office Building</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln held occasional staff meetings in the Willard lobby. <PERSON>Franklin Pierce</PERSON>, 
<PERSON>Calvin Coolidge</PERSON> and <PERSON>Harry S. Truman</PERSON> all stayed in the hotel, where King wrote 
his "I Have a Dream" speech and where guest <PERSON>Julia Ward Howe</PERSON> wrote the words to 
the "Battle Hymn of the Republic" on hotel stationery. 
</P>
<P>
Howe might have written another battle hymn if she could have looked into a 
crystal ball and seen the coming of the <DATE>1989</DATE> inaugural prices. The Presidential 
Suite, which has been rented out this week and includes a separate dining room, 
a grand piano, four-poster king size bed and a spa, goes for <MONEY>$2,300</MONEY> a night. 
</P>
<P>
The parade route then makes a right turn where <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> is rerouted to jut 
around the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>, passing the giant Treasury Building and <PERSON>Garfinckel</PERSON>'s 
<ORGANIZATION>Department Store</ORGANIZATION> before taking a left back onto <LOCATION>Pennsylvania Avenue</LOCATION>, now in 
front of the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street will be <LOCATION>Lafayette Square</LOCATION>, a large park that has become the 
parking spot for protest groups a lunch spot for office workers and home to 
many homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The parade ends just past the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>, and the Bushes then can move into 
their new home.

   International Business Machines Corp., which for years
resisted the nickname "Big Blue," is now fighting for
exclusive use of the moniker against a little company that
claims the name for itself.
   The smaller company, six-person computer and software
distributor Big Blue Products Inc., won the first round of
the battle recently when the federal Trademark Trial and
Appeal Board refused to cede the title to IBM. The board is a
branch of the federal Patent and Trademark Office.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The board said an administrative trial would be needed to
determine whether the public or the trade had come to
associate the nickname with <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>'s typewriter ribbons or other
products. If not, <ORGANIZATION>Big Blue Products</ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION>Northport</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>,
apparently would be allowed to keep its name.
   The dispute centers around <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>1989</DATE> application to
register Big Blue as a trademark for a new line of typewriter
ribbons. Big Blue Products opposed the registration,
contending that it had used the trademark since <DATE>1984</DATE>,
although it had not registered the name. The Patent and
<ORGANIZATION>Trademark Office</ORGANIZATION> has not yet agreed to register the name to
either company.
   <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> maintains in its court papers that it has the superior
claim to the name, because "since the <DATE>1960s</DATE> the nickname BIG
BLUE has been used publicly by the trade, by the news media
and by the general public to identify <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>." To support its
claim, <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> submitted more than 500 newspaper and magazine
articles where the term "Big Blue" was used in association
with the computer giant.
   Big Blue Products argued that the articles failed to show
that the public identifies the nickname with <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>. It also
pointed out that <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> had for many years objected to the
reference, considering it a derisive reference to the
company's size and power. The nickname apparently referred
originally to the color of <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>'s large mainframe computers.
   In its opinion early this month, the board said it
recognized that a company may have a protectable right in the
use of a nickname, even though it hasn't capitalized on it.
But it noted that "the use by the public of a term to refer
to a company and/or its products or services does not mean
that the company has obtained rights to exclude others from
using the same term for any product or service, and it
certainly does not mean that the company has obtained rights
to register the term as a mark for any product or service."
   About two years ago, the computer giant began a campaign
to protect the name by pursuing legal action against
imitators, while trying to register Big Blue with the <ORGANIZATION>Patent
and Trademark Office</ORGANIZATION>. After talks with two companies -- a <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION> winery and a <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> computer company -- <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> agreed to
leave them alone, as long as there was no confusion about
which company marketed the products, an <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said.
   Patent lawyers say the nickname doctrine recognizes that a
company has a protected right in a nickname, even though it
has done nothing to promote the name. What is key is that the
public associates the name with a particular company and that
confusion would arise if another company uses the same name,
they say.
   <PERSON>Roger Schechter</PERSON>, a trademark professor at <ORGANIZATION>George
Washington University</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>National Law Center</ORGANIZATION>, says that over
the years companies have won the right to protect nicknames
like <ORGANIZATION>Coke</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola Co.</ORGANIZATION>), Bud (Budweiser), Met (Metropolitan
Opera), HOJO (<PERSON>Howard Johnson</PERSON>), HOG (<ORGANIZATION>Harley Davidson Inc.</ORGANIZATION>) and
Bug (<ORGANIZATION>Volkswagen AG</ORGANIZATION>). "Can you market a brand of french fries
called Golden Arches?" <PERSON>Mr. Schechter</PERSON> asked rhetorically.

   <ORGANIZATION>MERRILL LYNCH</ORGANIZATION> sues three former employees over alleged
bribery scheme.
   In the suit, <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION> accused two former vice
presidents, a former construction manager and several
construction contractors of a kickback scheme involving the
construction of the company's headquarters at <ORGANIZATION>World Financial
Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>.
   The two former vice presidents, <PERSON>Albert Young</PERSON> and <PERSON>John
Serino</PERSON>, pleaded guilty in <DATE>November</DATE> to criminal charges in
connection with the alleged scheme.
   In the suit, filed in federal court in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Merrill
Lynch</ORGANIZATION> said that its in-house investigation is continuing, and
that it may add other defendants to the suit.
   The suit accuses <PERSON>Messrs. Young</PERSON>, <PERSON>Serino</PERSON> and <PERSON>Robert Fraser</PERSON>,
the construction manager, of receiving hundreds of thousands
of dollars in illegal bribes and kickbacks from the
contractors and suppliers. In return, <PERSON>Messrs. Young</PERSON>, <PERSON>Serino</PERSON>
and <PERSON>Fraser</PERSON> are accused of arranging for the companies to get
work on the project.
   <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION> said the alleged scheme resulted in the
company's paying inflated prices for the construction. The
company said in the suit that the scheme began in <DATE>1985</DATE> and
involved cash bribes handed over secretly in bathrooms and
stairways. The suit also alleged that <PERSON>Mr. Young</PERSON> used a secret
Bahamian bank account to funnel some of the payments he
received.
   The suit seeks unspecified total damages, including the
return of all compensation paid to <PERSON>Messrs. Young</PERSON>, <PERSON>Serino</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Fraser</PERSON> during the alleged scheme.
   Attorneys for <PERSON>Messrs. Young</PERSON>, <PERSON>Serino</PERSON> and <PERSON>Fraser</PERSON> couldn't be
reached for comment.

   LEBOEUF LAMB opens office in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> despite turmoil in
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.
   LeBoeuf, <ORGANIZATION>Lamb</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Leiby &amp; McRae</ORGANIZATION>, a 425-lawyer firm based in
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, has set up a <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> office headed by <PERSON>James I.
Mandel</PERSON>. At least five other <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> law firms have <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>
operations.
   <PERSON>John I. Huhs</PERSON>, New York-based head of LeBoeuf's Soviet and
Eastern European practice group, said the firm is making a
capital investment in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> because Western companies
continue to want to participate in Soviet joint ventures,
despite economic and political turmoil.
   He said companies the firm represents are "getting their
feet wet" with modest investments of <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$10
million</MONEY> in such wide-ranging enterprises as a consumer-goods
factory, a brick-manufacturing plant and a sound-recording
studio.

   BASEBALL STAR <PERSON>Joe Morgan</PERSON>'s award against <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>
police upheld.
   A federal judge approved a <MONEY>$540,000</MONEY> jury award to baseball
<PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of Famer <PERSON>Joe Morgan</PERSON>, who sued the department after a
policeman allegedly roughed him up three years ago at the <LOCATION>Los
Angeles International Airport</LOCATION>. The award, reached at the end
of a trial <DATE>last February</DATE>, included <MONEY>$450,000</MONEY> in punitive
damages against the officer.
   <PERSON>Mr. Morgan</PERSON> said he was waiting for a connecting flight
when he was grabbed, thrown to the ground and handcuffed by
officers who claimed he resembled a suspected drug courier's
companion. In his suit the former player claimed that his
civil rights were violated and that officers harassed him
primarily because he is black.
   The ruling by <PERSON>Judge Mariana Pfaelzer</PERSON> comes at a time of
controversy about police brutality in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> in the
aftermath of the videotaped beating of motorist <PERSON>Rodney King</PERSON>
last month. On <DATE>Friday</DATE> a <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Superior Court</ORGANIZATION> jury
awarded about <MONEY>$8.8 million</MONEY> in damages to another man, wounded
in <DATE>1987</DATE> by an off-duty police officer. That award is believed
to be the highest police-related damage assessment in city
history.
   An attorney for the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Police Department</ORGANIZATION> said it
will appeal.

   Ally Milder needs all the help she can get for
her campaign to unseat <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> Democratic congressman <PERSON>Peter
Hoagland</PERSON>. But she has no intention of asking Veterans Affairs
Secretary <PERSON>Edward Derwinski</PERSON> for a return visit to <LOCATION>Omaha</LOCATION>.
   The former <ORGANIZATION>Illinois</ORGANIZATION> congressman said <DATE>Monday</DATE> that Milder's
concern was ``understandable'' in the aftermath of his reference to
illegal aliens as ``wetbacks,'' a remark he conceded was ``a dumb
mistake.''
   ``There's no place in government for people who have attitudes
like this,'' said <PERSON>Milder</PERSON>, who said it was up to President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to
decide whether the remark was enough to force the Cabinet secretary
to resign.
   ``We're not going to comment,'' said <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> spokesman
<PERSON>Marlin Fitzwater</PERSON>.
   Milder wouldn't discuss the incident which occurred <DATE>Friday</DATE>
<TIME>morning</TIME> and stirred an unwanted controversy over the weekend.
   ``That's certainly not the way she feels in the least sense of
the word,'' said <PERSON>Kent Grisham</PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Nebraska
Republican Party</ORGANIZATION>. ``I think she made an interesting point that
being Jewish she has experienced a lot of prejudice first-hand.''
   <PERSON>Riccardo Correa</PERSON>, an <LOCATION>Omaha</LOCATION> businessman who is active in Hispanic
affairs, said <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON>'s remark had not altered his long-standing
support for Milder.
   <PERSON>Correa</PERSON> said her apology was ``not for people like me but for
people who would use this against her.''
   Hoagland won the <LOCATION>Omaha</LOCATION> congressional seat in <DATE>1988</DATE> by a margin of
fewer than 3,000 votes, succeeding Republican <PERSON>Hal Daub</PERSON> who ran for
the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Howard Schloss</PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>House Democratic</ORGANIZATION> campaign
committee, called the Hoagland-Milder contest ``a very tight race''
and he relished the opportunity to link Milder to <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON>.
   ``It showed very bad judgment on her part to even invite him out
there in the first place,'' he said. Calling <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON>
``insensitive not only to minorities but to women,'' <PERSON>Schloss</PERSON> said
<PERSON>Milder</PERSON> ``brought him out there regardless of his views on these
matters.''
   Derwinski aides confirmed published reports that the Cabinet
secretary often refers to women on his staff by nicknames such as
``Little Miss Coffee Maker,'' ``<PERSON>Zsa Zsa</PERSON>,'' ``Little Miss Muffett''
and ``<PERSON>Lena</PERSON>.'' He also has nicknames for several male aides.
   <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> said the nicknames were part of his policy of running
``a completely informal office.''
   He called it ``just one of my efforts to have one great big
happy family on my staff.''
   Derwinski aides refer to him as ``The Big Cheese.''
   <PERSON>Sandy Peyton</PERSON>, a program assistant at the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Veterans
Affairs</ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> calls her ``Miss America,'' and ``I don't
mind at all being called that.''
   <PERSON>Peyton</PERSON> said there was ``a good warm atmosphere'' in the office
and that the women employees ``were all livid'' to read a story
suggesting they were offended by the secretary's habit of giving
them nicknames.
   <PERSON>Derwinski</PERSON> said his use of the term ``wetback'' was ``just one of
those dumb slips ... that law of averages you have them, I guess.''
   He said he used the term during a breakfast meeting when he was
asked what his department was doing to combat drugs.
   ``I just volunteered that one of the problems with drugs is
they're so easy to smuggle and that therefore curing addiction in
the long run was the way we had to go,'' he recalled. ``And then I
just got so carried away with my subject that without even thinking
of exactly what I said, I said the drug cartel even uses wetbacks
to get drugs into the country.''
   He said he hadn't realized what he said and ``the first
opportunity I apologized ... I said, obviously, it was a dumb
mistake. ... It was an inadvertent, almost unconscious comment.''

<HEAD>`Brownie' Agents Will Get the Blues</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   ``Ephemeral, clean'' blue will signal the brash
new fashion statement of traffic agents, long saddled with the
nickname ``Brownies'' because of their oh-so-drab uniforms.
   ``<PERSON>Brown</PERSON> looks dirty; it seems to remind you of congestion,'' said
<PERSON>Joe DePlasco</PERSON>, spokesman for the city <ORGANIZATION>Department of Transportation</ORGANIZATION>.
   And so on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, at ceremonies marking the 30th anniversary of
the traffic enforcement division, the department will reveal all _
via mannequins adorned with uniforms past, present and future.
   Much has changed since <DATE>June 1, 1960</DATE>, when the city sent forth its
first corps of so-called ``meter maids.''
   That all-woman ticket-writing force wore white blouses, navy blue
skirts and scarves, black kid pumps and a hat modeled after that
worn by the era's airline stewardesses. A men's version was created
when the force went co-ed in <DATE>1967</DATE>.
   In <DATE>1974</DATE>, the duds du jour became a brown skirt or pants; brown
jacket and overcoat; brown shoes; brown tie and white shirt.
   You might say that brown became all the rage after that. In
recent years, the color has become to some belligerent motorists
what red is to a bull.
   ``There is a lot of Brownie bashing that is going on in the
streets,'' said <PERSON>DePlasco</PERSON>. ``We'd like to change the image that
traffic agents can be abused by the public.''
   In the <DATE>first four months of 1990</DATE>, 167 traffic agents were
assaulted or otherwise confronted by unruly motorists; in the same
period last year, the number was 114.
   Besides, says <PERSON>DePlasco</PERSON>, the Brownies _ er, traffic enforcement
agents _ found their nickname to be pejorative. They hope the new
garb will signal a new era of respect.
   ``We think the uniform could give a greater sense of pride, would
be cleaner, look nicer, make the person feel happier about
themselves and win more respect from the public,'' said <PERSON>DePlasco</PERSON>.
   The city's 1,900 traffic agents will phase in the new look, using
their <MONEY>$480</MONEY> a year uniform allowance.
   It will feature a navy blue hat, white shirt, navy blue tie, navy
blue jacket, gray trousers with a navy stripe and black shoes. A
committee is being formed to add the finishing touches, and the
final creation is expected by fall.
   ``We're willing to take suggestions from renowned <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>
fashion designers,'' said <PERSON>DePlasco</PERSON>.

A <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> commander, engaging in unusually frank public criticism, said the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
warship <LOCATION>Vincennes</LOCATION> that shot down an Iranian airliner, killing 290 people, had 
been given the derogatory nickname "Robo Cruiser" for its aggressive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Cmdr. <PERSON>David R. Carlson</PERSON> of the frigate Sides, which was in the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> at 
the time of the <DATE>July 3, 1988</DATE>, downing, wrote in the <DATE>September</DATE> issue of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. 
Naval Institute</ORGANIZATION> magazine Proceedings that the aggressiveness of the <LOCATION>Vincennes</LOCATION>, 
commanded by Capt. <PERSON>Will Rogers III</PERSON>, was well known among naval officers in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
"Having watched the performance of the <LOCATION>Vincennes</LOCATION> for a month before the 
incident, my impression was clearly that an atmosphere of restraint was not her 
long suit," <PERSON>Carlson</PERSON> wrote. "Her actions appeared to be consistently aggressive 
and had become a topic of wardroom conversation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Unamusing Nickname' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Robo Cruiser' was the unamusing nickname that someone jokingly came up with 
for her, and it stuck," <PERSON>Carlson</PERSON> wrote. "My guess was that the crew of the 
<LOCATION>Vincennes</LOCATION> felt a need to prove the viability of Aegis (the sophisticated 
anti-aircraft system on the cruiser) in the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> and that they hankered 
for the opportunity to show their stuff." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Carlson</PERSON> wrote that the <LOCATION>Vincennes</LOCATION> started a sea battle with Iranian gunboats 
earlier in the day in response to what may have been nothing more than warning 
shots from the boats feeling threatened by the cruiser's helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
When the Iranian airliner came along later, the crew of the <LOCATION>Vincennes</LOCATION> 
misidentified the plane as an Iranian F-14 fighter jet and shot it down, though 
the Sides' radar showed the craft to be climbing and to be "a non-threat." 
</P>
<P>
"The <LOCATION>Vincennes</LOCATION> announced her intentions to take TN 4131 (Track No. 4131, the 
Iranian airliner) with missiles at 20 miles. I wondered aloud in disbelief, but 
I did not do the one thing that might have helped. I did not think to push for 
a reevaluation of <ORGANIZATION>IFF</ORGANIZATION> (identification of friend or foe)," <PERSON>Carlson</PERSON> wrote.

   <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>'s education commissioner is
urging schools to drop Indian nicknames, but an Indian leader says
that's not necessarily a good idea.
   ``If your school district has an Indian mascot, emblem or symbol,
please report your progress toward removing them,'' Commissioner
<PERSON>Ruth Randall</PERSON> and state <ORGANIZATION>Board of Education</ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON>Marjorie Johnson</PERSON>
said in a letter this week.
   They called the names ``offensive to persons of American Indian
culture'' and reminded districts of a board resolution adopted last
year encouraging removal of Indian mascots.
   But Chip <LOCATION>Wadena</LOCATION>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Minnesota Chippewa Tribe</ORGANIZATION> and
the White Earth Indian Reservation, criticized the board for not
consulting tribal officials.
   <LOCATION>Wadena</LOCATION> and other Indian leaders said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that they want the
right to keep such mascots when the schools' students are
predominantly American Indian. They also said that Indian themes are
not a problem if handled with respect.
   <LOCATION>Wadena</LOCATION> said the <LOCATION>White Earth</LOCATION> tribal council is supporting the
<ORGANIZATION>Mahnomen School District</ORGANIZATION>, which is within the reservation, in
retaining its ``Indians'' nickname. About <PERCENT>38 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Mahnomen
High School</ORGANIZATION> students are Indian.
   But <PERSON>Phil St. John</PERSON>, a member of Concerned American Indian Parents
who has led a campaign against using Indian names as mascots, said
such names are derogatory and portray Indians in ``an animalistic,
warlike image.''
   Last month, the <ORGANIZATION>Minnesota Civil Liberties Union</ORGANIZATION> threatened to sue
50 public schools for civil rights violations if they don't change
their Indian mascots.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Pangs of delight for Hong Kong cartoonists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A hairdresser recently asked her view of <PERSON>Mr Chris Patten</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>'s new
governor, furrowed her brow and said: 'Hmmm, <PERSON>Mr Patten</PERSON>; a very important
man.'
'Why?' 'Well, he's the chairman of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> is lucky to have such
an important man.'
The former chairman of the Conservative party might be taken aback by his
elevation, but then, to the Chinese, the word 'chairman' has a singular ring
to it.
An altogether different grassroots perception of the new governor is
provided by cartoonists in the leading local newspapers. They have lighted
on <PERSON>Mr Patten</PERSON>'s somewhat corpulent demeanour and nicknamed him 'Fat <PERSON>Pang</PERSON>' -
<PERSON>Pang</PERSON> being the Chinese surname he has taken.
This is not a case of lese majeste as such - the Chinese will pick on
someone's most distinguishing feature be it a stammer, squint or limp and
turn it into a nickname - but more a piece of well-intentioned and
irreverent teasing.
But it is a nickname the governor will have to live with for the rest of his
time in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>. One newspaper, the <ORGANIZATION>Hong Kong Economic Journal</ORGANIZATION>, has begun
to run a daily comic strip entitled 'Fat <ORGANIZATION>Pang</ORGANIZATION>'s Theatre'.
<PERSON>Mr Patten</PERSON>'s desire to run an 'open and accessible' administration - one
element of which will be a form of prime minister's questions in the local
legislature - will no doubt provide fertile material for the colony's local
wags.
So may his desire to run a 'presidential' style of government. Yesterday, he
held one of the largest press conferences the colony has seen in the garden
of his official residence. It was not quite the <ORGANIZATION>White House Rose Garden</ORGANIZATION>, but
the tone was unmistakable. <PERSON>Mr Patten</PERSON> intends to lead from the front.

   There is substantial evidence to indicate that your
labeling of Martin Van Buren as "a member of the Northeastern
Establishment" was erroneous ("Martin Van Bush," Review &amp;
Outlook, Nov. 7). No less an authority on the administration
of Jackson and Van Buren than a member of your own editorial
Board of Contributors, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., has shed
much light on this matter. In his book "The Age of Jackson"
Mr. Schlesinger devotes more space in the index to Martin Van
Buren than to any other person mentioned in the book except
Jackson.
   If there is one main theme that characterizes the
Establishment it is the close relationship between government
and banking, money creation, borrowing, lending, interest
rates and legal-tender laws. If there is another, it would be
the Establishment's advocacy of government aid to private
corporations. In his index, Mr. Schlesinger refers the reader
to Van Buren's positions on numerous issues by page number.
For example: "opposes government aid to private corporations,
58" and "supports hard money, 115, 126." These two positions
alone place Van Buren well outside the camp of the
"Northeastern Establishment."

<TEXT>
   Van <PERSON>Buren</PERSON> was born in <LOCATION>Kinderhook</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, and was given the
nickname "Old Kinderhook." From that nickname came the
expression "OK," the initials Van Buren scrawled on
documents. It has become the most universal word in any
language meaning approval. <ORGANIZATION>Martin Van Buren</ORGANIZATION> was indeed OK.

I enjoy the writings of <PERSON>Mike Downey</PERSON> and often find his work very humorous. 
</P>
<P>
On <DATE>Monday</DATE>, I was deeply moved by <PERSON>Mike</PERSON>'s piece and found it difficult to finish 
reading it. 
</P>
<P>
My younger brother, <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>, a student at <ORGANIZATION>Santa Clara University</ORGANIZATION>, was so amazed by 
<PERSON>Hank Gathers</PERSON>' performances that he nicknamed him "F-Gathers," as in an F-4 
fighter jet. I used to like that nickname, but we'll use it no more. Our 
fighter has been shot down. 
</P>
<P>
We will all miss <PERSON>Hank</PERSON> the basketball player, but mostly we will miss <PERSON>Hank</PERSON> the 
person.

   What flagrant exhibitionism, what terrible
identity crisis, what suicidal yearnings would compel a middle-aged
man to wriggle into a woman's dress and brave the taunts of 56,000
howling fans at a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Redskins football game?
   <PERSON>Michael Torbert</PERSON> stood thoughtfully at his front-row seat at the
50-yard line at <LOCATION>RFK Stadium</LOCATION>. He fluffed his bright yellow tresses,
smoothed the wrinkles from his polka-dot skirt and sniffed through
his plastic hog snout.
   ``Hey, priests have been wearing dresses for years, right?'' he
said. ``We just add a little color.''
   <PERSON>Torbert</PERSON> and his pot-bellied buddies are familiar to millions of
TV football viewers as the ``Hogettes,'' the unofficial Redskins
cheerleaders who go hog-wild every <DATE>Sunday</DATE> afternoon in gaudy wigs
and skirts, floppy hats and pink snouts.
   ``Our designer is <PERSON>Calvin Swine</PERSON>,'' says <PERSON>Ralph Campbell</PERSON>, who wears
a bleached-blonde wig and ruffled yellow dress with red Hogette
sash across his ample waist. A retired <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> helicopter mechanic,
he's known as ``the pretty one.''
   These bearded bimbos have nicknames like ``Pork Chop'' and ``Big
Georgette'' and ``Peewee.'' They boast an average weight of 243
pounds, nurtured by plenty of hot dogs and beer. They like to chew
on huge plastic cigars.
   And when the Redskins are rolling toward a touchdown, they wave
their parasols and hoist their beefy legs over the railing,
bellowing encouragement.
   Torbert organized the Hogettes in <DATE>1983</DATE> to lead cheers for the
``Hogs,'' the nickname of the Redskins' offensive linemen, and to
raise money for their favorite children's charities.
   The Hogettes range in age and occupation from a 28-year-old mail
carrier to a 59-year-old retired civilian employee of <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>
intelligence. Torbert, 45, an <ORGANIZATION>Energy Department</ORGANIZATION> engineer and
longtime Redskins fan, said all the Hogettes are devoted fathers
and civic activists.
   Since <DATE>1983</DATE>, he said, the Hogettes have helped raise <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY>
for sick and underprivileged children by appearing at golf
tournaments, telethons, parades and other charity benefits at their
own expense.
   Each of the 11 regular Hogettes spends as much as <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> out of
pocket to attend Redskins games and log about 5,000 miles traveling
to more than 100 fund-raising events every year, <PERSON>Torbert</PERSON> estimated.
   Their 17 beneficiaries include Children's Hospital in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Ronald McDonald House</ORGANIZATION> and a rural <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> <DATE>summer</DATE>
camp for young cancer patients.
   ``I didn't have a dress in my closet for the first 40 years,''
said <PERSON>George Maxfield</PERSON>, alias ``Big Georgette.''
   ``My mom didn't raise me that way. But I'd do anything to raise
money for these kids,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Campbell</PERSON>, who's nickname is ``Grandpa,'' says he has no qualms
about looking foolish in a woman's skirt, ``if it brings smiles to
the kids' faces and makes some money for the sick ones.''
   The Hogettes have stolen dresses from their mothers' closets and
learned how to drink beer without getting their hog snouts wet.
   They've been pelted with ice and game programs. They've had
their snouts pulled back and snapped in their faces. Shouts of
``You're mighty cute!'' and ``What are you doing after the game?''
are commonplace.
   They take personal bodyguards when they travel to <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>
to protect them against violence. ``We know how the Israelis feel
when we attend an <ORGANIZATION>Eagles</ORGANIZATION> game - four of us surrounded by an armed
camp,'' <PERSON>Torbert</PERSON> said.
   The Hogettes have endured not only icy stadium winds but more
than a few surprise pinches on their tushes from playful fans.
   Maxfield, who stands 6-feet-4, remembers a particularly painful
grab at the <PERSON>Hogettes</PERSON>' first Super Bowl at <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, in <DATE>January
1984</DATE>.
   ``I was going up into the stands for lunch when somebody hogged
down on my right cheek big-time,'' he said. ``I swung around, and
it was a woman who must have been at least 7 feet tall.
   ``She said, `I'm sorry, I just couldn't resist.' I said, `If it
turns you on, feel free.' So darned if she didn't do it again -
real hard - and I almost went to the emergency room to see if she'd
torn a chunk out of me.''

<LEADPARA>  American Indian groups seeking to change the nickname of the Atlanta Braves
said Tuesday that once the World Series is over, they will turn their
attention to the NFL's Washington Redskins.;   "They're next," said Roger
Head, an Ojibway Indian who works with the Minneapolis-based Indian Affairs
Council. "Their fans are the ones that wear the headdresses, the paint, the

<MEMO>  World Series  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     <PERSON>Clyde Bellecourt</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>American Indian Movement</ORGANIZATION>, said there
would be protests outside <LOCATION>RFK</LOCATION> Stadium in an effort to get the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> club to
change its name.;   "It's a bad part of this whole stereotype of Native
Americans," said <PERSON>Bellecourt</PERSON>, who has led protests outside the Metrodome in
<LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION> to protest the <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> team's nickname and Braves fans' habit of
waving imaginary tomahawks. "Indians are people, and we don't want to be
mascots anymore for <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s fun and games.";   Head said: "Generally, we do
the lobbying, and others, like A.I.M., do the protesting. We will work
together.";   The Redskins have rebuffed similar protests in the past, most
recently in <DATE>1988</DATE>, when the <ORGANIZATION>Congress of American Indians</ORGANIZATION> complained that the
team's nickname was offensive.;   Although the term "Redskin" is considered by
many Native Americans to be pejorative, officials with the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> team insist
that the team's insignia -- featuring an American Indian dressed in battle
headgear and war paint -- stresses the proud, strong heritage.  </TEXT>

   ``Lardy'' and ``Jughead'' know one of the
first rules of rural politics in <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>: Don't get too uppity
with the folks that put you in office.
   They are among more than 200 candidates in primary elections
today who have chosen to put their nicknames on the ballot.
   A name with quotation marks in it is the great equalizer, said
Flatwoods Mayor <PERSON>T.L.</PERSON> ``Lardy'' Groves, 71, who is running for
<LOCATION>Greenup County</LOCATION> judge-executive.
   ``Anytime you got (a nickname), it brings you down on the same

``They say, `He's not one o' them big shots.'''
   Besides, almost nobody knows him by his real name. Since Groves'
playmates named him ``Lardy'' at a swimming hole more than 60 years
ago _ ``I was a little, round boy,'' he said _ the label has stuck.
   Earl ``Jughead'' <PERSON>Mastin</PERSON>, 61, was born in <LOCATION>Sardis</LOCATION>, ``a little ol'

   <PERSON>Mastin</PERSON> said his nickname comes from when he weighed less than

Connors was once a terrific 25-year-old tennis player who acted like a
12-year-old. Today, he's a terrific 39-year-old tennis player who acts like a
12-year-old. His tirades to the chair umpire <DATE>Monday</DATE> ("My butt! You're an

and embarrassing. <PERSON>Nolan Ryan</PERSON> and <PERSON>George Foreman</PERSON> set the standard for senior

be permitted to behave like baseball umpires when players start arguing. Be
honest, now. The next time <PERSON>Connors</PERSON> begins to harass a chair ump, wouldn't you
love to see the guy leap out of his seat and go face to face with <PERSON>Connors</PERSON> --
then thumb him from the stadium?;    TAKE THAT back about <ORGANIZATION>Artur Irbe</ORGANIZATION>. He
instead will be called the "Perestroika Puckstopper.";   (check) <PERSON>Steve Young</PERSON>
will not automatically receive most of the blame for every 49ers loss in <DATE>1991</DATE>.
All right, so I was guilty of this myself <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. Young was no <PERSON>Joe

either. And the 49ers' defense did miss a few tackles and/or assignments,
which contributed to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s winning drive.;   (check) Sportswriters who go
overboard in criticizing a nice guy like <PERSON>Steve Young</PERSON> will receive special
pardons for doing so -- although as punishment, they will be required to write
about synchronized swimming at least twice a year (I've written one already,
so I get credit for time served).;   (check) The baseball card market will
collapse when someone finally sits up, slaps his head and realizes, "Wait a

back again. Artur Irbe's new nickname will actually be the "Latvian Leather
Lunge-master.";   (check) Artificial turf will be banned in every football

and say the injury rate is no different than on natural grass. All I know is,
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s three major injuries to glamour players -- <PERSON>Randall Cunningham</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dave

   Fifty years ago in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Resurreccion Florendo</PERSON>'s parents had no trouble choosing her nickname. 
But today, their daughter faces big trouble because of their choice. 

   <PERSON>Mrs. Florendo</PERSON>'s nickname is <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>. 
She and her husband, <PERSON>Gerardo</PERSON>, own and operate a modest restaurant in downtown <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>, plus a couple of fast-food outlets and a catering service, all doing business as "<ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>'s." 

   That fact has upset another -- and somewhat larger -- business: <ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
To the Florendos' dismay, the electronics giant has sued them in the federal courthouse a few blocks from the restaurant, alleging trademark infringement, unfair competition and deliberate confusion of consumers. 
<ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> wants <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>'s to pay <MONEY>$300,000</MONEY> in damages. 

   "Kalokohan!" responds <PERSON>Mrs. Florendo</PERSON>, who immigrated to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> in <DATE>1968</DATE> and opened the restaurant in <DATE>1982</DATE>. 
"I was <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> Florendo before there was a <ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
What will happen to all the Resurrecciones, Asunciones and Corazones of my country who are nicknamed <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>?" 

   <ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s trademark arrived in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> in <DATE>1960</DATE>. 
The company makes a habit of defending it aggressively, having won infringement cases against smaller businesses that sell everything from chocolates to bicycles. 
An attorney for <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> says the company's name has become so popular here that it "needs to be protected to avoid confusion." 

   But the Florendos' patrons don't buy that argument. 
"When I'm eating there, I never think of the other <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>," says <PERSON>Karen Salisbury</PERSON>, a longtime customer of the restaurant. 
"There's no confusion." 

   Some loyal patrons are so aggravated that they have mounted a counter-attack by writing letters, boycotting <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> products and setting up a legal fund for the Florendos. 
"Our goal is to protect our little <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> and put a dent in the reputation of the big <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>," says <PERSON>Bayani Elma</PERSON>, a restaurant regular who heads the boycott. 

   For her part, <PERSON>Mrs. Florendo</PERSON> says she has tried to compromise, but without success. 
She says the company rejects her idea of renaming the restaurant "Sony Florendo's" and instead insists she promise that, after she dies, her survivors won't use the name. 

   "That's too much," she says. 
"I'm an immigrant in this country with no roots. 
All I brought with me was my dignity, my principles and my name. 
My parents gave me that, not <ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp.</ORGANIZATION>"

<HL> Here's a Solution: Kodak Could Just Change Its Name to Rakow </HL>
<AUTHOR> Clare Ansberry (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<CO> EK </CO>
<TEXT>
   It's not easy for comedians to make a decent living these days. 
What with the sagging stock market and the current crop of presidential candidates, no one is in much of a laughing mood. 
So why is <ORGANIZATION>Eastman Kodak Co.</ORGANIZATION> giving <PERSON>D.B. Rakow</PERSON> such a rough time? 

   Because the <LOCATION>Syracuse</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, comedian performs under a nickname he's had for nearly 20 years -- <ORGANIZATION>Kodak</ORGANIZATION>. 

   And the photographic-products giant sees little humor in that. 
Indeed, <ORGANIZATION>Kodak</ORGANIZATION> (the company) has taken <ORGANIZATION>Kodak</ORGANIZATION> (the comic) to court; later this month a federal judge in <LOCATION>Rochester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, is expected to hear arguments over who should get the last laugh. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Rakow</PERSON> -- already prevented by court order from uttering the K-word -- acquired the sobriquet in <DATE>1969</DATE>, while serving in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. 
He won't say how he earned it, nor will he talk about the case in general. 
But war stories circulating in western <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> suggest that either a small <ORGANIZATION>Kodak</ORGANIZATION> camera in his pocket deflected a bullet and saved his life, or that he took lots of pretend pictures with a <ORGANIZATION>Kodak</ORGANIZATION> camera. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Rakow</PERSON> has used the nickname professionally for eight years. 
It never posed a problem until last year when he appeared at a club in <LOCATION>Rochester</LOCATION> just down the street from <ORGANIZATION>Kodak</ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters. 
The club marquee read "Kodak," and the company apparently didn't want anyone confusing the two buildings. 
It complained to <PERSON>Mr. Rakow</PERSON> and says that he agreed in writing to stop using its name. 

   So when the comedian, still sporting his familiar moniker, appeared recently at another <LOCATION>Rochester</LOCATION> club, <ORGANIZATION>Kodak</ORGANIZATION> filed suit and won a temporary restraining order barring <PERSON>Mr. Rakow</PERSON> from using his nickname. 

   Company officials worry that if <PERSON>Mr. Rakow</PERSON> uses the company's valuable trade name, others will do the same -- and soon it will lose its cachet. 
"We don't want to become another thermos or cellophane," says a <ORGANIZATION>Kodak</ORGANIZATION> spokesman. 
Moreover, the company fears people will associate it with <PERSON>Mr. Rakow</PERSON>, whose act, according to the suit, is "off-color" and "crude." 

   <PERSON>Walter Munson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Rakow</PERSON>'s attorney, scoffs at this last notion. 
"There's no way he would be mistaken as a <ORGANIZATION>Kodak</ORGANIZATION> employee or representative," he says. 

   Still, the injunction against the comedian left <PERSON>Jeff Springut</PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION>Red Creek Inn</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Rochester</LOCATION>, not sure what to call <PERSON>Mr. Rakow</PERSON> during an appearance at the club last week. 
His solution: placing a sign in the club lobby that read, "Fuji or <ORGANIZATION>Polaroid</ORGANIZATION> or Something Like That."

Shame, shame: From Tom Powers of the <ORGANIZATION>St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch</ORGANIZATION>: "How dumb 
are the radio guys? When a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> radio station got word over the wires 
that <PERSON>Bo Jackson</PERSON> of the Royals had to leave a game early with a strained thigh 
muscle, its representative called the <LOCATION>K.C.</LOCATION> press box to ask if <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> would be 
able to return to the game later. Obviously a football-oriented station."

been fined more than once by Manager <PERSON>Bucky Dent</PERSON> for being late and not running 
out ground balls. 
</P>
<P>
Said <ORGANIZATION>Marty Noble of Newsday</ORGANIZATION>: "We've all seen storefronts with flawed neon signs 
-- you know, with a letter or two missing. Could it be that <PERSON>Neon Deion</PERSON> is 
suffering from that problem?" 
</P>
<P>
For all seasons: Headline in the <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> Plain Dealer after the <ORGANIZATION>Cavaliers</ORGANIZATION> 
drafted <PERSON>Seton Hall</PERSON> guard <PERSON>John Morton</PERSON>: "Cavaliers Think <PERSON>Morton</PERSON> Worth His Salt." 
</P>
<P>
Tunnel vision: The subject was concentration and <PERSON>Orel Hershiser</PERSON> told <PERSON>John 
McGrath</PERSON> of the Denver Post: "Last year during the seventh game of the <ORGANIZATION>National 
League</ORGANIZATION> playoffs, when I came out to pitch the top of the ninth, I got all 
caught up in the scene instead of the batter. I mean, there was a standing 
ovation for me and everything. So what'd I do? I threw the first pitch and hit 
the batter, <PERSON>Lee Mazzilli</PERSON>. That taught me a lesson. Always keep your game face

   Despite <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> claims, <LOCATION>New York

   ``Big Apple,'' says <PERSON>Koch</PERSON>, was musicians' slang that came from

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``A Bronx Tale,'' written and acted by <PERSON>Chazz
Palminteri</PERSON>, tells the story of a boy growing up with two father
figures, one of them a mobster.
   It's an interesting large anecdote, stuffed full of small,
fascinating, well-rounded anecdotes, containing both gritty
unpleasantness and light humor plus some moral points.
   The play, in which Palminteri takes a boy he calls Colognio from
age 9 through adolescence, opened <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> at Playhouse 91
off-Broadway.
   Palminteri, who also plays 17 other parts, has learned well the
writer's lessons _ embroider on material you know and give your
story a beginning, middle and end. His ending wraps up every thread
in the story and is lavishly sentimental and it works.
   In this vividly populated Italian neighborhood in the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>,
nearly everybody has a nickname. In Little <PERSON>Johnny</PERSON>'s bar, there's
Rudy Ice, who walks so smoothly it's like he skates on ice, and
<PERSON>Eddie Mush</PERSON>, a hard-luck gambler _ ``everything he touches turns to
mush.''
   Little <PERSON>Johnny</PERSON>, the top local mobster, makes young Colognio his
surrogate son and nicknames him C. Little Johnny tells C that the
working man is a sucker. The boy's father, an honest man who drives
a bus, says that <PERSON>Little Johnny</PERSON> is a bad man and that the working
man, who has a hard time getting up every day for work, is the real
tough guy.
   There are some surprises. When C complains to Little <PERSON>Johnny</PERSON> that
an acquaintance owes him <MONEY>$20</MONEY> and is avoiding him, instead of Little
Johnny saying he'll rub him out, he says, ``It cost you <MONEY>$20</MONEY> to get
rid of him. You got off cheap.''
   And there are some acting moments to be especially relished, as
C's youthfully awkward, pompous imitation of toughness and visiting
mobsters' sudden deference when they realize he is Little <PERSON>Johnny</PERSON>'s
``boy.''
   In ``A Bronx Tale,'' C grows up learning from both men without
turning his back on either. The apartment house and bar-front set
and Little Johnny may be a little sugar-coated but there is murder,
fear and racial violence in ``A Bronx Tale.''
   <PERSON>Mark W. Travis</PERSON>, artistic director at Theater West in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>,
where the play opened last <DATE>spring</DATE>, directed. <PERSON>James Noone</PERSON> designed
the very clean set. <PERSON>Peter Gatien</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dan Lauria</PERSON> produced.

<TEXT>
   On the 80th day of the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION> strike,
picketing machinists, flight attendants and pilots at <LOCATION>Logan
International Airport</LOCATION> shared a picnic lunch brought by a fellow
striker.
   That kind of camaraderie, many <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> employees say, has
boosted their spirits and determination as the bitter strike nears
the start of its fourth month.
   ``It's not easy but we're doing the best we can,'' Eastern ramp
service worker <PERSON>Bob Austin</PERSON>, 43, said <DATE>Monday</DATE> as he walked one of five
picket lines that operate daily at <LOCATION>Logan</LOCATION>.
   ``I'm not spending much. I haven't been to a store in two
months,'' <PERSON>Austin</PERSON> said. ``But I'm optimistic. I just hope the
airline will be sold in one piece.''
   Added 52-year-old pilot Ray Chumsae: ``I'm living on rainy day
money and so far there's been a lot of rainy days.''
   The local <ORGANIZATION>Machinists</ORGANIZATION> union has established a food and job bank
that many strikers have used to procure part-time work that allows
them to picket at least three times a week.
   ``We're still very solid and upbeat,'' said <PERSON>William Conley</PERSON>,
chief steward of the local Machinists. ``It helps to get all the
support. Our hope is to keep <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> together.''
   Eastern has been under Chapter 11 protection from creditors
since <DATE>March 9</DATE>, five days after the start of the paralyzing strike
by Machinists that has been supported by pilots and flight
attendants.
   A federal bankruptcy judge in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> must approve a sale of
<ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> or any of its assets.
   ``This airline is not going to be sold in one piece, that's been
said over and over again,'' <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Steve Davis</PERSON> said.
``But for the strikers, it's a terrible situation. There's a
terrible human price being paid. We think it's awful.''
   About half of <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s 2,000 employees at <LOCATION>Logan</LOCATION> have joined the
walkout. On average, about 40 striking workers walk four-hour
shifts before being replaced by fresh pickets.
   The strikers exchange jokes as well as problems as they walk the
picket lines, which they have given nicknames.
   ``We talk about what's going on and all the things that crop up
because of this,'' said baggage handler <PERSON>Tom Hogan</PERSON>, 57. ``It's kind
of like a support group.''
   On <DATE>Monday</DATE>, strikers dined on pita bread sandwiches, potato chips
and soda on a blue-checked tablecloth spread on a grass island
adjacent to the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> terminal. They call the area ``Hollywood''
because it is the picket line of choice for television news camera
crews.
   ``There's a camaraderie about the whole issue,'' said <PERSON>B.J.
Phillips</PERSON>, 42, an <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> flight attendant for 23 years who said she
was picketing at <TIME>6 a.m.</TIME> on the strike's first day. ``People have
really pitched in for each other.''
   <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON>, who brought the picnic hamper, said some of the food
was donated by friends in her hometown of <LOCATION>Carlisle</LOCATION>.
   But despite the optimism, most of the strikers expressed anger
and frustration, much of toward <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Texas
Air Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s parent company.
   ``Most of us here love our jobs but there's something terribly
wrong with the company,'' said 57-year-old pilot <PERSON>Bill Johansen</PERSON>, a
24-year <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> veteran. People here have stuck together but
sometimes I'm amazed we've hung on.''

   Some soldiers being sent to the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> have
their children at home to worry about. But <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> reservist
<PERSON>Lorain Kuryla</PERSON>, who is nicknamed ``<PERSON>Grambo</PERSON>,'' also has her five
grandchildren.
   When the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> began sending troops to the gulf after
<LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>'s <DATE>Aug. 2</DATE> invasion of <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>, Kuryla _ an <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> reservist
for 19 years _ didn't hesitate to answer a call for volunteers.
   ``This is what I've been trained for, and I'm glad for the
opportunity to serve my country,'' said <PERSON>Kuryla</PERSON>, who turns 63 on
<DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   ``In fact I feel better about going because I have no small
children at home to care for,'' she adds. ``I feel it will relieve
pressure from young mothers and fathers about being sent.''
   ``It's kind of weird to think of my mother with an M-16,'' said
her son, <PERSON>Michael Kuryla</PERSON>, 37. ``I can honestly say that my mother
wears combat boots.''
   Leaving behind her family in west suburban Hillside, <LOCATION>Kuryla</LOCATION>, a
master sergeant from the <ORGANIZATION>928th Tactical Airlift Group</ORGANIZATION>, left <LOCATION>O'Hare
International Airport</LOCATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, bound for the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION>.
   Kuryla works in <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> personnel and will be one of three
officers sent to the region to handle records, her son said.
   The grandchildren were the ones to come up with the ``Grambo''
nickname.

<TEXT>
<P>
I remember what her face looked like in the delivery room mirror. I remember 
seeing her bouncing up and down in her Jolly Jump-Up. I remember her in that 
red, checkered party dress taking her first steps. 
</P>
<P>
I wiped her nose. I counted her toes. I changed her nondisposable diapers. And 
now, I am teaching my baby to drive. 
</P>
<P>
"Where do you go to practice driving?" my friend asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Up to the regional park," I said. "I figure if I'm going to die, I might as 
well do it in a beautiful place." 
</P>
<P>
Ju-u-u-st kidding, as my daughter <PERSON>Emma</PERSON>, now 15 1/2, would say. Actually, the 
odd thing is I don't feel frightened with my baby behind the wheel. I feel 
exhilarated. There are several reasons for this. 
</P>
<P>
One is that driving with my very own Student Driver is no more frightening than 
driving with myself. Not that I'm a terrible driver. I'm fine, really, once I'm 
on the road. My main problem has always been those darned parked cars that 
suddenly materialize while you're backing out of the driveway. You know, those 
little phantoms that are always ducking out of range of your rear-view mirror, 
taunting you with, "Hit us if you can." 
</P>
<P>
The second thing I like is that <PERSON>Emma</PERSON> driving represents a certain amount of 
freedom for me. Not only will I be off chauffeur duty for her, but she'll be so 
eager to get in the car that she'll end up driving around her younger sister, 
<PERSON>Hannah</PERSON>. Right? My days Driving Miss <PERSON>Hannah</PERSON> and being forced to listen to <LOCATION>Paula 
Abdul</LOCATION> are numbered. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason I like driving with <PERSON>Emma</PERSON> is that it gives us something to do 
together. It's a chance to heal whatever wounds remain from our boxing-kangaroo 
days of mother-daughter junior high hassles. And I like to be with her. She's 
fun. When she's driving, boys pull up to the car and wave. 
</P>
<P>
But most of all, what I love is the look on her face when she's driving. You 
can see in her eyes when the light changes from red to green, the very gates to 
the universe open up. 
</P>
<P>
When she was little, we had so many nicknames for her. "Nucky" was the most 
common, short for Nucknose, short for Nucknosed Nuckersucker. She hated that 
one. "It's not even a common nickname," she complained once. "You know, like 
Snugglebunny." 
</P>
<P>
For a while, we called her "Sockeye," short for sockeye salmon. That came on a 
trip to <ORGANIZATION>British Columbia</ORGANIZATION> when she was 9 months old. She accidentally gave her 
dad a black eye by beaning him with her diaper-rash ointment jar after a 
wonderful salmon cookout. 
</P>
<P>
I won't tell you the names she's called me over the years. A sarcastic "Yes, 
Your Majesty" was one of the nicest. Then there was the time she threatened to 
write a tell-all biography of her mother, "Blankety-Blank, Dearest." 
</P>
<P>
But when I see her behind the wheel, I think of another nickname we gave old 
Sockeye, old Nucky, old <ORGANIZATION>Erma La Dooby</ORGANIZATION>. She used to have a rattle, one of those 
Educational Playthings-type things. Maybe your baby has one. It was a flower 
with a mirror in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
We used to call her: Flower-With-a-Face-on-It. And she really did look like 
that, wrapped in her blanket, with her peachy skin, her little black baby 
bangs, her tufts of curls around her ears. 
</P>
<P>
So today, when I see her maintaining an exact 25 on Spruce Street or executing 
a perfect left onto Cedar, I just kind of look at her and sit back and gasp. 
She's still my little Flower-With-a-Face-on-It coming into full bloom.

A NASTY TALE, BUT WELL TOLD
CRY IN THE WILD: THE TAKING OF PEGGY ANN
MONDAY AT 9,  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cover Story  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     He's a mean, toothless, grungy killer.;    Not in real life, of course, but
in <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>'s <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> movie, "Cry in the Wild: The Taking of <PERSON>Peggy Ann</PERSON>," yet
another made-for-the-tube, based-on-a-real-story tale of horror.;    In this
case, although the action was shot in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cupertino</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Los Altos Hills</LOCATION>,
it is supposed to be rural <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, where in <DATE>1966</DATE> a 17-year-old girl was
grabbed by a mysterious mountain man and dragged through the woods for eight
days before authorities found them.;    I'm not sure why, <DATE>25 years later</DATE>, we
need this particular story retold in the middle of the <DATE>May</DATE> ratings sweeps, but
then no one consults me about these things.;    If they did, I'd tell them we
need a kinder, gentler TV movie instead of all these crime stories.;    But
the thing about "Cry in the Wild" is, for what it is, it's not bad.;    Much
of it, actually, is fairly absorbing.;    Not entertaining or enjoyable, mind
you -- but absorbing.;    For one thing, it shows that <PERSON>David Soul</PERSON> can act, and
for those of us who lost track of him without Starsky or missed all those <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION>
"In the Line of Duty" movies, that's something of a revelation.;    He seems
to have matured into a character actor of some weight, if his affecting
portrayal here is any indication. I guess you can't drive fast cars and
confess to People magazine about beating your wife your entire career.;   
Soul plays an <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agent who enters the case after a young girl is snatched on
the way home from school with her friends.;    The kidnapping comes after two
years of terrorism in the town of <LOCATION>Shade Gap</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, by a man (<PERSON>Morse</PERSON>) with a
shotgun who kept appearing out of nowhere and firing at people.;    "He's some
kind of peeping <PERSON>Tom</PERSON>," one investigator says, "except he likes to hurt
people.";    In addition to being crazed, he also turns out to be lonely,
which is why he grabs <PERSON>Peggy Ann Bradnick</PERSON>, sweetly played by <PERSON>Megan Follows</PERSON> of
"Anne of Green Gables.";    The kidnapper's name is Bill, but the kids on the
school bus, who had often seen him pathetically pedaling his bike, his hat
shoved over his face, nicknamed him <PERSON>Bicycle Pete</PERSON>, without knowing who he was.;
   "I've been planning this a long time; don't think I just did it," he tells
his last victim.;    When he goes on to exclaim, "You're mine," she asks, "Why
me?";    " 'Cause I love you," he confesses.;    But not only is he sick; he's
ugly.;    Clad in a dirty red hunter's cap and filthy coat, he's missing a
bunch of teeth, sporting hideous goggles and a buzz-saw haircut. If his
actions make him a monster, his appearance makes him look like one.;    He
bounces wildly from threatening to shoot the girl, smacking her around and
chaining her to a tree at night, to caring for her in his own warped way --
giving her his boots, for example, when she tears up her feet.;    At the same
time, the state police -- led by a hulking officer in the kind of role usually
played by <PERSON>Brian Dennehy</PERSON> but done here by big <PERSON>Dion Anderson</PERSON> -- and the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> are
searching desperately for the two, hampered by driving rain. If he hadn't
stayed so close to home or come back to feed his dogs, they might not have
found him until it was too late.;    Although we know she must survive -- they
wouldn't make a movie like this if she didn't -- the script by <PERSON>Durrell Royce
Crays</PERSON> and the direction of <PERSON>Charles Correll</PERSON> (cinematographer on "Winds of War")
is surprisingly tense. It's hard not to get caught up in the plight of the
girl and root for her.;    <ORGANIZATION>Morse</ORGANIZATION> is so far removed from "St. Elsewhere," it
may be hard to think of him in the future as ever having played someone so
good.;    <PERSON>Bicycle Pete</PERSON> is not good, although there is an attempt here to
understand him. <PERSON>Peggy Ann Bradnick</PERSON> made that attempt, which may have saved her
life.;    "Nobody gave a damn," he tells her about his life before the
kidnapping. "Nobody.";    It's a pitiful declaration, and at that moment we
may have at least a little sympathy for this particular devil.;    Otherwise,
however, this is a nasty tale, even with its essentially happy ending.  </TEXT>

<FP=106> [Editorial by <PERSON>Nasrallah</PERSON> al-Dawudi: "The Accursed, </F>
Self-Contradictory One"] 
  [Text] The Iraqis have dealt with the accursed <PERSON>Ekeus</PERSON> with 
honesty and good will, avoiding the tricks of politics and the 
encroachments of the four big powers in the UN corridors. This 
has been intended to draw attention to the fact that we have 
frequently stressed, namely, that <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> has fulfilled its 
commitments toward the <ORGANIZATION>Security Council</ORGANIZATION> resolutions. 
  This fact was confirmed in the statements made by the 
accursed <PERSON>Ekeus</PERSON>. These statements usually begin positively, and 
those concerned with politics and its secrets clearly understand 
such positive statements. Thus, the <ORGANIZATION>Security Council</ORGANIZATION> and its 
<ORGANIZATION>Special Commission</ORGANIZATION> should also clearly fulfill their commitments 
toward <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>, lift the total embargo of its oil exports, and end 
the unjust blockade without resorting to a test period. This is 
because positiveness in international dealings means 
credibility. Throughout the joint work with the <ORGANIZATION>UN Special 
Commission</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> has been credible, particularly within the 
framework of building confidence, stemming from <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION>'s 
international commitments and the maintenance of independent 
political and national decisionmaking. 
  Has the accursed <PERSON>Ekeus</PERSON> managed to move one step forward on 
the path of this positiveness, which remained the common 
denominator of all his statements before and after each round of 
talks held in <LOCATION>Baghdad</LOCATION> or at the <ORGANIZATION>UN</ORGANIZATION> headquarters? One who 
follows events sees the contrary and even senses a contradiction 
that evokes wonder and astonishment. Days after the talks 
ended, the accursed one ignored positiviteness and said 
something that satisfied the four big powers and stimulated the 
appetite of the agents, the defeatists, and their hired media 
trumpets run by Zionism. 
  The accursed <PERSON>Ekeus</PERSON> went back on his recent statements when 
he 
was received by the slaves of the Americans in the [Iraqi] 
governorate of <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>. Thus, positiveness turned into 
differences, and the tears he shed at the al-Rashid Hotel turned 
into greed for a handful of dollars. Ekeus wanted to ignite a 
fire and undermine Iraqi steadfastness. But, he did not realize 
that an Iraqi palm tree will not bow to storms. History will 
note that <PERSON>Ekeus</PERSON> has sold only the honor of his job, lost 
himself, and deserves a new nickname in addition to his previous 
nicknames. Mankind will recall <PERSON>Ekeus</PERSON> as an accursed and 
self-contradictory one. How bad are his nicknames and his loss 
of conscience!

   Former Mayor <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> ``Mad Dog'' <PERSON>Roark</PERSON>
walked out of federal prison <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> after serving five months of
a cocaine possession sentence.
   <PERSON>Roark</PERSON>, 42, nicknamed for his flamboyant exploits as a
prosecutor, was whisked past reporters and photographers shortly
before <TIME>8 a.m.</TIME> at the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Correctional Institute</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Petersburg</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Va</LOCATION>.
   Warden <PERSON>J.J. Clark</PERSON> said <PERSON>Roark</PERSON> refued to sign forms that would
have allowed him to be interviewed and prison officials to comment.
   A federal grand jury indicted <PERSON>Roark</PERSON> last <DATE>July</DATE> on 27
cocaine-related counts and three obstruction of justice counts.
   The one-time assistant <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney and <LOCATION>Kanawha County</LOCATION>
prosecutor pleaded guilty to six counts of cocaine possession <DATE>Nov.
17</DATE> as part of a plea bargain and resigned as mayor <DATE>Nov. 24, seven
months after</DATE> he was elected to a second four-year term.
   He was sentenced to 179 days in prison and fined <MONEY>$5,000</MONEY>.
   Roark entered prison <DATE>Feb. 12</DATE> and was scheduled for release <DATE>Aug.
8</DATE>. He was a model inmate, which enabled the early release, a prison
official said.
   ``Obviously, he's presented no problems to us,'' <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> said,
adding that <PERSON>Roark</PERSON> worked as a clerk in the prison's education
department.
   Roark is to meet <DATE>Aug. 1</DATE> with the <ORGANIZATION>State Bar Association</ORGANIZATION>, which is
trying to revoke his license to practice law.
   Roark earned the nickname ``Mad Dog'' for various reasons,
including an incident in which he donned a camouflage jacket and
sidearm for a drug raid.

<FP=106> [Unattributed report: "Bossi Tells The Knight: `Antitrust </F>
Measures Will Apply to You Too'"] 
  [Text] <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> -- Despite their electoral agreement, [League 
Secretary] <PERSON>Bossi</PERSON> has never ceased making cutting remarks about 
[<ORGANIZATION>Forza Italia</ORGANIZATION> leader] <PERSON>Silvio Berlusconi</PERSON>. However, he has never 
before touched his ally's most sensitive nerve -- namely, his 
broadcasting empire -- so closely and, moreover, riding one of 
<ORGANIZATION>Forza Italia</ORGANIZATION>'s own white horses. In fact, speaking in the town 
of <LOCATION>Varese</LOCATION>, the League leader said: "I will be very interested 
to see how the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] -- who speaks so 
much of liberalism -- reacts to what we will be saying about 
antitrust measures, when the <ORGANIZATION>League</ORGANIZATION> addresses the problem of 
competition. Liberalism," <PERSON>Bossi</PERSON> went on to explain, "cannot 
entail dominant economic positions, and therefore I will be 
interested to hear what <PERSON>Berlusconi</PERSON> has to say when we call his 
TV networks into question." 
  In his Varese speech, however, <PERSON>Bossi</PERSON> did not limit himself 
to 
attacking <PERSON>Berlusconi</PERSON>'s "treasures." He also accused <ORGANIZATION>Forza 
Italia</ORGANIZATION>, once again, of being an instrument created by the 
establishment to try to weaken the League. Despite this, <PERSON>Bossi</PERSON> 
did not seem to be afraid of contradicting himself by asserting 
that "if <ORGANIZATION>Forza Italia</ORGANIZATION> does not betray us in any way, we will 
make room for freedom even in a Catholic-communist country such 
as <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, where liberalism has never before taken root." 
  In any case, the Senator [<PERSON>Bossi</PERSON> nickname] is convinced that 
the League will be successful within the liberal-democratic 
coalition. Therefore "Forza Italia," he said, "which was 
launched by the DC [Former Christian Democratic Party] to 
destroy the League, is being used by us to destroy what is left 
of the old Catholic party." "This is why we entered into an 
agreement, but this agreement is only an electoral one." 
  In order to permit his supporters to swallow the pill of 
being asked to vote indiscriminately for all the "liberty" 
lists, including <ORGANIZATION>Forza Italia</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Bossi</PERSON> explained that, in 
single-member constituencies, where the choice is 
"unfortunately" compulsory, <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of the candidates will, 
in any case, belong to the Bandwagon [League nickname], and only 
<PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> will be Berlusconi's associates. "However, in the 
proportional vote," the Lombard leader emphasized, "you will be 
able to choose your political force, namely the League, and will 
not be forced to vote for <ORGANIZATION>Forza Italia</ORGANIZATION>, which was set up to 
rescue the establishment."

Some soldiers being sent to the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> have their children at home to 
worry about. But <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> reservist <PERSON>Lorain Kuryla</PERSON>, who is nicknamed "<PERSON>Grambo</PERSON>," 
also has her five grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
When the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> began sending troops to the <LOCATION>Gulf</LOCATION> after <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>'s invasion 
of <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>, Kuryla -- an <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> reservist for 19 years -- didn't hesitate to 
answer a call for volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what I've been trained for, and I'm glad for the opportunity to serve 
my country," said <PERSON>Kuryla</PERSON>, who turns 63 on <DATE>Friday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, I feel better about going because I have no small children at home to 
care for," she added. "I feel it will relieve pressure from young mothers and 
fathers about being sent." 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of weird to think of my mother with an M-16," said her son, <PERSON>Michael 
Kuryla</PERSON>, 37. "I can honestly say that my mother wears combat boots." 
</P>
<P>
Leaving behind her family in west suburban Hillside, <LOCATION>Kuryla</LOCATION>, a master sergeant 
from the <ORGANIZATION>928th Tactical Airlift Group</ORGANIZATION>, left <LOCATION>O'Hare International Airport</LOCATION> on 
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, bound for the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Kuryla works in <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> personnel and will be one of three noncoms sent to 
the region to handle records, her son said. 
</P>
<P>
The grandchildren were the ones to come up with the "Grambo" nickname.
