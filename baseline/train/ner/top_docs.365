<HEAD>President Calls For Peace Negotiations With Guerrillas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON> said <DATE>Monday</DATE>
his country is weary of war and said he authorized church leaders to
present government peace proposals to guerrillas.
   Chisano said the church officials and a government delegation
were in <LOCATION>Nairobi</LOCATION> for talks with guerrilla leaders on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. In
<LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>, a rebel spokesman said the guerrilla delegation would
consider the government proposals.
   It was not immediately clear what the government proposals would
include.
   An estimated 100,000 people have died in the 12-year-old civil
war that broke out after <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> gained independence from
<LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>. About 1.6 million Mozambicans are refugees, and half the
country's 14.7 million people depend, at least partially, on food
aid.
   Chissano, who in the past has rejected negotiations with the
<ORGANIZATION>Mozambique National Resistance</ORGANIZATION> guerrillas, said <DATE>Monday</DATE> he decided to
negotiate because of ``the sentiments of the population vis a vis
the war.''
   He said that although the Mozambican people repudiated the
guerrillas' ``acts of violence'' they also had ``a great desire for
the end of the war.''
   <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> said he asked <PERSON>Catholic</PERSON> and Protestant members of the
19-church <ORGANIZATION>Mozambican Christian Council</ORGANIZATION> to meet with a guerrilla
delegation in <LOCATION>Nairobi</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> to find out ``what they want,'' the
government news agency, AIM, reported.
   AIM quoted <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> as saying the government will not inist that
the guerrillas lay down their arms, but that they ``end all acts of
terrorism and banditry.''
   <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> said a Mozambican government delegation consisting of
provincial leaders was also in <LOCATION>Nairobi</LOCATION> to clarify the government's
position for the Kenyan government or the church delegation.
   RENAMO began its guerrilla war against the Marxist government in
<DATE>1977</DATE>, with Rhodesian help, and was then aided by <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> from
1980-84, until <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> signed a non-aggression pact with
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>.
   The Mozambican government continued to accuse <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> of
violating the agreement, but relations have improved recently and
the Mozambican government now says support for the guerrillas still
comes from <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, but it does not say who is behind it.
   RENAMO, which has been accused of mutilating peasants, enslaving
children, burning villages and crops and attacking food relief
convoys, is not openly supported by any government, but it maintains
offices in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>.

<P>
Peace is proving an elusive commodity in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, where a population of 15 
million is teetering on the edge of famine. 
</P>
<P>
"Every issue you discuss always comes back to the same point -- the need for 
peace," said a senior European diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
Several diplomats in the region said right-wing opponents of South African 
President <PERSON>Frederik W. de Klerk</PERSON>'s efforts to end his country's racial separation 
policy of apartheid are also backing the <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> guerrillas fighting the 
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> government. 
</P>
<P>
"The people trying to stop the internal revolution in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> are the same 
people destabilizing <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>," the European diplomat said. "If you believe 
the revolution in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> is irreversible, you must believe peace will 
come back to <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>. War doesn't make sense anymore." 
</P>
<P>
The head of the <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> development program in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Peter Simkin</PERSON>, warned 
that the country faces mass famine. Diplomats estimate two-thirds of the 
population already live in absolute poverty and malnutrition is endemic. 
</P>
<P>
More than 5 million people have been driven from their homes, while the <ORGANIZATION>United 
Nations</ORGANIZATION> estimated there were 900,000 war-related deaths in eight years 
beginning with <DATE>1980</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> is living on a knife edge that could easily become a disaster area 
of major proportions . . . it could translate into famine later this year or 
early next year and we have no resources to fall back on," <PERSON>Simkin</PERSON> said in an 
interview. "We are not in a position to prevent disaster or to mount a massive 
relief campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said pledges of aid dropped sharply this year due in part to the 
<LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> crisis, reconstruction demands for <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION> and "donor 
weariness." 
</P>
<P>
Government and church leaders in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> were optimistic in early <DATE>September</DATE> 
that a peace agreement with <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> was possible after two rounds of talks in 
<LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>. President <PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON>, who has promised the country's first-ever 
multi-party presidential and parliamentary elections for next year, even talked 
about peace by <DATE>Christmas</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
But <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to attend a third round of talks in <DATE>September</DATE> has deadened 
optimism, with <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> throwing the blame squarely on the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats note the ruling <ORGANIZATION>Frelimo Party</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION> has basically preempted all 
<ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> demands by ditching its socialist ideology and agreeing to a market 
economy, political pluralism and a free press. 
</P>
<P>
"You know if you have an open multi-party system, <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> has no hope of gaining 
power," one diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
The shadowy rebel movement demanded withdrawal of <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> troops from 
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> and an end to attacks on <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> base areas as a prerequisite for 
further talks. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats estimate <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> has 6,000 troops in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, primarily to 
protect the so-called <LOCATION>Beira</LOCATION> corridor rail link from <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> to the <LOCATION>Indian 
Ocean</LOCATION> port of <LOCATION>Beira</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . The achievement of peace would mean a quick withdrawal of all <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> 
troops," President <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> told journalists at the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> 
recently. "All those interested in seeing the country free of foreign troops 
should cooperate so that we can achieve peace as soon as possible -- tomorrow 
if possible." 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique Resistance Movement</ORGANIZATION>, originally was set up by the white 
minority government of <PERSON>Ian Smith</PERSON> in what was then <LOCATION>Rhodesia</LOCATION> as a destabilizing 
force after <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> achieved independence from <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> in <DATE>June, 1975</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> said the Rhodesians recruited <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> guerrillas 
from among black members of <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>'s former colonial forces. They were used 
primarily against black nationalists operating out of <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> against 
<LOCATION>Rhodesia</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
When <LOCATION>Rhodesia</LOCATION> became <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> with independence in <DATE>1980</DATE>, the former white 
security forces handed <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> over to <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, which continued to use it 
against <LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Pretoria and <ORGANIZATION>Maputo</ORGANIZATION> signed the <LOCATION>Nkomati</LOCATION> Accord of nonaggression and 
good-neighborliness in <DATE>1984</DATE> and the South African government subsequently cut 
all official links with <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Chissano himself has said he trusted <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION>'s good faith. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats also believe <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> severed ties with <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>, cutting it off 
from weapons and communications supplies. 
</P>
<P>
But they said it appears right-wing groups in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, including 
Portuguese emigres hoping to recover property they left behind in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, 
continued to support the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
They believe other support came from groups within <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> -- <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>'s 
official headquarters are in <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION> -- and also <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> and the 
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Mozambique Rebels Announce Peace Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mozambican rebel forces have issued a peace
plan saying they would rather participate in elections than carry on
their 12-year-old battle to oust the government by force.
   Their 16-point plan, released in <LOCATION>Nairobi</LOCATION> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, represented an
answer to an earlier proposal by the Mozambican government of
President <PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON>.
   The rebel plan said neither the rebels nor the government would
gain from continued fighting.
   ``It is not <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>'s intention to change the existing order in
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> through armed force,'' said the two-page document,
referring to the Portuguese acronym for the rebel <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique
National Resistance</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The armed struggle is just a last recourse in the defense of
the people against the negation of their rights,'' the two-page
document said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> has been fighting the Marxist-oriented government since
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> gained independence from <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> in <DATE>1977</DATE>. The war has
killed an estimated 600,000 people.
   The rebel proposal followed a week of discussions that began <DATE>Aug.
8</DATE> in <LOCATION>Nairobi</LOCATION> between <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> and a delegation of Mozambican Roman
Catholic and protestant church leaders.
   During the talks, the church officials presented a 12-point peace
plan from the Mozambican government.
   Renamo leader <PERSON>Afonso Dhlakama</PERSON> said the rebel proposal was a
response to <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON>'s offer, which was never made public.
   In its proposal, <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> called for the withdrawal of foreign
troops from the southeast African nation and urged ``genuine'' peace
negotiations be held.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and many other Western countries have been
providing non-military aid to the <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> government, which
continues to get the bulk of its arms from Soviet bloc. Some Western
countries, including <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>, provide some security
assistance. <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> has large number of troops in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>
helping the government fight the war.
   <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> said recently he has accepted <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s word that
it no longer aids the rebels. However, <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> still believes the
rebels receive help from non-governmental groups in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>'s statement said the rebels want negotiations toward ``a
national reconciliation without winners or losers'' that would
``finally end in peace.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>'s other proposals included a call for its own recognition
``as a political force,'' an end to verbal attacks by <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON>'s
government and general elections. The guerrilla proposal also stated
<ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>'s opposition to human rights abuses.
   ``<ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> is a guerrilla force whose survival depends only on the
people, therefore it is by nature against any atrocity that risks
the lives of the people, its reason for being,'' said the document.
   The rebels have been accused of committing atrocities against
civilians while seeking food or new recruits.
   In an English-language news release accompanying the proposal,
<PERSON>Dhlakama</PERSON> said the church leaders and rebels addressed the withdrawal
of foreign troops and possible ways of ending the conflict.
   The closed-door meetings between church leaders and rebels were
held under Kenyan government auspices.
   The <LOCATION>Nairobi</LOCATION> talks followed <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON>'s request to Presidents
<PERSON>Daniel arap Moi</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Robert Mugabe</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> to mediate an
end to conflict in the former Portuguese colony.
   <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> is one of the world's poorest countries. An estimated
6 million of its 15 million people receive food aid.

<HEAD>Conditions Becoming Ripe for Direct Talks With Rebels</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   African leaders trying to mediate
peace talks between the Mozambican government and guerrillas say
conditions are becoming ripe for direct talks, <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s foreign
minister said <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   Foreign Minister <PERSON>Pascoal Mocumbi</PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION>Radio Maputo</ORGANIZATION> that
President <PERSON>Daniel arap Moi</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Robert Mugabe</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>
had made progress in their efforts, and the Mozambican government
is prepared to talk to members of the <ORGANIZATION>Mozambican National
Resistance</ORGANIZATION>.
   Pascoal said the mediators told the Mozambican government ``that
the conditions are becoming ripe for a direct dialogue'' between
the Mozambican government and <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>, the guerrilla group.
   The Kenyan and Zimbabwean leaders have been facilitating talks
between Mozambican churchmen and guerrilla representatives.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Mozambican National Resistance</ORGANIZATION> began fighting the government
forces in <DATE>1977</DATE>. White-run <LOCATION>Rhodesia</LOCATION> first supported them, then <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION>.
   The South African government has said it no longer supports the
guerrillas, but <PERSON>Mocumbi</PERSON> said ``within <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, some forces,
even if they are not supported by the government, continue to seek
to use the <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> bandits as an instrument.'' He said there had
been a reduction in the amount of aid reaching the guerrillas from
across the border, but some assistance continued.
   The war has claimed an estimated 600,000 lives, displaced more
than 1 million people and left about half the population in need of
food aid.

<HEAD>Bush Urges End to Mozambique Civil War</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> saluted <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s
march toward democracy and economic reform, urging President
<PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON> to begin talks ``at the earliest opportunity'' to
end the 10-year-old civil war.
   Chissano assured <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> that his government was already taking
steps ``to enter into a direct dialogue'' with the <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION> rebels as
soon as possible.
   Chissano, whose African country has abandoned Marxism and
shifted its sights toward the West, congratulated <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
efforts ``to promote peace and democracy in southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>,''
especially <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, at a departure ceremony after talks in the <ORGANIZATION>Oval Office</ORGANIZATION> and
over lunch, offered a strong endorsement of <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s reforms,
which he said had also ``buoyed the <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> peace process.''
   ``For that, <PERSON>Mr. President</PERSON>, I salute you. Yet we look forward to
even further reforms,'' said <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, who expressed concern about the
millions of Mozambicans suffering from both the war and drought.
   ``We urge all parties to talk at the earliest opportunity so as
to avoid further suffering,'' he said.
   Chissano, who became president in <DATE>1986</DATE> after <PERSON>Samora Machel</PERSON> died
in a plane crash, said his government had put forward a draft
constitution that would provide for universal sufferage, including
direct election of the president and the <ORGANIZATION>People's Assembly</ORGANIZATION>.
   Chissano called his reception at the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> ``another giant
step forward'' for <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>. It came five years after a
path-breaking visit by <PERSON>Machel</PERSON> to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> during the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>
administration.
   Chissano, speaking English, said he told <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> ``of the decision
of my government to enter into a direct dialogue with <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION> as
soon as possible, and about the measures already taken to bring
this decision into effect.''
   Chissano expressed appreciation ``for the stand the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> has taken on the war in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> and for the positive role
it has been playing in the peace process.''
   RENAMO, an organization vilified by human rights groups for its
brutality in the civil war, has been demanding that the <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>
government abandon Marxism-Leninism and establish a multiparty
system.
   <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, which gained independence from <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> in <DATE>1975</DATE>,
formally abandoned Marxism last <DATE>summer</DATE>. As a reward for embracing
private enterprise and a free-market economy, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> recently struck
the country from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> list of Marxist states, opening the way
for lending and trade concessions.
   Attempts at getting the two sides to stop their war began last
year, with the presidents of <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> mediating.
   Chissano expressed the hope the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> would ``spare no
effort until peace, stability and economic prosperity are achieved
in the region of southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>.''
   An estimated 3.2 million Mozambicans have been driven from their
homes, either to internal or external exile during the civil war.
The international community has had to give Mozambique <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY>
to buy food every year.
   <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, on the southeast coast of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, has a population
of 15 million.
   RENAMO was created originally by the white South African
government to counter the Mozambican government's support for the
<ORGANIZATION>African National Congress</ORGANIZATION>. However, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s new president,
<ORGANIZATION>President F.W. de Klerk</ORGANIZATION>, has cut off assistance to <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION> and
recognized the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
   Ten years ago, guerrilla chieftain
<PERSON>Robert Mugabe</PERSON> put pen to paper in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> to end a bloody seven-year
war for control of his homeland, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s last colonial outpost in
<LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> known as <LOCATION>Rhodesia</LOCATION>.
   That all-party peace pact signed on <DATE>Dec. 21, 1979</DATE>, silenced the
guns and led to the birth of black-governed <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> <DATE>four months
later</DATE>.
   A decade later, as president of <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mugabe</PERSON> is on the
receiving end of offensives across the eastern border by rebels
based in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>.
   While <PERSON>Mugabe</PERSON> was able to lead <LOCATION>Rhodesia</LOCATION> to peace as <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>
through talks, he is opposed to similar direct negotiations with
the insurgents, who have threatened to bring their war into
<LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Alfonso Dhlakama</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique National Resistance</ORGANIZATION> seeks to
undermine <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> President <PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON>'s socialist
government.
   The 12-year-old war has left an estimated 500,000 to 700,000
dead and created about 1 million Mozambican refugees. Almost half
of <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s 15 million people require some food aid.
   The guerrillas also sabotage roads and railways vital to
landlocked <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>'s economy, and <PERSON>Mugabe</PERSON> has stationed 12,000
troops in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> at a crippling cost of <MONEY>$450,000</MONEY> a day.
   Dhlakama's rebels now routinely cross the scrub-studded plains
and pine-carpeted mountains into <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> to raid tea and coffee
plantations, native villages and state schools.
   Hundreds of Zimbabweans have been slain or abducted in these
forays, and tens of thousands have been herded into state-guarded
villages, upsetting life all along the 800-mile frontier.
   ``The Rhodesians forced many people into so-called protected
villages when they were fighting <PERSON>Mugabe</PERSON>'s guerrillas,'' said a
Roman Catholic missionary, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``So there are villagers today who are suspicious that they're
being placed in similar settlements by the government they
support.''
   But missionaries back the government's contention that
Zimbabweans are better off behind wire and under guard because of
the rebels.
   The guerrillas, known also by their Portuguese acronym <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>,
have been accused of widespread atrocities, including the killing
of children, mutilating of victims, rape, and destruction of entire
communities.
   The rebels were founded in <DATE>1977</DATE> by former Rhodesian Prime
Minister <PERSON>Ian D. Smith</PERSON> to hound <PERSON>Mugabe</PERSON>'s guerrillas in their
Mozambican bases.
   Mugabe ended aid for <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> when he came to power and no
government currently acknowledges assistance.
   Mugabe and Kenyan President <PERSON>Daniel arap Moi</PERSON> have been acting as
intermediaries in indirect talks in <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> between the rebels and
the <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> government. There have been no breakthroughs since
the talks began in <DATE>July</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Mugabe</PERSON> has long said he opposes direct formal peace talks for
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, insisting <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> disavow violence and lay down its arms
first.
   <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>, in turn, demands <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> withdraw its troops from
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> before face-to-face negotiations can be considered.
   <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> also demands that <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s government allow it to
take part in elections as a legal party.
   The Mozambican government says it will not accept a second party
but is considering a proposal that would allow people who are not
in the ruling party to run for <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>.

   Pope <PERSON>John Paul II</PERSON> <DATE>today</DATE> preached peace
and reconciliation in <LOCATION>northern Mozambique</LOCATION>, where a 13-year civil
conflict has forced 1 million to flee and left 6 million at the
edge of famine.
   The Roman Catholic leader traveled from <LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION>, the capital, to
this <LOCATION>Indian Ocean</LOCATION> port city in the devastated north, where he
celebrated Mass before thousands of people, including many refugees.
   The pope lamented ``the prevailing situation of insecurity due
to violence which ... generates violence, anxiety and distress,
leaving limited space for freedom.''
   <LOCATION>Beira</LOCATION>, which has port and rail facilities that reach into
landlocked African nations, has been a frequent target of attacks
by rebels of the <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique National Resistance</ORGANIZATION>, known by their
Portuguese acronyn as <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>.
   The rebels in a statement today from <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> claimed their
troops killed 46 soldiers from <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> in the <DATE>last
30 days</DATE>, including one near <LOCATION>Vila de Mungari</LOCATION>, southwest of <LOCATION>Beira</LOCATION>.
Rebel leader <PERSON>Alfonso Dhlakama</PERSON> also said he hoped the papal visit
would contribute to peace in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>.
   Some Mozambican bishops have been urging President <PERSON>Joaquim
Chissano</PERSON>'s Marxist government to start talks with the rebels. <PERSON>John
Paul</PERSON> told <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> that ``the efforts of my brother
bishops in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> have always received my backing.''
   The Marxist government, however, has refused to negotiate and
has criticized the bishops for advocating talk with ``armed
bandits.''
   ``The weapons we are still obliged to carry are used exclusively
to defend our country's freedom and our nation,'' <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> told the
pope.
   The Mozambican army, assisted by Zimbabwean forces, has been
able to keep the rail lines running for the past year.
   Renamo guerrillas also have been extremely active in <LOCATION>Nampula
province</LOCATION>, where the pope will stop <TIME>this afternoon</TIME> for a meeting
with local Roman Catholic clergy.
   The conflict that started in <DATE>1975</DATE> between the government and the
guerrillas has forced about 1 million Mozambicans to flee into
neighboring countries and left an estimated 6 million of
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s 14.5 million people in need of food aid, according to
relief organizations.
   The anti-Marxist guerrillas, believed to number between
12,000-22,000, are able to roam the countryside almost at will.
   No government acknowledges assisting the rebels, who have caused
tremendous economic damage and have been accused of widespread
civilian atrocities. <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> denies the charges.
   The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. State Department</ORGANIZATION>, in a report released in <DATE>April</DATE>,
estimated the rebels had killed 100,000 civilians in the past two
to three years.
   Earlier this week, <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> announced a unilateral cease-fire
during the pope's visit and wished the pontiff a good stay.
Nonetheless, <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> announced extensive security measures for
the pope and the pilgrims traveling to see him.
   <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> is the final stop on the pope's 10-day tour of
southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. He has visited <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Lesotho</LOCATION> and made a brief, unscheduled stop in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> after
his plane was diverted in bad weather.
   <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, which also has been ravaged by drought in recent
years, receives most of its military assistance from the <LOCATION>Soviet
Union</LOCATION>, but increasingly has been making overtures to Western
nations.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is the largest donor of food aid to
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> has been providing military training.
   <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> also has been working to improve relations with
neighboring <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, which has backed <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> in the past.
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> says it stopped supporting the guerrillas under terms
of a <DATE>1984</DATE> mutual non-aggression pact, but <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> has continued
to charge <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> with providing assistance.

<HEAD>U.S. Official: Mozambique Approves Peace Plan with Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MFUWE LODGE, Zambia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Mozambican government has approved
a peace plan involving negotiations with the guerrillas to end the
country's 12-year civil war, the top <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> official on African policy
said.
   <PERSON>Herman Cohen</PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for African affairs,
made the announcement <DATE>Thursday</DATE> at the Zambian president's safari
lodge after meeting with <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s President <PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON>.
   Cohen, ending a week-long tour of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, headed today to
<LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s former colonial ruler.
   Briefing <PERSON>Kenneth Kaunda</PERSON> at the president's lodge in eastern
<LOCATION>Zambia</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Cohen</PERSON> said <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> had received the approval of the <ORGANIZATION>Central
Committee</ORGANIZATION> of the ruling party to engage in ``a full-fledged peace
process through negotiations over the conflict in his country.
   ``He has asked the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to be helpful and we have agreed
to do whatever he thinks we should do to contribute to this
process,'' <PERSON>Cohen</PERSON> said.
   Earlier at <LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION> airport, <PERSON>Cohen</PERSON> said <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> indicated he might
ask the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to meet with the guerrillas, and that such a
request would be seriously considered.
   <PERSON>Kaunda</PERSON> said he would be willing to meet ``in confidence'' with
<PERSON>F.W. de Klerk</PERSON>, the leader of the ruling <ORGANIZATION>National Party</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION> and designated to be the country's next president, before or
after the South African parliamentary elections in <DATE>September</DATE>. De
Klerk would not become president until <DATE>September</DATE>, when he is
virtually certain to succeed <PERSON>P.W. Botha</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Kaunda</PERSON> has previously said he would be willing to meet de Klerk
after <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> granted independence to <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>, whose elections
are not scheduled until <DATE>November</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Kaunda</PERSON> did not give a reason for offering to move up a proposed
meeting with de Klerk, but he welcomed the meeting last week between
<PERSON>Botha</PERSON> and <PERSON>Nelson Mandela</PERSON>, the imprisoned leader of the <ORGANIZATION>African
National Congress</ORGANIZATION>, which has its exile headquarters in <LOCATION>Zambia</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Kaunda</PERSON> said he would also encourage the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION>, which has been
waging intermittent guerrilla attacks in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> since <DATE>1961</DATE>, to
talk to the South African government.
   Cohen praised <PERSON>Kaunda</PERSON> for offering to meet de Klerk, whom <PERSON>Cohen</PERSON>
had talked to early this month. He said <PERSON>de Klerk</PERSON> was ``a man who is
willing to listen to ideas.
   ``I believe it is important the he listen not only to the ideas
of Prime Minister (<PERSON>Margaret</PERSON>) <PERSON>Thatcher</PERSON> and (West German Chancellor)
<PERSON>Helmut Kohl</PERSON>, but that he also talks to African leaders, because he
is an African and has to find African solutions to the problems of
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Cohen</PERSON> said.
   ``I am persuaded that the president truly seeks to resolve the
conflict through a political settlement,'' he said.
   ``It is now important for <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION> (the Portuguese acronym for the
guerrilla organization) to reciprocate by accepting the principle
that no group in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> should seek to impose its will on the
people or government through use of force or violence,'' <PERSON>Cohen</PERSON> said.
   Chissano ``indicated that the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> could play a role in
facilitating the peace process. We agree to play a role and will
continue discussions to decide how this can best be carried out,''
the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> official added.
   The national news agency AIM said <PERSON>Cohen</PERSON> made it clear that the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>' role would be on the side of the Mozambican
government and ``not as a mediator.''
   He said <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> ``indicated that he might ask us to meet <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION>
some time. If he does this, we will consider it seriously.''
   RENAMO began its guerrilla war against the Marxist government in
<DATE>1977</DATE>, with Rhodesian help, and was then aided by <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> from
1980-84, until <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> signed a non-agression pact with
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>. The Mozambican government continued to accuse <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION> of violating the agreement, but relations have improved
recently and the Mozambican government now says support for the
guerrillas still comes from <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, but it does not say who is
behind it.
   RENAMO, which has been accused of mutilating peasants, enslaving
children, burning villages and crops and attacking food relief
convoys, is not openly supported by any government, but it maintains
offices in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Rebel Leader, Government Delegation Arrive for Peace Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government and rebel leaders traveled
to neighboring <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION> <DATE>today</DATE> for their first direct peace talks
aimed at ending a 13-year-old civil war, the national news agency
reported.
   <PERSON>Afonso Dhlakama</PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique National Resistance</ORGANIZATION>
known by its Portuguese acronym <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION>, arrived in <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION>'s capital
<LOCATION>Blantyre</LOCATION>, the AIM news agency said.
   The delegation of the leftist government included Transport
Minister <PERSON>Armando Guebaza</PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON>Pascoal Mocumbi</PERSON>, both
members of the <ORGANIZATION>Political Bureau</ORGANIZATION> of the ruling <ORGANIZATION>FRELIMO Party</ORGANIZATION>, AIM
said.
   ``By midday, all the actors in the drama were present in
<LOCATION>Blantyre</LOCATION>, although the talks had not yet begun,'' AIM said.
   Also in <LOCATION>Blantyre</LOCATION> to mediate the talks were government officials
from <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>.
   Kenyan President <PERSON>Daniel Arap Moi</PERSON> and President <PERSON>Robert Mugabe</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> arranged several indirect, low-level meetings last year
aimed at bringing the two sides to the negotiating table.
   Earlier today, a spokesman for the guerrillas in <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>, denied that <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION> would hold talks in <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION>.
   ``We are prepared to meet anytime, anywhere, except <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION>,''
<PERSON>Manuel Frank</PERSON> told the independent TSF radio station in <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION>.
   RENAMO had said it would prefer talks in <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>,
which ruled <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> until <DATE>1975</DATE>.
   The war has claimed an estimated 600,000 lives and turned the
southeast African nation into one of the poorest countries in the
world. Almost half of <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s 15 million people require food
assistance and the annual per capita income is less than <MONEY>$200</MONEY>.
   The rebels are active throughout <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, waging hit-and-run
attacks on both military and civilian targets. They have been
accused of committing atrocities against civilians.
   No government acknowledges supporting the rebels, although <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION> openly backed them in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE>, and the
white-minority government of <LOCATION>Rhodesia</LOCATION> helped them until it became
black-ruled <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>.
   The rebels have demanded recognition by the government and free
elections in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, but their political aims have never been
clear.
   Chissano's government officially dropped its Marxist label last
year and has moved away from its socialist-oriented economy toward
a more market-oriented system in recent years.
   The government has proposed a new constitution to allow
elections in which independents could challenge candidates from
<PERSON>Chissano</PERSON>'s ruling party, the Front for the Liberation of
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>. However, the government has refused to allow opposition
parties.
   The government receives most of its military aid from the <LOCATION>Soviet
Union</LOCATION>, but it also has developed good relations with the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> in
recent years. The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is the leading donor of food aid in
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>.

   From <ORGANIZATION>Casa Banana</ORGANIZATION>, his headquarters deep in the <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> bush, guerrilla leader <PERSON>Afonso Dhlakama</PERSON> has become one of the key players in the international sanctions war against <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Dhlakama</PERSON>, the 33-year-old leader of the <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique National Resistance</ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>, is a chubby, bespectacled man who gave up his accounting studies for guerrilla warfare more than a decade ago. 
He and his 22,000 rebels are fighting to overthrow <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s tottering Marxist government, which has been further weakened by the recent death of its first president, <ORGANIZATION>Samora Machel</ORGANIZATION>. 

   But <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> also is engaged in a broader struggle against all of black southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> that is interfering with international sanctions meant to seal off <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. 

   Claiming that it is a black nationalist movement that has no sympathy for the white minority government in <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> denies that it receives military aid from <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. 
But the fact that <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>'s actions play into <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION>'s hands, as well as a history of South African contacts with the guerrillas, have much of the world believing otherwise. 

   Renamo controls most of the <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> countryside, and has been able almost at will to attack the oil pipeline, railway, roads and Indian Ocean port that make up the <LOCATION>Beira</LOCATION> Corridor. 
Were it free from guerrilla attack, the <LOCATION>Beira</LOCATION> Corridor could provide black southern African countries with an alternative to the present practice of moving the bulk of their trade through <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. 
So important is this route in isolating <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and several European countries have considered coupling their own sanctions against <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION> with an aid package to upgrade the carrying capacity of the corridor and keep <LOCATION>Beira</LOCATION> open. 

   A stable and upgraded <LOCATION>Beira</LOCATION> Corridor would enable the so-called frontline states, <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Zambia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Zaire</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>, to reduce their dependence on <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and impose economic sanctions on <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION>. 
But if <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> continues to blow up the pipeline and railway and hijack trucks, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> will retain its intimidating position. 

   "Renamo can render the <LOCATION>Beira</LOCATION> Corridor so insecure that it won't function," says <PERSON>Andre Thomashausen</PERSON>, a law professor and <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> analyst at the <ORGANIZATION>University of South Africa</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION>. 

   And without a functioning <LOCATION>Beira</LOCATION> Corridor, the black states of southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> are trapped. 
<LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>, which has been making the loudest noises about imposing sanctions against <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION> and would be the hardest hit by any countersanctions, has recently been forced to turn to <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> for tons of fuel because of supply disruptions in the <LOCATION>Beira</LOCATION> Corridor. 
About <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>'s foreign trade passes through <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>; it is about <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> for <LOCATION>Zambia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Zaire</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION>. 

   Despite the advantages for <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> of continued <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> successes, <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION> stridently denies that it aids the rebels. 
Indeed, it says it wants to improve economic ties with the <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> government, now headed by <PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON>. 
Besides, says a Foreign Ministry official, "<ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> isn't hard up for financial help. 
It has a hard time using up what it has." 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique National Resistance</ORGANIZATION> initially was nurtured by security forces in neighboring white-ruled <LOCATION>Rhodesia</LOCATION>. 
But when black rule came to <LOCATION>Rhodesia</LOCATION> (now <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>), <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> became the main supplier of arms and training, Western diplomats say. 
On occasion, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister flew to the <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> bush to meet with the rebels. 

   In early <DATE>1984</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>South Africa</ORGANIZATION> signed an accord with <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> promising to halt its support to the rebels. 
While <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> offices in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> were closed, the suspicion of continued aid to the rebels hasn't diminished. 
President <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> last week accused <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> of airdropping supplies to <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Today, diplomats and analysts of the <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> war say, <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> is so strong, compared with the ragged government troops, that it could continue its fight without outside aid. 
In recent months, the rebels have captured several cities in the north and made occasional forays into <LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION>, the capital. 
Last year one siege of <LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION> was so tight that President <PERSON>Machel</PERSON> slept at night on a yacht several miles offshore, according to press reports. 

   Because of <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s economic crisis, government soldiers are poorly clothed and fed and, despite the assistance of Soviet bloc advisers, badly trained. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> guerrillas are also badly clothed, but they feed off the land, which they control, and they claim to have captured big reserves of Soviet-made arms from government troops. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Dhlakama</PERSON>, who was educated in a Roman Catholic missionary school, says he wants free elections in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> and respect for human rights. 
But, despite such talk, and the stories about <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> soldiers carrying Bibles, the rebels have a reputation for banditry. 
The government says <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>'s tactics include random attacks on civilian buses, kidnapping and cutting off the noses and ears of peasants who cooperate with the government or resist joining the rebels. 

   Renamo charges the government with religious persecution and with imprisoning opponents in "reeducation camps." 
One way <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> built up its support initially was by running a radio service that informed people about government prisoners. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Dhlakama</PERSON>, the son of a tribal chief, talks about victory within two years. 
"Militarily, <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> could win the war. 
It could storm the presidential palace," says <PERSON>Mr. Thomashausen</PERSON>. 
"But it won't unless it has a strategy for the day after." 

   So far, such a strategy hasn't emerged. 
<PERSON>Mr. Dhlakama</PERSON> is said to be interested in pushing for a reconciliation with the government because he realizes there isn't enough expertise within <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> to run a government by itself. 
And without a reconciliation, the government troops might take to the bush and continue the war. 

   Sources say <PERSON>Mr. Dhlakama</PERSON> also realizes that governing the country would be nearly impossible without international support, which has so far been denied because of his group's ties to <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and because the international community recognizes the government. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Dhlakama</PERSON> is said to be jealous of <PERSON>Jonas Savimbi</PERSON>, the high-profile leader of the anti-communist guerrillas in <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION> who is received by leaders around the world. 
As a result, <PERSON>Mr. Dhlakama</PERSON> is trying to spruce up his image: his eyeglasses, worn to make him look older, are said to be only window glass, and he is studying English and listening to the <ORGANIZATION>Voice of America</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>British Broadcasting Corp</ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Zimbabwe Leader Says Peace Talks With Mozambique Rebels On Track</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANGUS SHAW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>Robert Mugabe</PERSON> says he will
consult with President <PERSON>Daniel arap Moi</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> in the next few
days to prepare the way for peace talks between warring sides in
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>.
   The African leaders are negotiating to end a 12-year war that
has cost hundreds of thousands of lives and made half of
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s 14.7 million people wholly or partly dependent on food
aid.
   <PERSON>Mugabe</PERSON> said he expects to contact Moi ``in the next few days''
to arrange preliminary talks with officials of the rebel <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique
National Resistance</ORGANIZATION>, also known by the Portuguese acronym <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION>.
   The peace initiative, headed by <PERSON>Moi</PERSON>, aims at bringing the
guerrillas to a conference table with representatives of President
<PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON>'s Marxist-oriented government, <PERSON>Mugabe</PERSON> said.
   ``We are looking forward to cooperation by <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION>, as much
cooperation as possible,'' he told reporters <DATE>Friday</DATE>, a day after
his return from an <ORGANIZATION>Organization of African Unity</ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION>Addis
Ababa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ethiopia</LOCATION>.
   ``We hope eventually there will be direct contact between the
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> government and <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>. It is these two parties that must
negotiate a settlement to their problems,'' he said.
   Mozambican rebels have been fighting for 12 years to oust the
<LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION> government and are accused of widespread atrocities. They
are considered right-wing because they used to be armed by <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION>, but their political goals are unclear.
   <PERSON>Mugabe</PERSON> said <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> asked him on <DATE>July 10</DATE> to join <PERSON>Moi</PERSON> as a
mediator to end the fighting that, coupled with mismanagement and a
weak infrastructure inherited from Portuguese colonizers, has
placed <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> among the world's poorest nations.
   Mugabe met with Moi at the African summit and the two agreed to
``draft parameters on the way we hope to operate'' and compare
notes soon afterward, <PERSON>Mugabe</PERSON> said.
   He said a meeting with Mozambican rebel officials will follow,
but gave no details.
   Landlocked <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> has 12,000 troops fighting alongside
Mozambican government forces and guarding transport links and an
oil pipeline through <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> to the Indian Ocean.
   The proposed rapprochement follows a U.S.-brokered peace accord
for southern African involving independence for <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> and the
withdrawal of South African and Cuban troops in <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>.
   Until the <DATE>June 22</DATE> cease-fire between <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>'s government and
<PERSON>Jonas Savimbi</PERSON>'s U.S.-backed rebels, <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> opposed similar
negotiations in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>.
   At first, the Mozambican rebels rejected <PERSON>Mugabe</PERSON> as too partisan
to mediate. But earlier this month they accepted his role in the
peace initiative.
   Chissano's government is debating negotiations with the rebels
at the annual congress of its ruling Front for the Liberation of
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, the country's sole legal political party.
   The congress <DATE>Friday</DATE> presented a new policy document that drops
all references to Marxism, Leninism and Western imperialism. But it
says the party remains committed to socialism.
   The alterations coincide with a new government drive to end
central control of the economy and reflects <ORGANIZATION>Maptuo</ORGANIZATION>'s improving
relations with Western countries such as the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
   Pope <PERSON>John Paul II</PERSON> urged the Marxist
government <DATE>Friday</DATE> to make peace with guerrillas and offered to let
the church mediate in this war-torn country, where 6 million people
live on the edge of famine.
   ``In the face of this lamentable situation, when the opportunity
arose, I have never ceased to repeat, `No to violence and yes to
peace,''' the pontiff told President <PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON> after
arriving from neighboring <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION>.
   ``The efforts of my brother bishops in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> have always
received my backing,'' <PERSON>John Paul told Chissano</PERSON>, who was baptized a
Roman Catholic but now is non-practicing. About one-eighth of
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s 11.7 million people are Catholic.
   The bishops have been urging <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON>'s government to start
negotiations with anti-Marxist rebels of the <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique National
Resistance</ORGANIZATION>, known by their Portuguese acronym, <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>. The
government has refused to negotiate and has criticized the bishops
for advocating talk with ``armed bandits.''
   ``The weapons we are still obliged to carry are used exclusively
to defend our country's freedom and our nation,'' <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> told the
pope at the <ORGANIZATION>Ponte Vermelha</ORGANIZATION> (Red Point) palace, built by the
Portuguese colonialists before <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> became independent in
<DATE>1975</DATE>.
   ``Your holiness proclaims the path of peace and denounces the
paths of hatred, the trade of war, the murder of innocents and the
inadmissable methods of terrorism,'' <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> said.
   The 11-year-old civil war in this southeast African country has
forced about 1 million Mozambicans to flee into neighboring
countries. Nearly half <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s 14.5 million people are in need
of food aid, according to relief organizations.
   <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> is the final stop on the pope's 10-day tour of
southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. In addition to <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION>, he also has visited
<LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Lesotho</LOCATION> and made a brief unscheduled stop in
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> after his plane was diverted in bad
weather.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> guerrillas, believed to number between 12,000 and
22,000, roam the countryside almost at will and have caused
tremendous econonic damage.
   No government acknowledges assisting the rebels, who have been
accused of widespread civilian atrocities. <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> denies the
charges.
   The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. State Department</ORGANIZATION>, in a report released in <DATE>April</DATE>,
estimated the rebels killed 100,000 civilians in the past two to
three years.
   <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> this week announced a cease-fire during the pope's visit
and wished the pontiff a good stay. Still, <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> announced
extensive security measures for the pope and the pilgrims traveling
to see him at stops in <LOCATION>Nampula</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Beira</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION>, the capital.
   <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> receives most of its military assistance from the
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> but increasingly has been making overtures to Western
nations. The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is the largest donor of food aid in
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> has been providing military training.
   <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> also has been working to improve relations with
neighboring <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, which has backed <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> in the past.
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> says it stopped supporting the guerrillas under terms
of a <DATE>1984</DATE> mutual non-aggression pact, but <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> has continued
to accuse <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> of providing assistance.
   Mozambique regularly refers to <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> as the ``racist
regime,'' but on <DATE>Monday</DATE> Chissano hosted South African President
<PERSON>P.W. Botha</PERSON> on his first summit meeting in a black-ruled African
nation.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> has tried to prod the peace process in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> by
sending one of <PERSON>John Paul</PERSON>'s top cardinal aides to meet separately
with <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> and <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> in <DATE>July</DATE>. Also, some Mozambican bishops
reportedly have maintained contacts with <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>.
   Chissano met the pope in <DATE>May</DATE> in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>, but the Vactican appears
to be holding off the establishment of diplomatic relations as an
incentive to move the peace process ahead.
   In <LOCATION>Mbabane</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION>, earlier <DATE>Friday</DATE>, the pope preached about
the virtues of monogamy at a Mass attended by <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION>'s
20-year-old king and his four wives.
   King <PERSON>Mswati III</PERSON>, the world's youngest monarch, sat
expressionless as the pope told a crowd of 10,000 at the capital's
national stadium that God intended each husband to have one wife.
   The pope, who arrived at the stadium in his popemobile escorted
by spear-carrying warriors, spoke from an altar topped by a turret
manned by a soldier with a rifle and binoculars.

  [Text] Speaking in <LOCATION>Tete Province</LOCATION> yesterday, President of 
the Republic <PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON> announced that the government has 
decided to temporarily suspend its troop demobilization process. 
As a reason for such a decision, the Mozambican head of state 
said that the <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique National Resistance</ORGANIZATION>'s [<ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>] troop 
demobilization process had not been balanced. He also noted the 
need for making technical corrections to the figures and lists 
that <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> has been supplying to the <ORGANIZATION>UN Operations</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> Technical Unit. 
  NOTICIAS reports that President <PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON> made that 
announcement after visiting the troop assembly area in <LOCATION>Ulongwe</LOCATION>, 
the capital of <ORGANIZATION>Tete Province</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Angonia District</ORGANIZATION>. NOTICIAS also 
reports that the Mozambican head of state warned the soldiers of 
the need for them to remain in the area for a while longer. He 
explained that it is an area that continues to deserve special 
attention. NOTICIAS says President <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> was indirectly 
referring to the fact that <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> soldiers continue to be 
powerfully armed and terrorizing the civilian population in many 
parts of <ORGANIZATION>Tete Province</ORGANIZATION>. 
  The president of the <ORGANIZATION>Republic</ORGANIZATION> traveled 260 km on the road 
between the city of <ORGANIZATION>Tete</ORGANIZATION>, the provincial capital, and <ORGANIZATION>Angonia 
District</ORGANIZATION>. He passed many areas where <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> continues to 
prevent the <ORGANIZATION>Mozambican Government</ORGANIZATION> from implementing the <ORGANIZATION>National 
Reconstruction Program</ORGANIZATION> and other political organizations from 
doing their political work. 
  NOTICIAS also reports today that a South African citizen was 
distributing photographs of <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON>Afonso Dhlakama</PERSON> in one 
of the areas visited by the Mozambican head on his way to 
<ORGANIZATION>Angonia District</ORGANIZATION>. That South African citizen had not been 
allowed to come into the country from <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION>, but was 
subsequently seen in Mozambican territory.

<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s President <PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON> said
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> his government is willing to start talks within several
weeks with the <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION> rebels on ending the country's 10-year civil
war.
   <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> said he was awaiting an answer from the rebels through
mediators who have been trying to bring the sides together. He
praised the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> for a seven-point proposal it presented
both sides last year to help them overcome their reluctance to
negotiate.
   ``We feel we can now go into talks,'' <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> told reporters at
a news conference summing up three days of talks with President
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, top officials of his administration and congressional leaders.
   ``If <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION> gives us a quick answer, we are ready to start,'' he
added. Negotiations could begin as soon as Chissano returns from
next week's ceremonies marking the independence of neighboring
<LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>, he said.
   RENAMO had been reluctant to accept one of the points that deals
with recognition of <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s government and its constitution,
<PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> said. But now, the rebels appear willing to recognize the
government and recognition of the constitution can be worked out
during the actual peace talks, he said.
   <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, which in recent years has renounced its Marxist
doctrine and shifted to a market-oriented economy, is drafting a
constitution that would allow independent candidates to run in
elections, he said. Individuals from <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION> would be eligible to
participate, <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> said.
   The people of <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> will also vote this <DATE>summer</DATE> on a
proposal to allow more than one political party. If that happens,
<ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION> could compete in elections, he said.
   <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> has been devastated by the fighting with <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION>,
founded in the <DATE>1970s</DATE> by white <LOCATION>South Africans</LOCATION> to counter the
government's support for the guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION>African National
Congress</ORGANIZATION>. The group has been accused by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials and human
rights monitors of savage attacks on innocent civilians.
   <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> said he was satisfied that the South African government
of <ORGANIZATION>F.W. de Klerk</ORGANIZATION> had stopped all assistance to <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION>. He said
South African authorities were cooperating with his government to
stop aid for the rebels from inidividuals in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. The
organization also has wealthy right-wing backers in <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>.
   While praising de Klerk for progress he has made toward starting
talks with his country's black majority about the future of
apartheid, <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> also urged the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to maintain its
economic sanctions against <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> ``until everyone is sure
the process is irreversible.''
   <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> said he had asked <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> for additional financial help to
rehabilitate his country and help an estimated 5.6 million refugees
and handicapped people. <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> receives more than <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY>
annually from the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, making it the largest aid
recipient in <LOCATION>sub-Saharan Africa</LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
   A decade ago, thousands of guerrillas
flooded across the border from <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> to mount a final assault
against the white-minority government in what then was call
<LOCATION>Rhodesia</LOCATION>.
   Today, eight years after <LOCATION>Rhodesia</LOCATION> became black-governed
<LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>, battalions of troops, including guerrilla veterans of
that independence war, are strung along the same border _ this time
to block a new wave of incursions by guerrillas fighting to
overthrow <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s government.
   The outcome of the guerrillas' strikes in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> and inside
<LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> will have a major impact on the fragile economies of the
troubled region in southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>.
   Several black-ruled states are striving to divert their trade
traffic from <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Indian Ocean</LOCATION> ports in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, a
former Portuguese colony, in a bid to loosen their economic
dependency on the <LOCATION>South Africans</LOCATION>.
   The rebels, in turn, vow to continue sabotaging <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s
supply lines that also serve <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Zaire</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Zambia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>.
   So far, the 12,000 to 20,000 guerrillas of the anti-government
<ORGANIZATION>Mozambique National Resistance</ORGANIZATION> seem unharried by the conventional
forces ranged against them in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> _ some 30,000
Mozambican regulars, more than 12,000 Zimbabweans, 2,000 Tanzanians
and a few hundred Malawians.
   The guerrillas, who call themselves nationalists opposing a
Marxist-based government, roam <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s 10 provinces and mount
frequent raids into <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> with virtual impunity.
   ``It's very strange being on the other side,'' said a young
Zimbabwean corporal who fought the Rhodesians under the name
<ORGANIZATION>Comrade Hammer</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We know from our experience it's hard to beat guerrillas. But
these people are just bandits and at least we know exactly how they
think and what they might do next.''
   The guerrillas, known by the Portuguese acronym <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION>,
originally were formed by the Rhodesian intelligence service in
<DATE>1977</DATE>, two years after <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>, to
harass nationalist guerrillas directed by <PERSON>Robert Mugabe</PERSON> from inside
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> during <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>'s 1973-79 independence war.
   Mugabe became <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>'s prime minister at independence from
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in <DATE>April 1980</DATE> and cut support to the Mozambican rebels. But
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> took over the reins until <DATE>1984</DATE> when it signed a
non-aggression pact with <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>. Since then, <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> claims
South African support has continued, a charge denied by the South
African government.
   The Mozambican rebels declared war on <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> <DATE>last year</DATE> after
<PERSON>Mugabe</PERSON> vowed that a quarter of his forces stationed in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>
would fight to keep its government in power.
   Since then they have stepped up raids along the 750-mile
frontier of forested mountains and scrub-dotted plains.
   Rebels have killed scores of villagers and some security-force
militias. They have abducted hundreds of civilians, including
children, and marched them at gunpoint into <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, apparently
as dragooned recruits.
   They also have destroyed government schools, clinics and
development projects; robbed country stores and remote homesteads
of food, drink and clothing; ambushed buses and looted passengers;
ordered workers to leave forestry estates, coffee plantations and
orchards; rustled cattle, sheep and goats.
   <PERSON>Mugabe</PERSON> has exhorted his troops ``to erect an impassable defense
along our border'' to prevent fresh incursions.
   He also urged them to renew military efforts inside <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>
``to completely deny the enemy any ... chance to sabotage our
arteries to the sea.''
   Lt. Col. <PERSON>Solomon Mujuru</PERSON>, a wartime guerrilla chieftain and now
<LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>'s army commander, called on civilians living along the
frontier to report people they suspect might have links to the
guerrillas.
   But <PERSON>Mujuru</PERSON> said Zimbabwean troops had gained the upper hand in
counterinsurgency operations since the first major incursions eight
months ago.
   Before <DATE>June</DATE>, <PERSON>Mujuru</PERSON>'s soldiers and the rebels clashed only in
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>.
   Since then, troops of <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>'s new 5,000-member 6th Brigade
have reinforced border defenses, militias are guarding farms,
villages, schools and clinics and cross-border movement has been
banned except at established immigration posts.
   Anti-personnel mines have been sown where guerrillas are thought
to cross into <PERSON>Zimbabwqe</PERSON> and the identification papers of some
65,000 Mozambican refugees in three camps are being screened by
local authorities and the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations High Commission</ORGANIZATION> for
Refugees.
   In addition, courts have cracked down on local peasants
suspected of links to the insurgents. Early in <DATE>February</DATE>, a <LOCATION>Mutare</LOCATION>
judge sent a woman to prison for six years and a man for five years
for failing to report the presence of bandits to officials.
   At stake in the conflict is not only the survival of <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>,
its economy already in ruins as a result of fighting and famine.
   Also at issue is the fate of the so-called <LOCATION>Beira Corridor</LOCATION>, a
186-mile trade route that meanders through mountains, fertile
valleys and swamps from the Zimbabwean border city to the <LOCATION>Indian
Ocean</LOCATION> port of <LOCATION>Beira</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>.
   A fifth of the overseas trade of the black-ruled neighbor states
flows along the corridor's railroads and highways. Landlocked
<LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> receives most of its fuel suppliers from a corridor
pipeline despite repeated sabotage by the guerrillas. Most of that
trade and oil previously went through <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   Both <PERSON>Mugabe</PERSON> and President <PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> have
rejected suggestions that they hold peace talks with the
guerrillas, arguing that the rebels are puppets of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s
government and have no support from either the East or the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>.
   Mugabe, at the graduation ceremony for the 6th Brigade in
<DATE>September</DATE>, said he was forced to form the unit because of what he
called South African destabilization in the region.
   ``<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s subversion of <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s ... sovereignity had
the potential to completely deny us any routes to the sea,'' <PERSON>Mugabe</PERSON>
said.
   ``The survival of <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> is our survival,'' <PERSON>Mugabe</PERSON> said.
``The fall of <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> certainly also will be our <DATE>fall</DATE>.''

<HEAD>Mozambique, Rebels Postpone Direct Peace Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first direct peace talks between
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s government and right-wing rebels have been postponed.
   A communique <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> by officials of <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s leftist
government and mediating countries said the talks did not begin as
scheduled <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION>, which borders the troubled southeast
African nation.
   The discussions were to include Mozambican Cabinet ministers and
<PERSON>Alfonso Dhlakama</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique National Resistance</ORGANIZATION>
guerrilla army, known by its Portuguese acronym <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>.
   The communique said without elaboration that the talks were
postponed because of ``difficulties experienced by the <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> delegations.''
   ``Efforts are continuing to set a new date in the near future
for the process to begin in <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION>,'' said the statement, published
by the official <ORGANIZATION>Malawi News Agency</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Mana</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> has been fighting for control of the territory for 13
years and opposes the one-party rule of President <PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON>.
The war has left hundreds of thousands of people dead, mostly
civilians.
   The <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> national news agency, AIM, had reported from
<LOCATION>Blantyre</LOCATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that Mozambican Cabinet ministers and the
leader of the guerrillas had gathered in the city for the talks.
But <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> did not sign <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s communique. The host government
for several days declined to grant visas for Western correspondents
seeking to report on the meeting.
   <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> has opposed <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION> as a venue, favoring either <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> or
<LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s former colonial ruler that granted
independence in <DATE>1975</DATE>.
   Malawian officials, contacted by telephone from the Zimbabwean
capital, <LOCATION>Harare</LOCATION>, said they were not authorized to discuss the
aborted meeting beyond what was published in the communique.
   The <LOCATION>Blantyre</LOCATION> talks were expected to focus on President
<PERSON>Chissano</PERSON>'s proposals for a new constitution to allow independents
to oppose the ruling Front for the Liberation of <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> at
elections.
   But <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> has rejected demands for the creation of opposition
parties.
   <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> have for several months brokered low-level
peace talks.

<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, trying his hand at African
peacemaking, called today for early negotiations to end
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s 10-year civil war.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> issued the plea after talks with <PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON>, the
president of the former Marxist state.
   At a departure ceremony after talks in the <ORGANIZATION>Oval Office</ORGANIZATION> and over
lunch, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON>'s government has taken ``significant
steps to heal divisions which threaten your nation. And we urge all
parties to talk at the earliest opportunity so as to avoid further
suffering.''
   He praised <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> for strengthing ties with the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>
and adopting reforms on voting, property rights and religious
freedoms, but said more needs to be done.
   ``We look forward to even further reforms,'' the president said.
``So we talked today of common concerns like refugee issues and
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s humanitarian concerns _ the crisis in humanitarian
concerns, I might add.''
   <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> said he assured <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> that his government was ready to
enter into direct talks with rebel forces as soon as possible. He
also said he expressed appreciation ``for the stand the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> has taken on the war in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> and for the positive role
it has been playing in the peace process.''
   Chissano appeared taken aback by the crush of television cameras
on hand to witness the start of his <ORGANIZATION>Oval Office</ORGANIZATION> visit.
   As the crews pushed their long boom microphones toward his face,
<PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> asked, ``What do you do with all these photos? It's too
many.''
   The media people were ushered out as <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON>, seated
in wingback chairs by the fireplace, began their talks in private.
   A <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> official who briefed reporters about today's visit said
the government of <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION> rebels were nearing
agreement on starting peace talks.
   ``I believe they're in a pre-negotiating stage right now to
determine the framework for their talks. And we're hoping that they
will take the final step to get together,'' said the official, who
spoke <DATE>Monday</DATE> on condition of anonymity.
   RENAMO, an organization vilified by human rights groups for its
brutality in the civil war, has been demanding that the <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>
government abandon Marxism-Leninism and establish a multiparty
system.
   <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, which gained independence from <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> in <DATE>1975</DATE>, has
dropped its Marxist ideology and turned to private enterprise and a
free-market economy in recent years. As a reward, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> recently
struck the country from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> list of Marxist states, opening
the way for lending and trade concessions.
   ``It is our belief that because so many of <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION>'s demands have
been met already, it should not be too difficult to enter into a
negotiated settlement in the near future,'' said the official.
   Attempts at getting the two sides to stop their war began last
year, with the presidents of <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> mediating.
Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON>Herman Cohen</PERSON> and other <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials
also have been trying to help.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> reportedly has a seven-point plan that would
meet both sides' preconditions for talks.
   ``We have been acting as a facilitator. And we will be wanting
to consult with President <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> at this time to see what more we
can do to help the start of direct negotiations,'' said the
official.
   The war has been a costly one. An estimated 3.2 million
Mozambicans have been driven from their homes, either to internal
or external exile. The international community has had to give
Mozambique <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> to buy food every year.
   Created originally by the white South African government to
counter the Mozambican government's support for the <ORGANIZATION>African
National Congress</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION> has in recent months lost much of its
ideological and financial support.
   When President <ORGANIZATION>F.W. de Klerk</ORGANIZATION> came to power in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> <DATE>last
year</DATE>, he stopped assistance to <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION>. He since has dropped the ban
on <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> and has made overtures to its leadership designed to lead to
talks about the future of the apartheid racial discrimination
system.
   RENAMO still gets money from sympathizers in <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
   Marxist <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> has decided for the
first time to allow talks with right-wing rebels in a bid to bring
peace to the former Portuguese colony, a church leader said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   The Rev. <PERSON>Filipe Sigue Banze</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique United Methodist
Church</ORGANIZATION> told reporters that a mediation committee of church leaders
has been set up with the blessing of the <LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION> government to
contact the <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique National Resistance</ORGANIZATION>.
   The resistance group, also known by its Portuguese acronym
<ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION>, has been blamed for widespread atrocities, making hundreds
of thousands of people homeless and forcing tens of thousands more
into exile.
   Guerrillas who have been fighting for control of the southeast
African territory for a decade, control most of the countryside and
make it dangerous for civilians to venture out of the capital,
<LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION>.
   ``The government believes that since the churches represent many
of the people it is for the churches to establish dialogue with the
destabilizers of the region,'' <PERSON>Banze</PERSON> told a news conference.
   There was no immediate comment from the <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> government.
Until now, President <PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON>'s government had refused to
allow any dialogue with the rebels, arguing they are terrorists on
the payroll of neighboring <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   In recent talks with <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON>, South African President <PERSON>P.W. Botha</PERSON>
pledged that all support for the rebels had stopped.
   Banze said the Peace and <ORGANIZATION>Reconciliation Committee</ORGANIZATION> was established
by the 17-member <ORGANIZATION>General Christian Council of Mozambique</ORGANIZATION> under the
leadership of Anglican Bishop <PERSON>Denis Sengulane</PERSON>.
   Committee members first met Chissano in <DATE>August</DATE> and got specific
instructions to seek direct talks with the rebels, he said.
   ``We the leaders of the church believe we can carry out that
role,'' <PERSON>Banze</PERSON> said. The first problem is finding the leaders, who
are scattered throughout <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, he said.
   Banze said the committee hoped to report progress in peace
efforts at a meeting with <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> next month.
   ``We do not know what the atmosphere will be like,'' the cleric
said. ``If it is favorable on the one side we will then speak to the
other side. We have to take it as it comes.''
   Ultimately, <PERSON>Banze</PERSON> said, the committee hoped to get the government
and the guerrillas to talk to each other.
   Banze was among 150 church leaders and human rights activists at
a five-day <ORGANIZATION>World Council of Churches</ORGANIZATION> conference in <LOCATION>Harare</LOCATION> on South
African destabilization in the region.
   The guerrrila group was created by the intelligence services of
the Rhodesian government in <DATE>1977</DATE> to harass black nationalist
guerrillas who used <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> as a launching pad for offensives
into <LOCATION>Rhodesia</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>General Christian Council of Mozambique</ORGANIZATION> does not include the
<ORGANIZATION>Roman Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION>, the largest Christian denomination in the
country with about 2 million adherents out of the 15 million people.
Half of Mozambicans adhere to traditional animist beliefs and about
<PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> are Moslem.

   Negotiators for <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s leftist government and
the nation's rebels held their first direct peace talks this week
and said <DATE>today</DATE> they would try to end the 13-year-old insurgency.
   The talks, involving the rebels' No. 2 leader and a government
minister, could lead to a cease-fire by the end of the year, said
<PERSON>Mario Raffaelli</PERSON>, a parliamentary deputy who monitored the talks for
the Italian government.
   Both sides met <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <DATE>Monday</DATE> and <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> at the <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>
headquarters of <ORGANIZATION>San Egidio Community</ORGANIZATION>, a religious organization that
aids poor immigrants in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, and which also observed the talks.
   The negotiations were not announced ahead of time and were held
privately.
   An estimated 600,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in the
war in the southeast African nation. The rebels have been accused
of widespread civilian atrocities by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. State Department</ORGANIZATION> and
others.
   The war has left <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> one of the poorest countries in the
world. Annual per capita income is about <MONEY>$200</MONEY> and almost half the
15 million people require some level of food aid.
   Leading the Mozambican government delegation in the talks was
<PERSON>Armando Gebuza</PERSON>, minister of transport and communication. Raul
Domingos, No. 2 official for <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION>, as the rebels are known,
headed the other delegation.
   ``We could be optimistic'' about the possibility for a
cease-fire, <PERSON>Raffaelli</PERSON> said. ``I think it's realistic that there
could be one by the end of this year, maybe in time for
Christmas,'' said <PERSON>Raffaelli</PERSON>, a Socialist who formerly was the
<ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION>'s undersecretary for <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Raffaelli</PERSON> said both sides would meet again in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> ``as soon as
possible,'' probably within several weeks.
   RENAMO, the Portuguese acronym for the <ORGANIZATION>Mozambican National
Resistance</ORGANIZATION>, has been fighting a war against the government of the
country, which gained independence from <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> in <DATE>1975</DATE>.
   ``Keeping in mind the greater interests of the Mozambican
nation, both sides have agreed on the necessity to put aside that
which divides them, and to concentrate, with priority, their
attention on that which unites them, toward creating a common
working base to realize, in a spirit of mutual comprehension, a
dialogue within which they can debate their different points of
view,'' said a communique signed by the two sides and released
<DATE>today</DATE>.
   Both sides said they were ready to commit themselves toward
``the search for a working platform to end the war and to create
political, economic and social conditions that will allow a lasting
peace and the normalization of life of all Mozambican citizens.''
   Before the peace talks this week, efforts by <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>
had failed to get both sides to the negotiation table.
   <PERSON>Raffaelli</PERSON> said both sides agreed a month ago to have the talks
held in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> was informed about the peace efforts but
was not directly involved, officials at the news conference said.
   Pope <PERSON>John Paul II</PERSON> visited <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> in <DATE>September 1988</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION> says its wants recognition as a political party and free
elections, but its political program has never been clear. No
government publicly supports the rebels, although <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>
openly backed them until it signed a mutual non-aggression pact
with <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> in <DATE>1984</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION>Frelimo Party</ORGANIZATION> dropped its Marxist label last
year and has been liberalizing the economy and politics. The
government of President <PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON> is working toward a more
market-oriented economy and is considering a constitution that
would allow independents to run for parliament. however, it has not
come out in favor of allowing opposition parties.
   The Mozambican government still receives most of its weapons
from the Soviets, but it has developed increasingly close ties with
Western countries.
   Britain helps train government troops and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is
the leading food donor to <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON> has
announced that, for the first time in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s history,
opposition parties will be allowed to compete for power.
   The move, reported <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by the national news agency AIM, was
considered a major concession that could help end the nation's
13-year-old civil war.
   The conflict has claimed about 100,000 lives, most of them
civilians.
   ``For those who want to form parties, as long as they obey the
law, as long as they behave peacefully, we have no right to prevent
them from doing so,'' AIM quoted <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> quoted as saying.
   <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> said the political bureau of the ruling <ORGANIZATION>FRELIMO</ORGANIZATION> party
had voted unanimously to adopt a multiparty system and that it
should be in place for parliamentary and presidential elections
next year.
   FRELIMO has ruled <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> as the sole legal political party
since independence from <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> in <DATE>1975</DATE>. The party was Marxist,
but has undergone reforms in recent years and officially dropped
its Marxist label last year.
   Rebels of the <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique National Resistance</ORGANIZATION> began their
insurgency in <DATE>1977</DATE>, and the war has made this southeast African
nation one of the poorest countries in the world.
   Almost half of <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s 15 million people require food aid.
More than 1 million people have been displaced, and the annual per
capita income is under <MONEY>$200</MONEY>.
   The rebels, known by their Portuguese acronym, <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION>, demand a
multiparty system and free elections.
   The government and rebels held their first direct talks three
weeks ago in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>. No major breakthroughs emerged, but more talks
are considered likely.
   Asked if <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION> could become a legal political party, <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON>
said, ``I don't imagine that <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION> will have any difficulty in
fulfilling the criteria.
   ``RENAMO knows the country, they have people in all the
provinces and districts. They have the possibility of creating a
base, though how big it would be, I don't know.''
   The rebels have no clear political program. They have devastated
the country with hit-and-run attacks and have been accused of
widespread civilian atrocities by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. State Department</ORGANIZATION> and
others.
   The government controls the major cities, but the rebels are
active throughout the country in rural areas.
   No government acknowledges supporting the rebels, although <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION> openly backed them before signing a <DATE>1984</DATE> mutual
non-aggression pact with <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> still receives most of its military help from the
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>. But the government has developed close ties with the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and other Western countries in recent years.
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> helps train the army and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is the
leading donor of food aid.

<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>Joachim Chissano</PERSON> blamed
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> for <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s devastating civil war but sent an
emissary on a goodwill mission to the white-ruled nation, raising
the possibility of a summit meeting.
   Chissano spoke harshly of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> at the opening of a
conference convened <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by his Marxist-oriented government and
the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> to address <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s emergency relief needs
for the coming year.
   <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> says 6 million of its 14.5 million people need
emergency food aid. It has appealed for 900 million tons of donated
food, as well as other assistance, with a total cost of <MONEY>$380
million</MONEY>.
   <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> attributes most of its problems to the insurgency
waged since <DATE>1977</DATE> by the <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique National Resistance</ORGANIZATION>, which it
says is backed by <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> in violation of a <DATE>1984</DATE>
non-aggression treaty.
   But as the conference began, <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> dispatched Cooperation
Minister <PERSON>Jacinto Veloso</PERSON> with a conciliatory message for South
African President <PERSON>P.W. Botha</PERSON>. <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> said
<PERSON>Veloso</PERSON> met with <PERSON>Botha</PERSON>, conveyed <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON>'s interest in improving
relations and discussed a possible summit meeting between the two
leaders.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Foriegn Ministry</ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> as offering to promote
regional development and saying the two countries should stop
accusing each other of breaching the <DATE>1984</DATE> non-aggression accord.
   In the treaty, <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> pledged to halt
assistance to insurgents fighting the other country's government.
   There is widespread international support for <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s claim
that South African security forces continue to provide logistical
aid to the Mozambican rebels despite the treaty.
   The conference in <LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION> was attended by about 200 delegates
from <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> agencies, relief organizations and foreign governments.
   A <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> delegate, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON>Roy Stacey</PERSON>,
accused the Mozambican rebels of ``one of the most brutal
holocausts against ordinary human beings since World War II.''
   <PERSON>Stacey</PERSON> said the rebels' supporters, ``wherever they may be,
cannot wash the blood from their hands unless all support for this
unconscionable violence is stopped immediately.'' Without
specifying figures, he said the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> intended to make
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> its largest aid recipient in <LOCATION>sub-Saharan Africa</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON>Javier Perez de Cuellar</PERSON>, in a message to
the conference, said <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> ``remains the target of externally
supported acts of destabilization.''
   ``This continued reign of terror has increasingly involved
random and brutal killings, pillaging of the population, wide-scale
destruction and sabotage,'' he said.
   In his speech, <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> said <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> was engaged in a
``criminal and irresponsible'' strategy to weaken black-ruled
southern African states.
   He said the rebel movement ``has its command in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>,
where it receives all kinds of aid.''
   A Swedish official, <PERSON>Sten Rylander</PERSON>, urged the international
community to provide security assistance, as well as emergency aid,
in order to protect relief projects.
   Despite the strains between <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, there
have been signs of increasing cooperation.
   The two governments have engaged in negotiations aimed at
rehabilitating a major hydroelectric project in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> that has
been frequently targeted by rebel saboteurs.
   On <DATE>Monday</DATE>, the chairman of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s largest conglomerate
held talks with <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> and other Mozambican officials in <LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION>
on the possible involvement of <ORGANIZATION>Anglo American Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in developing
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s natural resources. <ORGANIZATION>Anglo</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, <PERSON>Gavin Relly</PERSON>, said
his company might be interested in forestry, agriculture and
natural gas projects.

Mozambique and Its People: Pawns in a Brutal Struggle
---
By Alexander Cockburn</HL>
<DD> 12/24/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<IN> AFRIC </IN>
<TEXT>
   Of all the horror stories in the world this year, one of the most appalling is that of <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>. 
Four and a half million people, one-third of the population, are near starvation; 100,000 have died of malnutrition. 
Infant mortality is among the highest in the world: 375 out of every 1,000 children die before the age of five. 
Clinics, schools, farms and factories have been destroyed throughout most of the country. 
Water and electricity services are usually disrupted; gasoline is scarce, as are transport vehicles. 

   Massacres are not uncommon. 
Women and children have been hacked to death with machetes or burned alive in buses; 424 Mozambicans were slaughtered in the village of Homoine on <DATE>July 19</DATE>; 92 in <LOCATION>Manjacaze</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE>; 51 in <LOCATION>Taninga</LOCATION> on <DATE>Oct. 18</DATE>. 
Refugees from the rural areas have fled to the capital, <LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION>, or to neighboring countries. 

   All of these devastations are a result of the decade-long war between <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Frelimo</ORGANIZATION> government and the mercenary force known as <ORGANIZATION>MNR</ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>. 
After 400 years of Portuguese rule, <ORGANIZATION>Frelimo</ORGANIZATION> won independence for <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> in <DATE>1975</DATE>. 
A year later, Portuguese colonists and Rhodesian intelligence agents, angry that <ORGANIZATION>Frelimo</ORGANIZATION> was supporting guerrillas based in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> and seeking to overthrow the white-settler regime in neighboring <LOCATION>Rhodesia</LOCATION>, created <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Though unsuccessful at blocking independence in <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>, these forces did not abandon their goal of destabilizing both it and <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>. 
Since the death of Mozambican leader <PERSON>Samora Machel</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> has formally declared war on <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> and increasingly carries out brutal attacks on villages there. 
Last <DATE>June</DATE>, 11 villagers were killed at <LOCATION>Kgodora</LOCATION> near <LOCATION>Rushinga</LOCATION>, about 12 miles inside <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>. 
In <DATE>October</DATE>, 13 peasants were killed with machetes at Chiredzi in southeastern <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>. 
On <DATE>Nov. 19</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> atacked a school on a tea plantation near <LOCATION>Chipinga</LOCATION>, killing five children, cutting ears and noses off nine others and abducting 20. 

   In <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> the war is severely undermining the economy. 
The national debt stands at <MONEY>$4 billion</MONEY>, and the cost of supporting the war equals that. 
Production is crippled and there is a trade deficit of <MONEY>$447.8 million</MONEY>. 
Under such circumstances <ORGANIZATION>Frelimo</ORGANIZATION>'s economic-recovery program has little chance of succeeding. 
Prime Minister <PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON> has appealed to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and other EEC members for humanitarian aid and has called on neighboring countries for assistance. 

   Meanwhile, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> continues to supply <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>, as it has since <DATE>1980</DATE>, when <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> gained independence. 
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> perceives the political dislocation and economic dependency of its neighbors as vital to the preservation of apartheid and its own internal security. 
The familiar rationale that these nations pose a communist threat in the region is used to prolong this war of carnage. 

   Right-wing politicians in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> -- inter alios <PERSON>Jesse Helms</PERSON>, <PERSON>Robert Dole</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jack Kemp</PERSON> -- and organizations such as the <ORGANIZATION>Heritage Foundation</ORGANIZATION> and Free the <LOCATION>Eagle</LOCATION>, are also drumming up support for <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>'s murderers, again with the claim that <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> is a Soviet colony. 
Of course, visitors to <LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION> see no evidence of a Soviet presence: no battleships in the harbor, no soldiers in uniform. 
The right wing might as well be worried about a Scandinavian takeover of <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>. 
Countries from that region and elsewhere in the West send humanitarian aid and relief workers to minister to the victims of South African-backed violence. 
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> has sent military officers and advisers to train the armed forces of <ORGANIZATION>Frelimo</ORGANIZATION>. 

   In an attempt to recover from a devastating series of natural disasters and to stop <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s support for <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Machel</ORGANIZATION> signed a nonaggression pact with <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> in <DATE>1984</DATE>, the <LOCATION>Nkomati Accord</LOCATION>. 
He agreed to remove <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> bases from <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> in return for <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s abandonment of <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>. 
Machel carried out his part of the bargain; <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> did not. 
And justified repugnance at this flouting of an accord has no doubt fueled suspicions, persisting through several investigations, that the <LOCATION>South Africans</LOCATION> did after all have a hand in the air crash that killed <PERSON>Machel</PERSON>. 

   When Zimbabwean/Mozambican forces overran a <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> base in <LOCATION>Gorongosa</LOCATION>, they found documents detailing the collaboration of South African military officers and government ministers with the <ORGANIZATION>MNR</ORGANIZATION>. Witnesses to massacres and escaped prisoners of the mercenaries report seeing South African supplies and military equipment. 
Guns with serial numbers obscured and bullets traceable to <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s military have been captured. 
Numerous sightings of South African-marked aircraft -- e.g., near the <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION> border when <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> seized the town of Milanje in <LOCATION>Zambezia Province</LOCATION> in <DATE>September 1986</DATE> -- have been logged. 

   The <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration has acted with caution in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, although it is under steady pressure from the fanatic ultraright to provide military assistance to <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>. 
The confirmation of <PERSON>Melissa Wells</PERSON>, the new <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, was opposed by <PERSON>Sen. Helms</PERSON> and others on the issue of whether she would accept the role of mediator between <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Frelimo</ORGANIZATION>. 
Furthermore, considerable propaganda aimed at magically transforming <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> from an army of mercenaries into "freedom fighters" or "a popular resistance movement" continues to flow from the offices of various senators and congresspersons. 
Very little, if any, reliable information on <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> finds its way into the mainstream press. 

   There are two stories in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>: extreme human suffering and the country's strategic political and economic importance to South African hegemony in the region. 
Mozambicans are among the poorest people in the world. 
Thousands live in abandoned railroad cars, and these are the lucky ones. 
According to some who were captured by <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> and have escaped, many soldiers in the <ORGANIZATION>MNR</ORGANIZATION> are peasants, often children, who have been given a choice, fight or die. 
There are rumors that Mozambican miners in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> are presented with the same choice. 
They are then trained in military camps inside <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and sent back to form the <ORGANIZATION>MNR</ORGANIZATION> cadres. 

   Prime Minister <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON>, aware of the way in which men and boys are conscripted into the bandit ranks, is now proposing an amnesty for those who want to lay down their arms. 
These people have been pawns in a much wider struggle; not that of some imagined East-West confrontation, but the prolonged struggle of colonization, liberation and recolonization that makes such strange allies of <PERSON>Thatcher</PERSON> and <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON>, or <PERSON>Jonas Savimbi</PERSON> and South African general <PERSON>Magnus Malan</PERSON>. 

   <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> is hanging on to apartheid by a fascistic military and police apparatus. 
Its leaders are not really afraid of being slaughtered by black communists but of losing economic and political power over an enormously rich region. 
Their tactics are spelled out in the language of starvation, mutilation and economic destruction inflicted on <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>. 
That the American right and politicians such as <PERSON>Robert Dole</PERSON> should applaud the agents of these horrors is perhaps the most squalid of all the conservative "crusades" available to us at this season.

   Presidents <PERSON>Robert Mugabe</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> and
<PERSON>Daniel arap Moi</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> are set to meet <DATE>Monday</DATE> for talks aimed at
ending the 12-year-old civil war in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>.
   About 100,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in the
war, which has made refugees of another 1.6 million people and
ruined the economy of the southern African nation.
   <PERSON>Mugabe</PERSON> and Moi are expected to confer with <PERSON>Afonso Dhlakama</PERSON>,
leader of the rebel <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique National Resistance</ORGANIZATION>, and Mozambican
church leaders representing the government.
   The rebel and government delegations are not expected to meet,
but to exchange proposals through the mediating presidents.
   Mugabe on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> announced the visit to ``compare notes'' with
Moi after he met in the Zimbabwean capital of <LOCATION>Harare</LOCATION> with President
<PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>. Details of their discussions were
not released.
   Last month, <PERSON>Mugabe</PERSON> said <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> asked him to join Moi in trying
to negotiate an end to the war.
   The <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> government representatives _ Roman Catholic and
Protestant members of the <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique Christian Council</ORGANIZATION> _ reportedly
are carrying a 12-point peace plan from <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON>, but details have
not been made public.
   Dhlakama and the church delegation arrived in <LOCATION>Nairobi</LOCATION> late last
week. They originally were to meet in <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>'s capital <DATE>last month</DATE>,
but <PERSON>Dhlakama</PERSON> failed to arrive.
   The rebels initially rejected the mediation of <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>, which
has about 12,000 soldiers fighting alongside Mozambican government
forces to protect rail links and an oil pipeline from the <LOCATION>Indian
Ocean</LOCATION>.
   The rebels formerly were backed by the white-ruled government
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> in their fight to oust the <LOCATION>Marxist Maputo</LOCATION> government.
But they no longer have open support from any government and are
widely accused of atrocities against civilians.

THE biggest effort yet to solve poverty-stricken <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s 16-year civil
war gets under way in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> today where President <PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON> is due to
meet his rebel opponent for the first face-to-face peace talks.
Observers say there is a new-found sense of realism on both sides at the
talks, born of a recognition that <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> and its 15m people simply
cannot take another year of fighting, famine and destruction.
The success of the talks is critical to averting widespread starvation
caused by the worst drought in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s history but exacerbated by the
war which has made 70 per cent of the country insecure, and has forced at
least 4m people to flee their homes.
The outcome of the talks is also vital to efforts to resuscitate
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s aid-dependent economy where average per capita income is less
than Dollars 80 and where <PERSON>Mr Chissano</PERSON> says half the country's people cannot
feed themselves.
Hopes are high that after two years of failed talks, the warring sides,
tired by fighting and the suffering inflicted on their people, may now be
prepared to reach agreement. The optimism is boosted by the involvement in
the talks of President <PERSON>Mugabe</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> and the foreign ministers of <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>.
A critical role is also being played behind the scenes by the <ORGANIZATION>European
Community</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Mr Tiny Rowland</PERSON>, the chief executive of
<ORGANIZATION>Lonrho</ORGANIZATION>, which has substantial but unfulfilled agro-industrial commercial
interests in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>.
However, the same nagging obstacles which have defeated eleven rounds of
peace talks held over the past two years remain as formidable as ever.
<ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>, the right-wing rebel group led by <PERSON>Mr Afonso Dhlakama</PERSON>, has little in
the way of a political programme to present as a basis of dialogue. It was
originally formed and supported by the Rhodesian secret service in <DATE>1974</DATE> to
combat the communist black nationalist <ORGANIZATION>Frelimo</ORGANIZATION> party, which swept to power
in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> <DATE>a year later</DATE>.
After Zimbabwean independence in <DATE>1980</DATE>, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> continued the military
and logistical support of <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> as part of its destabilisation and sabotage
campaign in hostile neighbouring states. Throughout this period, <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>
never tried to build a mass popular base, like other rebel insurgencies, but
adopted tactics of sabotage and terrorism against civilians.
The end of the Cold War, the abandonment of communism by <ORGANIZATION>Frelimo</ORGANIZATION> and
introduction of liberal political and economic reforms followed by the
changes in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> have left <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> an anachronism. However, now backed
by right-wing extremists in <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, it has continued its
campaign of terror and destruction.
Fears are also widespread that one of the reasons <PERSON>Mr Dhlakama</PERSON> has been
reluctant to speed the peace process is that he may not exercise control
over his troops, many of whom are no more than marauding bandits.
Efforts to reach a successful ceasefire between the two sides as a prelude
to political dialogue has broken down over <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>'s demand that the <ORGANIZATION>Frelimo</ORGANIZATION>
government withdraw an estimated 5,000-7,000 Zimbabwean troops stationed in
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> to guard trade routes and an oil pipeline between the two
countries.

   President <PERSON>P.W. Botha</PERSON> of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>,
on his first summit-level mission into black <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, met <DATE>Monday</DATE>
with leaders of <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s Marxist government, which has blamed
much of its woes on <ORGANIZATION>Botha</ORGANIZATION>'s nation.
   President <PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> shook hands with <PERSON>Botha</PERSON>
at an airfield welcoming ceremony, then took him on a tour by jeep
of the nearby <LOCATION>Cahora Bassa</LOCATION> hydroelectric project before a two-hour
meeting.
   Afterward, <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> said he invited Chissano to visit <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>
and the two leaders issued a joint communique affirming their
support for regional cooperation. They said committees would be
formed to deal with issues such as trade, economic development and
migrant labor.
   <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> has signed an agreement to help rehabilitate the
<LOCATION>Cahora Bassa</LOCATION> project, in the northwestern province of Tete. The
power line leading to <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> from the dam near <LOCATION>Songo</LOCATION> has been
sabotaged repeatedly by guerrillas which <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> claims are
aided by <PERSON>Botha</PERSON>'s security forces.
   <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> said <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> gave assurances that <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> was not
helping the rebels.
   Botha was to go to <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION> later for talks <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> with President
<PERSON>Hastings Kamuzu Banda</PERSON>. <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION> is the only African state that has
full diplomatic ties with <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   Under apartheid, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s 5 million whites have
established a racially segregated society and the 26 million blacks
have no vote in national affairs.
   Botha and <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> were to discuss a mutual non-aggression
treaty signed by their countries in <DATE>1984</DATE>.
   The treaty lapsed in <DATE>1985</DATE> when <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> produced evidence that
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> violated the agreement by continuing to assist the
<ORGANIZATION>Mozambique National Resistance</ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION>. That guerrilla movement
began an insurgency two years after <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> won independence
from <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> in <DATE>1975</DATE>.
   The civil war, combined with drought, has left millions of
Mozambicans homeless and hungry.
   Many Western governments, including the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, have
increased aid to <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> and support its claim that the rebels
receive covert logistical and communications aid from <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> insists it no longer helps the rebels, and <PERSON>Botha</PERSON>
was expected to attempt to persuade Chissano to mute the
allegations.
   <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> was accompanied on his trip by his Defense Minister Gen.
<PERSON>Magnus Malan</PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON>Pik Botha</PERSON>. Chissano's delegation,
which left the capital of <LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION> for Songo early today, included
three Cabinet ministers and two military commanders, according to
the Mozambican news agency AIM.
   As part of an effort to improve its regional image, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>
has in the past year expanded its trade mission in <LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION> and
pursued economic development possibilities in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>.
   The two countries also have signed an agreement aimed at
rehabilitating the <LOCATION>Cahora Bassa</LOCATION> project in Tete so <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> can
purchase power.
   The rebels repeatedly have sabotaged power lines leading from
<LOCATION>Cahora Bassa</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   Even when their relations were badly strained, <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> maintained extensive ties. Tens of thousands of
Mozambicans work as miners and migrant laborers in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>,
and <LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION>'s electricity is supplied by <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   During his 10 years in power, <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> has had few chances to
travel in black <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. In <DATE>1986</DATE>, he was one of numerous dignitaries
who attended the coronation of <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>King Mswati III</PERSON>, and in
<DATE>1987</DATE> he made a secret visit to South African troops fighting in
<LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>.
   He had hoped to visit <LOCATION>Brazzaville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Congo</LOCATION>, earlier this year in
conjunction with peace talks on <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South-West Africa</LOCATION>, or
<LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>, but <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>'s Cuban allies reportedly threatened to scuttle
the talks if he came.

   In the gnarled branches of ancient
baobab trees hundreds of pelicans from <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> peacefully nest,
giving rise to a local joke that even the birds have fled the civil
war next door.
   During one of the incessant deluges that turn the rich farmland
into marshes this time of year, <PERSON>Manuel Thomo</PERSON> and his family, human
refugees from the war in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, huddled around a camp fire
beneath the branches of another baobab tree, a temporary home for
them and several other families.
   Rag-clad and diseased, hungry and frightened, more than 400,000
Mozambicans have crossed into neighboring <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION> in the past 17
months to escape fighting at home between guerrillas and the
government.
   The refugees have abandoned the poorest country in southern
<LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> for refuge in the region's second poorest nation.
   ``This is the major refugee problem in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> south of the
<LOCATION>Sahara</LOCATION>, excluding <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Somalia</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Raymond Mkanda</PERSON>, a
Tanzanian who heads the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations High Commission for Refugees</ORGANIZATION>
operation in <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION>.
   ``The pressure on the land is pretty heavy. <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION> doesn't have
adequate land for its own people and the refugees are occupying
land normally used for farming.''
   For generations, Mozambicans have been welcomed visitors across
the 1,000 miles of unguarded border they share with the Malawians.
   But fighting between government troops and the rebel <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique
National Resistance</ORGANIZATION>, more commonly known by the Portuguese acronym
<ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION>, have sent waves of Mozambicans fleeing into <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> gained independence from <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> in <DATE>1975</DATE> and has a
government based on Marxist theory.
   The refugees have put a strain on Malawian resources and caused
security problems.
   Drought last year has forced <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION>, once one of the <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>'s
few food exporters, to look elsewhere for food to feed its own
people.
   Increasingly, men suspected of being <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION> fighters have
crossed into <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION> to steal livestock and relief rations from the
refugees. A cattle stealing raid in <DATE>January</DATE> ended with the deaths
of three Malawian villagers who resisted the raiders, officials
said. They were the first Malawian casualties of the cross-border
intrusions, which also have cost the lives of several Mozambican
refugees.
   Landlocked <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION> is one of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>'s smallest and most densely
populated countries _ nearly 8 million people in the country about
the size of <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>U.N. High Commission</ORGANIZATION> for Refugees estimates the number of
Mozambican refugees in <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION> will reach a 500,000 by the end of
the year.
   ``Half a million refugees in a small country like <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION> is a
very big problem,'' said <PERSON>S.S. Kamvazina</PERSON>, principal secretary in the
<ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Health</ORGANIZATION> and the chairman of the joint committee
responsible for the refugees' care.
   An estimated 330,000 more Mozambican war refugees are in nearby
<LOCATION>Tanzania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Zambia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>, according
to the <ORGANIZATION>UNHCR</ORGANIZATION>.
   Most of the refugees arrive with similar stories of abuse from
both sides in the Mozambican conflict.
   Government troops accuse civilians of collaborating with the
rebels and take reprisals. RENAMO fighters, in turn, frequently
force villagers to carry supplies on long marches. The civilians
who falter or weaken are beaten or killed, some of the refugees
have charged.
   ``Some of the refugees take weeks wandering through the
countryside to avoid fighting,'' <PERSON>Mkanda</PERSON> said.
   For others, it's a short walk across an asphalt ribbon known as
M1, <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION>'s major north-south road connecting the capital,
<LOCATION>Lilongwe</LOCATION>, with <LOCATION>Blantyre</LOCATION>, the country's largest town.
   For 60 miles, M1 serves as the border between <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>.
   Lush fields of maize (corn) and other crops crowd both sides of
the road.
   But while mud huts dot the landscape on the Malawian side,
abandoned buildings and deserted huts line the Mozambican side.
   The former owners have fled, taking tin from the roofs and
windows from the buildings to use in build new homes on the <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION>
side of the road.
   During the day, some Mozambicans venture across the road to work
their old fields, but never too far inland to risk running into a
rebel or government patrol.
   Mozambicans living along M1 were among the first to flee the
fighting. That first mass movement, in <DATE>September 1986</DATE>, brought
40,000 refugees to <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION>. Three months later, the number had
nearly doubled and by <DATE>March 1987</DATE> it reached 100,000.
   Over the next 12 months the refugee population quadrupled.
   ``It's very difficult for the government to cope with the
problem,'' said <PERSON>Kamvanzina</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Health Ministry</ORGANIZATION> official. ``We get
no notice that tomorrow so many people are coming in.''
   More than 168,000 Mozambicans have settled here in the
southernmost district of <LOCATION>Nsanje</LOCATION>, the largest refugee concentration.
Refugees now outnumber the local population and the surrounding
mountainsides are being denuded by the newcomers who fell trees for
firewood and huts.
   Because of the influx _ as many as 100 a day _ it takes up to 10
days for officials to build even temporary shelter for the new
arrivals. Many of the refugees in the teeming camp near <LOCATION>Mangkokwe</LOCATION>
wear clothing fashioned from burlap sacks that once held their
rations.
   ``Those who are coming in now are in terrible condition _
malnutrition, no clothes, tuberculosis,'' said District
Commissioner <PERSON>Geoff Mwanja</PERSON>, the chief government officer for <LOCATION>Nsanje</LOCATION>.
``War has reduced human beings to beasts. If there was a way of
ending this thing, it would be very, very nice.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> refugee commission has budgeted <MONEY>$13 million</MONEY> for <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION>
in <DATE>1988</DATE> _ a ``seriously conservative figure,'' <PERSON>Mkanda</PERSON> said.
   International aid has started to pour in, including <MONEY>$1.2 million</MONEY>
from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Agency for <ORGANIZATION>Internationnal Development</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Repatriation is the most durable solution,'' <PERSON>Mkanda</PERSON> said.
   Nobody expects that soon.
   ``They might be here for some time _ five years, 10 years,''
<PERSON>Mkanda</PERSON> said. ``Even if there is change tomorrow in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, that
doesn't mean that everybody will leave.''

<TEXT>
   Pope <PERSON>John Paul II</PERSON>, his shoulders
draped with a leopard skin, on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> urged the Marxist government
and rebels to end their 12-year civil war and called for
international aid to rebuild the country.
   ``I felt the heart of the people bleed,'' the pope told Roman
Catholic bishops, criticized by the government for advocating
negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique National Resistance</ORGANIZATION> rebels.
   During the last full day of a 10-day trip through southern
<LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, the pope comforted victims whose limbs were blown off by
land mines, celebrated Mass at a soccer stadium decked with
political banners and was greeted by a boisterous crowd of 5,000
when he blessed an orphanage in a slum of reed huts.
   He met with anti-apartheid clergy leaders from neighboring <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION>, which <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s government has accused of aiding the
guerrilla insurgency. The civil war began shortly after <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>
gained independence from <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> in <DATE>1975</DATE>.
   ``With violence, nothing can be built and much is lost,'' he
said, urging citizens of this nation on the <LOCATION>Indian Ocean</LOCATION> coast of
southeastern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> to follow ``the path of dialogue and
reconciliation which will stop the spilling of blood among
brothers.''
   Addressing himself to the rebels, the pope said: ``Abandon the
paths of violence and vengeance. Put aside destructive action and
try to save what's left.''
   The government, he said, ``should make efforts in the sense of
building.''
   ``This nation needs assistance from other peoples and from the
international community,'' he said. ``Let me stress the urgency of
this solidarity, aimed at a quick, total pacification and immediate
aid grants to save a large amount of human lives.''
   The government accuses the guerrillas of massacres and
destruction of crops. The rebels deny such charges.
   Among the crowd of about 50,000 were the anti-apartheid church
leaders from <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, including the Rev. <PERSON>Allan Boesak</PERSON>,
president of the <ORGANIZATION>World Alliance of Reformed Churches</ORGANIZATION>, and the Rev.
<PERSON>Frank Chikane</PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION>South African Council of
Churches</ORGANIZATION>. They are leaders of a civil disobedience campaign
challenging emergency regulations and apartheid, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s
system of racial segregation.
   <PERSON>Boesak</PERSON> and <PERSON>Chikane</PERSON>, at a news conference following the meeting
with the pope, criticized <PERSON>John Paul</PERSON> for meeting with South African
authorities.
   Boesak suggested that the pope should have made more explicit
criticisms of apartheid during his 10-day tour of southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>,
which included an unscheduled stop in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> because of bad
weather in <LOCATION>Lesotho</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Boesak</PERSON> said the three-hour papal stop in <LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION> was a
propaganda coup for South African authorities, who had complained
previously about the omission of their country from the official
itinerary.
   <PERSON>Chikane</PERSON> said at the news conference that the pope had met with
officials who were ``persecuting us'' and had been escorted by
``people who torture us.''
   Banners at <ORGANIZATION>Machava Sports Stadium</ORGANIZATION> bore slogans such as
``Apartheid is the Nazism of our era'' and ``One does not negotiate
the motherland, one defends it.''
   During his homily, the pope said <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> should be afforded
``peace from the outside, of an ideological, military and economic
nature'' _ an apparent reference to <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, which has been
accused of using a variety of tactics to harrass <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>.
   The pope wore a leopard skin, a symbol of power to many
<LOCATION>Africans</LOCATION>. Most of the crowd at the stadium joined a 300-strong
choir in singing the hymn ``What a Friend We Have in Jesus' in the
<LOCATION>Tsonga</LOCATION> language, to the accompaniment of drums and hand-clapping.
   Gifts of ivory carvings, fruit and a brass chalice were carried
up a red-carpeted stairway to the altar. Children released balloons
and white doves, one of which alighted briefly on the head of a
white-robed priest.
   The pontiff, who returns to <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE>, has visited
<LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Lesotho</LOCATION> and made a brief,
unscheduled stop in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> when his plane was diverted in bad
weather.
   The war in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> has forced 2 million of the <MONEY>14.5 million</MONEY>
population to flee their homes and left millions more in need for
foreign food aid.
   <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> has been campaigning for more international relief
aid. Food and other supplies do not always reach the rural areas
where they are needed because of attacks by guerrillas and
transportation difficulties.
   <PERSON>John Paul</PERSON> offered <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> to patients at <ORGANIZATION>Maputo Central
Hospital</ORGANIZATION>, where he visited six wards before the <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>. He blessed
and gave <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> medals to amputees and other victims of guerrilla
attacks, and he kissed children lying in their beds.
   ``I suffer because you are suffering and it is not in my power
to cure you,'' the pope said.
   In <DATE>July</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> tried to encourage peace efforts in
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> by sending one of <PERSON>John Paul</PERSON>'s top aides to meet
separately with <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s President <PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON> and South
African President <PERSON>P.W. Botha</PERSON>.
   Chissano met the pope <DATE>last May</DATE> in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>, but the Vactican appears
to be holding off the establishment of diplomatic relations as an
incentive to advancing the peace process.
   About one-eighth of <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s people are Catholic. The
government does nothing to promote or encourage religion, but
tolerates the <ORGANIZATION>Roman Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> and other religious groups and
has been working to improve strained relations.
   The government recently returned places of worship that it said
were mistakenly confiscated during a period of nationalization
following independence. But hospitals and schools formerly run by
churches remain nationalized.

<TEXT>
   On the eve of Pope <PERSON>John Paul II</PERSON>'s fourth
African visit, bishops from nine nations on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> urged the
<LOCATION>Marxist Mozambique</LOCATION> government to talk peace with right-wing rebels.
   
   Archbishop <PERSON>Jaime Goncalves</PERSON>, president of the nine-nation
<ORGANIZATION>Inter-Regional Meeting of Bishops of Southern Africa</ORGANIZATION>, said ongoing
negotiations to end the 13-year conflict in <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION> set the stage
for peaceful dialogue in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>.
   ``Considering the situation in this region where people are
trying to solve conflict through dialogue, <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> should also
take part in calling people together to talk about ending the
war,'' <PERSON>Goncalves</PERSON> said. ``<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> should take the opportunity
now.''
   Goncalves, addressing a news conference in the capital of
<LOCATION>Harare</LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> government refused to meet with leaders
of the <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique National Resistance</ORGANIZATION>, also known by the Portuguese
acronym <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION>.
   Some 70 bishops from <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Lesotho</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sao Tome</LOCATION> and Principe, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> are gathered in <LOCATION>Harare</LOCATION> for the meeting.
   The pope will close the 10-day meeting <DATE>Saturday</DATE> at the beginning
of his first tour of five black-governed nations neighboring
white-ruled <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   Goncalves denied the <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> was in direct
confrontation with the government in <LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION>.
   ``At first the government said they did not agree with the
<ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION>. Now they say they understand the position of the
church,'' <PERSON>Goncalves</PERSON> said.
   <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> won independence from <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> in <DATE>1975</DATE> after
centuries of colonial rule and a decade of guerrilla war waged by
Marxist rebels of <ORGANIZATION>Frelimo</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION>. The
front is now the ruling party.
   Frelimo at independence accused the <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> of siding
with the Portuguese in that conflict, but relations between church
and state have since warmed.
   <PERSON>Goncalves</PERSON> said the bishops discussed ``the problem of peace'' in
southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, in line with the theme of the Pope's visit. The
papal tour will emphasize human rights in a region split by ``war
and injustice,'' <PERSON>Goncalves</PERSON> said.
   ``The church must consider what we can do for peace, justice and
welfare in this region,'' said <PERSON>Goncalves</PERSON>, who heads the Catholic
diocese of <LOCATION>Beira</LOCATION>. That port city is in <LOCATION>northern Mozambique</LOCATION>, where
RENAMO rebels have been blamed for the slaying of thousands of
civilians.
   The pontiff is scheduled to visit <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> before returning to
<LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sept. 19</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> has accused <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> of backing <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION>, a charge
denied by <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> has about 12,000 troops fighting alongside government
forces in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> and has repeatedly opposed dialogue with the
rebels.
   Both the <LOCATION>Harare</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION> governments argue the guerrillas have
no specific ideological aims and are simply terrorists supported by
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.

   Local militiamen and soldiers from
neighboring <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> stand guard over a pipeline, railroad and
crumbling highway. In the soporific heat, they talk of past
campaigns and the possibility of peace.
   There was a time when the enemy, an ubiquitous rebel army
accused of many atrocities, launched attacks of 1,000 men on the
three facilities, which are lifelines to the sea for <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s
inland neighbors.
   For the last few months, quiet has prevailed in the <LOCATION>Beira</LOCATION>
Corridor ascending from the port of <LOCATION>Beira</LOCATION>, through nearly 200 miles
of fertile savanna flecked with forests and swamps, to the <LOCATION>Vumba
Mountains</LOCATION> of <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>.
   Observers suggest the rebels, who remain active on either side
of the zone, prefer to attack poorly equipped government troops
rather than the heavily armed Zimbabwean military.
   ``We have a few firings along the road, that's all,'' said Col.
<PERSON>Michael Dube</PERSON>, one of the men commanding several thousand Zimbabwean
soldiers who have helped guard the transportation corridor since
<DATE>1984</DATE>.
   About 12,000 Zimbabwean troops are scattered throughout
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> to help government forces.
   Dube's troops make routine seven-day foot patrols from <LOCATION>Lamego</LOCATION>, a
mosquito-infested base camp on the edge of swamps about 45 miles
inland from the <LOCATION>Indian Ocean</LOCATION> coast.
   Armored convoys run another 110 miles westward to the Zimbabwean
brigade headquarters at <LOCATION>Chimoio</LOCATION>, just across the border, carrying
supplies to the soldiers and Mozambican militia posts.
   The corridor has remained open through most of the war, closing
only long enough for repairs to the railway after mine explosions
and other sabotage by the guerrillas, who began fighting in <DATE>1977</DATE>.
   Two Beira-bound trains trundle along the corridor most days,
carrying potash and railroad ties from <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>, tin and cobalt
from <LOCATION>Zaire</LOCATION> and Zimbabwean tobacco and granite. Trucks overloaded
with Zambian copper pound along the highway.
   Western donors and investors have contributed more than <MONEY>$400
million</MONEY> since <DATE>1986</DATE> for repairs to the transport system and
rebuilding <LOCATION>Beira</LOCATION>'s port and infrastructure.
   Keeping soldiers in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> costs <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> about <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY>
a year, according to official figures, and up to seven times that
by private estimates. <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> is infinitely better off than
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, but still is among the world's poorer nations.
   White settlers who ruled <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> when it was a British colony
called <LOCATION>Rhodesia</LOCATION> helped establish the rebel force to fight
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s Marxist government. <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> became independent of
<LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> in <DATE>1975</DATE>, two years before <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> was formed.
   <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> later became <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>'s main supporter, with the aim
of undermining <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> economically, and openly supported the
guerrillas until the two governments signed a peace agreement in
<DATE>1984</DATE>. No government now acknowledges aiding <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>.
   President <PERSON>Joachim Chissano</PERSON>'s ruling party, known as <ORGANIZATION>Frelimo</ORGANIZATION>,
officially dropped its hard-line Marxist policies in <DATE>1989</DATE>. In <DATE>July</DATE>,
the government said <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s first multiparty elections would
be held next year.
   <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> has demanded recognition by the government and free
Western-style elections, but has not made its political aims clear.
The guerrillas will be allowed to participate in the <DATE>1991</DATE> elections
if they lay down their arms.
   The war has killed an estimated 600,000 Mozambicans, displaced
more than 1 million and made the southeast African nation one of
the poorest in the world. Nearly half the 15 million people require
some food assistance and per capita income is less than <MONEY>$200</MONEY> a year.
   Peace talks have begun in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> between the government and exiled
rebel leaders, but Col. <PERSON>Dube</PERSON>'s men wait for peace with little cheer
or optimism.
   He and his junior officers sipped Dao, a cheap Portuguese red
wine, in a tidy dining tent and said peace would not come easily.
   Zimbabwean soldiers, with their far superior firepower,
equipment and air support, have little faith in Mozambican
government troops.
   ``When there's trouble, the first thing <ORGANIZATION>Frelimo</ORGANIZATION> do is run
away,'' said <PERSON>Dube</PERSON>, a Soviet-trained veteran of his own country's
war for independence, which ended a decade ago.
   A young officer, who asked not to be identified, said
militiamen, soldiers and rebels alike turned to banditry.
   The Zimbabweans have been accused of using armored vehicles,
which are seldom searched, to smuggle out ivory, gemstones,
valuable carvings and marijuana, which grows wild in central and
northern <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>.

   The <ORGANIZATION>Cahora Bassa Dam</ORGANIZATION>, a huge hydroelectric plant spanning the <LOCATION>Zambezi River</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>northwest Mozambique</LOCATION>, is capable of producing enough power to satisfy all of this country's energy requirements and <PERCENT>8%</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s needs as well. 

   But for much of the past decade, <LOCATION>Cahora Bassa</LOCATION> has generated nothing but pity. 
Its mighty turbines, silenced by the sabotage of anti-government rebels nurtured by <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, are a sorry monument to <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION>'s habit of destabilizing its neighbors. 
"It's such a shame," says <PERSON>Fernando Juliao</PERSON>, the general manager of <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s state-controlled electricity company. 
"When you think of <LOCATION>Cahora Bassa</LOCATION>, you always think of political problems." 

   Recently, however, <LOCATION>Cahora Bassa</LOCATION> has begun generating a current of hope. 
Talks between <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> (which built the dam during its colonial rule here) to rehabilitate the power project have sparked optimism that <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION>, the dominant political and economic power of southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, is ready to back up its "good neighbor" rhetoric with action. 
If so, a meeting in <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION> of the three countries this month could complete plans to put <LOCATION>Cahora Bassa</LOCATION> back on stream by year's end. 

   "If <LOCATION>Cahora Bassa</LOCATION> goes through, it will be the first concrete achievement of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> in regional cooperation," says <PERSON>Melissa Wells</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>. 
"It will be a milestone and something that should be built upon." 

   Diplomats and government sources in both countries believe that agreement on <LOCATION>Cahora Bassa</LOCATION> will pave the way for a meeting between Mozambican President <PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON> and South African President <PERSON>P.W. Botha</PERSON>. 
The negotiations over <LOCATION>Cahora Bassa</LOCATION>, which began in <DATE>November</DATE>, already have prompted an unprecedented exchange of letters between the leaders. 
Political and military officials of both countries have held meetings designed to resurrect the <ORGANIZATION>Joint Security Commission</ORGANIZATION>, a consultative body that collapsed in <DATE>1985</DATE> over charges by <LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION> that <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> was continuing to support the Mozambican rebels, called <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>. 

   "<LOCATION>Cahora Bassa</LOCATION> cuts across everything in our bilateral relations," says <PERSON>Glen Babb</PERSON>, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s deputy director general for foreign affairs. 
"It's a matter of putting mutual interests first." 

   For <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, which urgently needs the additional energy capacity <LOCATION>Cahora Bassa</LOCATION> can supply, the project is ripe with irony. 
"<LOCATION>Cahora Bassa</LOCATION> is forcing <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> to take sides in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>," says a Western diplomat in <LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION>. 
"If the rehabilitation is to succeed, they have to take a stand against <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>." 

   <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> was set up in the mid-1970s by agents of the white Rhodesian government intent on destabilizing the new post-colonial Marxist government in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>. 
When <LOCATION>Rhodesia</LOCATION> became black-ruled <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE>, the white government of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> began assisting <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>. 
The rebels soon gained control of much of the <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> countryside, and the <LOCATION>Cahora Bassa</LOCATION> line made an easy target for sabotage. 
Eventually, the power was cut off. 

   To get the power flowing again, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> must cooperate with the Mozambican government to protect the line, which runs for 558 miles inside <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, from further <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> attacks. 
Sources in both countries say <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> agreed to contribute "nonlethal" aid, such as trucks, mine sweepers, and medical supplies, and to supply the bulk of the <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY> needed for the first phase of rehabilitation. 
Both sides vigorously denied reports that South African advisers will train Mozambican soldiers, though sources say <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> may need to train a small number of people to use specialized equipment. 

   Still, there are doubts about whether the line, much of which runs through rebel-controlled territory, can be protected without coming to some kind of accommodation with <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>. 
Mozambican officials, who claim <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION> still assists the rebels, say it is up to <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> to tell <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> to lay off the line. 

   At the moment, though, <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> seems to be under no one's control in the countryside, making its reaction to the <LOCATION>Cahora Bassa</LOCATION> rehabilitation unpredictable. 
In apparent protest to the talks, <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> has attacked a main road leading to <LOCATION>Cahora Bassa</LOCATION>, making overland travel to the dam unsafe. 
Diplomats here say the rehabilitated line could make an even more inviting target to rebel leaders anxious to prove their independence from <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. 

   The South African government insists it severed ties with <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> after the signing of the <LOCATION>Nkomati Accord</LOCATION> with <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> in <DATE>1984</DATE>. 
Under that agreement, <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION> promised to cut off aid to <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> while <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> pledged not to harbor guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION>African National Congress</ORGANIZATION>, the liberation movement working to topple the South African government. 

   "We do not and will not support <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>," says <PERSON>David Laubscher</PERSON>, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s trade representative to <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>. (The two countries don't have full diplomatic ties.) 
"No matter what the history of <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> is, or the previous accusations, at this stage the question is to start off and cooperate with <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>." 

   <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> hopes <LOCATION>Cahora Bassa</LOCATION>'s rehabilitation will foster reconciliation talks between the Mozambican government and <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>. 
Chances for this seem remote, as <LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION>, which accuses the rebels of committing atrocities in the countryside, refuses to meet with <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>. 
But <PERSON>Mr. Babb</PERSON>, the South African official, says <ORGANIZATION>Cahora Bassa</ORGANIZATION> "will show that reconciliation is the only solution for <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>." 

   It also will show, say energy officials from both countries, that reconciliation between the politically hostile states in southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> is the only solution for regional economic development. 
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, which uses two-thirds of the electricity consumed on the continent, could use the 1,500 megawatts it can get from <LOCATION>Cahora Bassa</LOCATION> to allow Eskom, its utility, to defer expenses of building a new power plant. 

   For <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cahora Bassa</LOCATION> is a domestic power source that will reduce the country's reliance on South African-supplied energy. 
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> currently pays <MONEY>15 million rand</MONEY> (<MONEY>$6.7 million</MONEY>) a year for electricity from <LOCATION>Eskom</LOCATION>, almost <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s annual export earnings. 

   "Anybody with common sense wants to get <LOCATION>Cahora Bassa</LOCATION> working again," says <PERSON>Mr. Juliao</PERSON>. 
"Look, our political problems can't last forever. 
Even wars have to end sometime."

<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mozambican rebels claimed <DATE>Monday</DATE> that
government forces backed by Zimbabwean troops and planes have
launched a major offensive against guerrilla positions in central
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>.
   A statement distributed in the Portuguese capital by the
<ORGANIZATION>Mozambican National Resistance</ORGANIZATION> said 2,500 Mozambican and Zimbabwean
troops attacked rebel strongholds in the <LOCATION>Gorongoza</LOCATION> highlands <DATE>Monday</DATE>
in <LOCATION>Sofala</LOCATION> province.
   The statement said the offensive was spearheaded by troops
carried by Zimbabwean transport planes and backed by Soviet-built
combat planes and helicopters.
   The Mozambican news agency AIM reported <DATE>Saturday</DATE> that government
forces had destroyed four rebel camps the past week, one in <LOCATION>Sofala</LOCATION>
and three in the south.
   The AIM report said 57 rebels were killed in the actions, but
gave no indication these were major operations. AIM made no mention
of Zimbabwean troops.
   Rebel leader <PERSON>Afonso Dhlakama</PERSON> is thought to have his headquarters
in <LOCATION>Gorongoza</LOCATION>, 560 miles north of the capital <LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION>.
   The rebels, who are also known by the Portuguese acronym <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>,
said a column of infantry and artillery was supporting the airborne
troops. There was no independent confirmation of the rebel claims.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> statement said the attack showed the ``bad faith'' of
Zimbabwean President <PERSON>Robert Mugabe</PERSON>, who together with his Kenyan
counterpart <PERSON>Daniel arap Moi</PERSON> has been attempting to mediate
tentative peace moves to end 13 years of fighting in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>.
   Despite intermittent talks between <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> officials and
Mozambican church leaders in <LOCATION>Nairobi</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>, since <DATE>last July</DATE>,
reports of violent clashes have continued.
   Earlier this month, the government accused <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> of killing
over 50 civilians in an attack on a train bringing Mozambican
miners from work in neighboring <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   The rebels have faced repeated accusations of civilian massacres
since they launched their insurgency in <DATE>1977</DATE>, two years after
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> gained independence from <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> formerly supported the rebels, but since a <DATE>1984</DATE>
accord between <LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION> no government openly backs the
rebels.

<TEXT>
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> should act as a
mediator between <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> in a bid to resolve
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s 12-year civil war, Foreign Minister <PERSON>Pik Botha</PERSON> said
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> said at a news briefing that the talks should include the
governments of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, with the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>
mediating and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> welcome to participate.
   He did not say if the talks should include rebels of the
<ORGANIZATION>Mozambique National Resistance</ORGANIZATION>, who have been waging a guerrilla war
since <DATE>1977</DATE> in a bid to undermine the country's Marxist government.
   <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> backed the rebels in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE>, but says it
halted assistance in <DATE>1984</DATE> under the terms of a mutual non-aggression
pact with <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> has accused <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> of continuing to aid the
rebels, a charge <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> denies. South African President <PERSON>P.W.
Botha</PERSON> visited <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s President <PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON> in <DATE>September</DATE>
and relations have improved during the past year, although
Mozambican officials still contend on occasion that <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>
continues to support the guerrillas.
   No government acknowledges assisting the rebels, who have ravaged
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s economy with hit-and-run attacks on civilian and
military targets.
   <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> is one of the poorest countries in the world and an
estimated 6 million of its 15 million people need food aid.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is the leading donor of aid to <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>,
which has increased ties with Western nations in recent years
although most of its weapons come from the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that (the <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>) war will
have to stop,'' <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> said. ``I have no illusions about what is
ahead of us, but I know it can be done.''
   He said he envisioned negotiations similar to last year's talks
on southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> involving <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
mediators. More than a dozen rounds of negotiations culminated in
<DATE>December</DATE> with an agreement for <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> to withdraw its 50,000 troops
from <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION> and for <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> to grant independence to <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>,
or <LOCATION>South-West Africa</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> said <DATE>today</DATE> that the southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> agreement appears on
track. <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> already has withdrawn more than 3,000 soldiers from
<LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>, although it was not required to reach that figure until
<DATE>April 1</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> is to begin implementing Namibian independence on
<DATE>April 1</DATE>, leading to U.N.-supervised elections <DATE>Nov. 1</DATE>.
   The Angolan rebel movement <ORGANIZATION>UNITA</ORGANIZATION> was not included in the peace
talks and has vowed to continue the 13-year-old war until it has a
power-sharing agreement with <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>'s Marxist government.
   It is not clear how the <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique National Resistance</ORGANIZATION> would
respond to any regional peace agreement in which it did not
participate.

<FP=106> [Report from <LOCATION>Nampula</LOCATION> by correspondent <PERSON>Edmundo Galiza Matos</PERSON>] </F>
  [Text] At mass rallies held in the capitals of <LOCATION>Malema</LOCATION> and 
<ORGANIZATION>Lalaua Districts of Nampula Province</ORGANIZATION> today, President of the 
Republic <PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON> said the promoters of war in 
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> have begun to return to the country, because they are 
convinced conditions have already been created to take the reins 
of power. Speaking to large crowds, <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> mentioned the cases 
of Portuguese nationals currently residing in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> as the ones returning to <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, where they have 
launched a campaign to discredit the <ORGANIZATION>Mozambican Government</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> said the campaign is based on the old colonial 
principle that blacks have never been able to govern themselves. 
He said such people have always backed <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> [<ORGANIZATION>Mozambique 
National Resistance</ORGANIZATION>] in the destruction of <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, though 
they never believed in the capacity of <PERSON>Afonso Dhlakama</PERSON>'s 
movement to govern anything. 
  The president of the republic said the destruction of the 
town of <LOCATION>Lalaua</LOCATION>, while it was under <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> occupation for 45 days 
beginning <DATE>July 1991</DATE>, was ordered by those who have never 
accepted the country's independence. Chissano was referring to 
people who abandoned <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> before and after independence to 
settle in <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>. 
  The president of the republic warned the residents of the 
two 
towns that in the current multiparty system there are people who 
promote campaigns on behalf of their parties, promising to 
resolve the nation's problems in a short period of time. 
  Chissano's speeches in <LOCATION>Malema</LOCATION> and Lalaua focused on peace, 
national reconciliation, and hard work on the basis of unity of 
all Mozambicans from north to south of the country. The 
Mozambican head of state accused those who claim that the 
<ORGANIZATION>Mozambique Government</ORGANIZATION> is formed mainly by southerners, of 
promoting division in the country. <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> said that that was 
not true, giving as an example the various ministers included in 
his delegation who come from different parts of the country. 
Chissano added: <ORGANIZATION>Frelimo</ORGANIZATION> chooses competent people for 
government posts, regardless of their ethnic origin. 
  Malema residents demanded from <PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON> that 
passenger services be revamped along the recently renovated 
<ORGANIZATION>Nacala</ORGANIZATION> railroad. Nampula residents often travel on tank cars and 
rail cars. The residents also complained about serious cases of 
police brutality at railroad stations. Asked to explain the 
lack of passenger coaches, the director general of the 
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> Railroad enterprise said that there were 200 
passenger coaches in <DATE>1975</DATE>, but today there are only 46 
throughout the country. The others, he said, were destroyed 
during the war. Chissano commented on this issue, saying: those 
who destroyed the rail cars should buy them, instead of asking 
us for money. 
  As in his visits to <LOCATION>Gaza</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sofala</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Tete Provinces</PERSON>, the 
president of the republic urged <PERSON>Malema</PERSON> and Lalaua residents to 
vote in large numbers during the <DATE>October</DATE> elections to choose the 
best representatives of the Mozambican society for the future 
government. 
  Chissano returned to the city of <LOCATION>Nampula</LOCATION> <TIME>this evening</TIME>. 
Tomorrow, he is scheduled to leave for <ORGANIZATION>Nacala</ORGANIZATION> where he will 
assess the damage caused by the <PERSON>Nadia</PERSON> cyclone and address a mass 
rally. Chissano will meet the province's businessmen after his 
return from <LOCATION>Nacala</LOCATION>.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Mozambique peace pact promises end to 16-year civil war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OPPOSING leaders in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s civil war signed an accord yesterday
which could bring peace to the country for the first time in three decades.
At a ceremony in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>, President <PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr Afonso Dhlakama</PERSON>,
leader of the <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> rebels, agreed to end hostilities in the 16-year civil
war by <DATE>October 1</DATE>. The war, which followed a guerrilla conflict seeking
independence from <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>, achieved in <DATE>1975</DATE>, has devastated the already
impoverished country.
War and drought have forced a quarter of the 15m population to flee, and
fighting has seriously hindered efforts to avert starvation.
The six-page agreement, the result of nearly two years of intermittent
talks, calls for the international community and the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> in
particular to help monitor the agreement, which provides for <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s
first multiparty elections.
Implementation of the pact will be a formidable task, given the destruction
of the infrastructure and fears that <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> is not so much an organised
movement as a collection of gangs and warlords. Yesterday's news that <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>
attacks continued during the latest peace talks may be a symptom of this
kind of indiscipline.
Participants in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> remained optimistic, however. 'This is an historic day
for the people of <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> . . . Please, no more deaths,' said
<LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> president <PERSON>Robert Mugabe</PERSON>, who, with church leaders and the Italian
government, helped arrange the pact.
President <PERSON>Mugabe</PERSON> and President <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> paid tribute at the signing to the
role played in the long peace process by <PERSON>Mr Tiny Rowland</PERSON>, chief executive of
<ORGANIZATION>Lonrho</ORGANIZATION>, the British conglomerate. 'Well done, <ORGANIZATION>Tiny</ORGANIZATION>,' said <PERSON>Mr Mugabe</PERSON>,
embracing <PERSON>Mr Rowland</PERSON>, while <PERSON>Mr Chissano</PERSON> spoke of 'our friend Tiny'.
Lonrho has big commercial, agro-industrial and mining interests in
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Mr Rowland</PERSON>'s involvement in the peace process goes
back over two years, when he arranged the first meeting of the two sides in
<LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION>. He has also been trying to mediate in the Sudanese civil war.

<HEAD>Rebels Claim Cuban Troops Enter Mozambique</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mozambican rebels claimed <DATE>Saturday</DATE> that
hundreds of Cuban combat troops have entered the southern African
country to help government forces fighting in the country's
12-year-old civil war.
   A <ORGANIZATION>Mozambican National Resistance</ORGANIZATION> statement said almost 600 Cuban
soldiers have arrived in <LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION> in the past week and warned the
presence complicates ongoing peace talks.
   There was no immediate comment on the claims from President
<PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON>'s Marxist government.
   Peace talks between the guerrilla organization and Mozambican
church leaders representing the government resumed this week in
<LOCATION>Nairobi</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>. No details of the negotiations have been released by
either side or Kenyan mediators.
   During talks last month, the two sides said they exchanged peace
plans.
   The rebel statement, released in <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION> and signed by the rebel's
resident delegate <PERSON>Manuel Frank</PERSON>, said the Cubans are members of
motorized infantry units. It said they arrived between <DATE>Aug. 25</DATE> and
<DATE>Monday</DATE> in the Mozambican capital and more are slated to arrive next
week.
   According to <PERSON>Frank</PERSON>, government officials claim the Cubans are
Mozambicans returning from training in <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>.
   The rebel claims come as <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> is involved in a phased withdrawal
of about 50,000 troops in another southern African country, <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>,
under an agreement in exchange for <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> pulling out its
troops from <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION> and granting <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> independence.
   <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> receives military aid from the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and its
allies and has accepted several hundred Soviet, Cuban and East
German advisers.
   But the only foreign troops known to be fighting the rebels
alongside Mozambican government forces at present are 12,000
Zimbabwean soldiers protecting an oil pipeline and road and rail
links from <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s Indian Ocean ports to their landlocked
nation.
   <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s guerrilla statement said the government has yet to
answer the rebels' call for direct talks.
   <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> used to back <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s guerrillas, but says it
ended its support in <DATE>1984</DATE> when it signed a mutual non-aggression
pact with <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>.
   No government now openly supports the rebels, who are accused of
widespread atrocities against civilians.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>P.W. Botha</PERSON> will make
his first official visit to neighboring, Marxist-ruled <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>,
the countries said <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   Botha's meeting <DATE>Monday</DATE> with Mozambican President <PERSON>Joaquim
Chissano</PERSON> will underscore the improving relations between the
long-hostile countries, although <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> continues to charge
that <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> supports an 11-year-old guerrilla insurgency in
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Botha</PERSON>, during his 10 years as head of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s
white-controlled government, has paid an official visit to
<LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION> and made a secret visit to South African troops fighting
in <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>.
   But he has not made an official state visit to neighboring
<LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>, three of the so-called front-line
states that vehemently oppose <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s apartheid policies of
racial segregation.
   <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s national news agency AIM, quoting unidentified
official sources in <LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> and <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> would meet in
the town of <LOCATION>Songo</LOCATION>, in the far-northern province of Tete.
   The <ORGANIZATION>South African Department of Foreign Affairs</ORGANIZATION> confirmed
<PERSON>Botha</PERSON>'s visit, but did not release any details. The department also
said <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> would travel <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION>, the only African nation
that has full diplomatic relations with <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   The sources quoted by <ORGANIZATION>AIM</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> and <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> would discuss
``matters of common interest'' and would meet ``in the spirit of
the <LOCATION>Nkomati</LOCATION> Accord.''
   The accord is a mutual non-aggression treaty signed in <DATE>1984</DATE> by
<PERSON>Botha</PERSON> and <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON>Samora Machel</PERSON>, during a ceremony
at the two countries' border.
   <PERSON>Machel</PERSON> was killed in a plane crash on South African territory in
<DATE>October 1986</DATE>. Mozambique blamed <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> for the crash, saying
a false radio beacon lured the plane off course, but a South
African-organized panel of international experts blamed the
accident on errors by the Soviet crew.
   Chissano, chosen in <DATE>November 1986</DATE> to succeed <PERSON>Machel</PERSON>, has
increased <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s contacts with the West, which now provides
extensive aid to the war- and drought-wracked country.
   The Soviet bloc continues to supply weaponry and military
training, but most Western governments support <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON>'s
government and have denounced the often brutal tactics of the
rebels.
   <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> has repeatedly accused <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> of violating the
<DATE>1984</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Nkomati Accord</ORGANIZATION> by assisting the <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique National Resistance</ORGANIZATION>
guerrilla movement. <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, which aided the rebels before the
accord, says it has halted the assistance.
   In the past year, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> has expanded its trade mission in
<LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION>, pursued economic development possibilities in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>
and revived a joint military monitoring commission established in
the <LOCATION>Nkomati Accord</LOCATION>.
   The two countries also have signed an agreement aimed at
rehabilitating a giant hydroelectric project near <LOCATION>Songo</LOCATION> so it can
purchase electricity from <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique National Resistance</ORGANIZATION> rebels repeatedly have
sabotaged the <LOCATION>Cahora Bassa</LOCATION> hydroelectric project.
   Even when their relations were badly strained, <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> maintained extensive ties. Tens of thousands of

<FP=106> [Report by correspondent <PERSON>Leonel Matias</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION> on the </F>
"<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> Last Minute" program] 
  [Text] President <PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON> has admitted publicly for 
the first time that the Mozambican Government could make use of 
force against neighboring <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION> in connection with the alleged 
illegal entry into Mozambican territory of armed <ORGANIZATION>Malawi Young 
Pioneers</ORGANIZATION> [MYP] men, who belong to <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION>Congress 
Party</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>MCP</ORGANIZATION>. This is the first such statement to have been made 
by the Mozambican head of state since those Malawian youths 
allegedly came into <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> at the end of <DATE>last year</DATE> and since 
the two governments had met in <DATE>January</DATE> and agreed to cooperate 
to settle the problem. Speaking to <ORGANIZATION>Mozambican Television</ORGANIZATION>, 
President <PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON> had this to say: 
  [Begin Chissano recording] With regard to the use of force 
by 
us, everything depends on the outcome of those efforts to settle 
the problem. If the outcome dictates the need to use force, 
then it will be the country's duty to defend its territorial 
integrity. I think, though, that it will not be necessary to go 
that far. [end recording] 
  There are contradictory reports concerning the alleged entry 
of armed MYP men into Mozambican territory. Some government 
sources have already accused the <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique National Resistance</ORGANIZATION>, 
<ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>, of giving shelter to those youths. <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> has, however, 
challenged the government to tell the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> where those 
men are. Other reports say that those MYP men were placed in 
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> to be used at a later stage to destabilize <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION>, 
should the ruling <ORGANIZATION>MCP</ORGANIZATION> lose. This is the first major incident 
between the two countries ever since <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> threatened to 
place missiles along the border. The <ORGANIZATION>Mozambican Government</ORGANIZATION> had 
said at the time that <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION> was involved in a major <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> 
military offensive aimed at creating the so-called Republic of 
Rombezia. 
  However, the <ORGANIZATION>Mozambican Government</ORGANIZATION> is also having a bad time 
of relations with neighboring <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>. Maputo is annoyed about 
the fact that the Zimbabwean Government led by <PERSON>Robert Mugabe</PERSON>, 
who fought his war of independence with the support of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Mozambique Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Frelimo</ORGANIZATION>, and later helped the 
<ORGANIZATION>Frelimo</ORGANIZATION> government in its war against <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>, should now be 
giving greater attention to relations with <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
   The leader of the <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>
rebels has called off peace talks with Mozambican President <PERSON>Joaquim
Chissano</PERSON>'s government.
   <PERSON>Afonso Dhlakama</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique National Resistance</ORGANIZATION>,
said on South African television <DATE>Sunday</DATE> the rebels would not take
part in the talks because government soldiers, backed by troops
from <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>, had started a new offensive against the rebels.
   The rebels have been battling <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s government since
<DATE>1977</DATE>. They say they are seeking recognition as a political party
and free elections. But the rebels' political goals have never been
clear; they have been accused of widespread atrocities against
civilians.
   Periodic peace talks have been held in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>. There have been no
breakthroughs, but more negotiations were expected.
   Zimbabwean troops have been assisting the <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> government
for several years. Their primary aim is to help protect
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Beira</LOCATION> corridor railroad, which is landlocked
<LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>'s shortest route to the Indian Ocean.
   The Mozambican war has left the southeastern African country one
of the poorest in the world. Annual per capita income is less than
<MONEY>$200</MONEY> and almost half the 15 million people require some food
assistance.
   Chissano, a former <ORGANIZATION>Marxist</ORGANIZATION>, has been making political and
economic reforms. <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s parliament is debating a new
constitution that would allow opposition parties to compete in
elections next year.

<TEXT>
   Rebels fighting the Marxist government of
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> are still getting aid from <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>State
Department</ORGANIZATION> official said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   But <PERSON>Alison Rosenberg</PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary for <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, said
she didn't know the source of the money or how much was being sent.
   ``We've done our best to publicize our views in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> and
we've told the <LOCATION>South Africans</LOCATION> of our concern,'' <PERSON>Ms. Rosenberg</PERSON> told
the <ORGANIZATION>House Foreign Affairs African</ORGANIZATION> subcommittee.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique National Resistance</ORGANIZATION>, known by its Portuguese
acronym of RENAM0, has been fighting the government for 12 years,
starting shortly after the nation won independence from <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>.
Thousands of Portuguese colonists fled <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> to neighboring
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and many support <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION>.
   The <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> news agency AIM says 600,000 people, most of them
children, have died as a result of the fighting. Refugees estimated
at 800,000 to 1 million have fled to <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION> are among the world's poorest countries.
The average citizen earns about <MONEY>$150</MONEY> a year, according to the <ORGANIZATION>World
Bank</ORGANIZATION>.
   But <PERSON>Edward V. K. Jaycox</PERSON>, the bank's vice president for <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>,
listed both among the African countries where incomes are beginning
to improve after a decade or more of decline. At a news conference
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, he singled out <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION> for what he called a tremendous
performance despite the burden of caring for the refugees.
   <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, where the average annual income reached <MONEY>$1,890</MONEY> in
<DATE>1987</DATE>, is among the most prosperous African countries.
   In <DATE>1984</DATE>, <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> agreed that South African
aid to the rebels would cease and <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> would expel guerrillas
of the <ORGANIZATION>African National Congress</ORGANIZATION> who attack <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   ``We support the accord,'' <PERSON>Ms. Rosenberg</PERSON> said.
   The <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> government has charged <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> with violating
the agreement.
   Last month, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials welcomed a call by South African
Foreign Minister <PERSON>Pik Botha</PERSON> for the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to mediate the
fighting. <PERSON>E. Gibson Lanpher</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION>'s top official for
southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, said he wanted to find out if <PERSON>Botha</PERSON>'s proposal
included <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> said he envisioned negotiations like those of last year on
southwest <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. They included representatives of <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> mediators and resulted in an agreement that
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> would begin the grant of independence to <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> on
<DATE>April 1</DATE>.

   <PERSON>Howard Ruff</PERSON> says in his <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE> letter that <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> represents the anti-communist resistance forces in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, is an indigenous movement and is supported by the majority of Mozambicans. 
Well, is this the view of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government? 

   Here are excerpts from the testimony of <PERSON>Chester A. Crocker</PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for African affairs, before the <ORGANIZATION>Subcommittee</ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Foreign Relations Committee</ORGANIZATION>, <DATE>June 24, 1987</DATE>:
   "Another persistent myth about <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> holds that the insurgent movement <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> is a democratic alternative to the government of <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>. 
Here again, a little history is in order. 

   "<ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> was created by the Rhodesian secret services in <DATE>1977</DATE> to punish <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> for the country's assistance to Zimbabwean liberation movements. 
With Zimbabwean independence in <DATE>1980</DATE>, sponsorship of <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> was taken over by the <ORGANIZATION>South African Defense Force</ORGANIZATION> . . . 

   "Renamo appears to draw most of its adherents from the Ndau-Shona tribal group of central <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>. 
It has shown little capability to expand its political influence in other areas of the country or to create a cohesive political organization, even in areas where it has ethnic support. 
Credible reports of <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> atrocities against the civilian population have undercut its popular appeal, as have increasingly apparent divisions among its military and political leaders." 

   Let your readers judge who is accurately describing <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Ruling Party Drops References To Marxism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling <ORGANIZATION>Frelimo</ORGANIZATION> party presented a
new policy document <DATE>Friday</DATE> that drops all references to Marxism,
Leninism and Western imperialism.
   The document, submitted at the party's first national congress
since <DATE>1983</DATE>, says <ORGANIZATION>Frelimo</ORGANIZATION>, the Front for the Liberation of
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, remains committed to socialism. But it deletes
references to ``the class struggle'' and says party members should
``express the aspirations of the entire people.''
   The alterations coincide with a new drive by the government to
end a 12-year-old civil war that has devastated the economy and
left millions of Mozambicans dead, displaced or dependent on food
aid.
   President <PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON> has asked Presidents <PERSON>Robert Mugabe</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Daniel arap Moi</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> to arrange for preliminary
peace talks with rebels of the <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique National Resistance</ORGANIZATION>.
   For many years, Mozambican authorities have accused neighboring
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> of supporting the rebels, but <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> said this month
he was prepared to accept assurances that the South African
government no longer sanctioned such aid.
   Frelimo took power in <DATE>1975</DATE> after a prolonged guerrilla war
against Portuguese colonial rule. Frelimo leaders established a
one-party, Marxist-Leninist state and described themselves in a
<DATE>1983</DATE> policy document as ``the vanguard of the worker-peasant
alliance.''
   The new document describes the party as ``the vanguard of the
Mozambican people'' and deletes a previous reference to
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s role in a ``world anti-imperialist front.''
   That change reflects <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s improving relations with
Western countries such as the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>,
which supply substantial quantities of aid.
   <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s government has maintained its close ties with the
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and other <LOCATION>East</LOCATION> bloc countries. The new policy document
calls for ``an independent foreign policy based on the defense of
national interests.''
   The government for several years has been moving to end central
control of the economy. It has met loan conditions from the
<ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> and has experienced
modest growth in the <DATE>past two years after a decade</DATE> of sharp decline.
   <ORGANIZATION>Frelimo</ORGANIZATION> also has proposed allowing businessmen, property owners,
shopkeepers and religious believers to join the party after years
of poor relations.
   About 200,000 of <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s 15 million people belong to
<ORGANIZATION>Frelimo</ORGANIZATION>.

   Mozambican rebels claimed <DATE>Friday</DATE> that
Zimbabwean warplanes bombed rebel-held territory in western
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> and killed 129 civilians.
   No immediate comment was available from <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>, which like
<LOCATION>Tanzania</LOCATION> has troops helping President <PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON>'s Marxist
government fight the right-wing <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique National Resistance</ORGANIZATION>.
   A rebel statement distributed in <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>, said the <DATE>May
21</DATE> and 30 attacks in <LOCATION>Tete</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Manica</LOCATION> and Gaza provinces are an attempt
to force civilians to seek refuge in government-controlled areas.
   Soviet-built MiG-21 jet fighters and Mi-8 helicopters were used
in the attack, the rebels said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique National Resistance</ORGANIZATION> regularly denies accusations
that its guerrillas commit widespread atrocities against civilians
in the hit-and-run insurgency they have waged since <DATE>1977</DATE>, after
<LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> gave <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> its independence.
   <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> denies it is continuing aid for the rebels despite
signing a non-aggression pact with <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> in <DATE>1984</DATE>.

<TEXT>
TO suffer one war can be disastrous. To experience four in less than three
decades accounts for the catastrophe that is <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>.
But if this week's peace accord - a belated consequence of the complex peace
process under way in southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> - is put into effect, recovery can at
last begin. Behind it lie the end of superpower rivalry and the proxy
battles it led to, and the South African government's decision to negotiate
a post-apartheid constitution.
For <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, however, the benefits have been a long time coming, and its
tribulations go back many years.
The guerrilla campaign that won independence from <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> in <DATE>1975</DATE> proved a
pyrrhic victory, triggering an exodus of hundreds of thousands of whites,
many of whom sabotaged what they were forced to leave behind, leaving the
country bereft of skills.
Ill equipped for independence after centuries of Portuguese misrule,
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s plight deepened when it took the part of rebels in the conflict
in neighbouring <LOCATION>Rhodesia</LOCATION>.
Rhodesian retaliation took two forms: attacking guerrilla bases and economic
targets such as power stations and bridges, and creating <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>, the rebel
group led by <PERSON>Mr Afonso Dhlakama</PERSON>, co-signatory to yesterday's agreement.
<LOCATION>Rhodesia</LOCATION>'s emergence as independent <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE> brought no respite.
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> took over its role as the backer of <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>, training and
supplying a loosely organised army of local war lords, renegades and
defectors from the ruling <ORGANIZATION>Frelimo</ORGANIZATION> party.
By then <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> was playing a frontline role once more, providing a
secure base for the military wing of the <ORGANIZATION>African National Congress</ORGANIZATION> (ANC) of
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
But by <DATE>1984</DATE>, enervated by civil conflict and <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION>'s attacks, <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>
submitted to her powerful neighbour. In <DATE>May 1984</DATE> the late President <PERSON>Samora
Machel</PERSON> and the then South African president, <PERSON>Mr PW Botha</PERSON>, signed the <LOCATION>Nkomati</LOCATION>
non-aggression pact.
Unconsulted and unprepared, the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> was bundled out of <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>. In
return, South African assistance to <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> was to end.
It never did. Covert aid to the rebels continued at least until President FW
de Klerk took office in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> in <DATE>1989</DATE>, and there is some doubt
whether it ended then.
The seeds of <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> were the black soldiers who had served <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>'s cause
in the run-up to independence, many of whom took sanctuary in <LOCATION>Rhodesia</LOCATION>. But
they fell on fertile ground. Popular at first, <ORGANIZATION>Frelimo</ORGANIZATION> steadily alienated
many of its supporters, by mismanagement of the economy, its authoritarian
style, or by ignoring or overriding the wishes of traditional community
leaders.
<ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>, tutored by <ORGANIZATION>US</ORGANIZATION> and South African advisers, refined its ideology,
portraying itself as a movement that stood for multiparty democracy and a
market economy.
And although it is renowned for its brutality, in recent years its claim to
grass-roots support has gained credibility. But whoever wins the promised
elections that lie ahead will inherit an impoverished nation deeply scarred
by war.

<HEAD>Mozambique Rebels Ambush Train From South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rightist rebels ambushed a passenger
train en route from <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION>, killing eight people and
injuring 38, <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s national news agency AIM reported <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   State radio blamed <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s attack on ``forces within <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION>'' trying to wreck an ongoing peace initiative between
Marxist-ruled <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON>Pik Botha</PERSON> condemned the bombing
and reiterated that his government no longer supports the guerrilla
<ORGANIZATION>Mozambican National Resistance</ORGANIZATION>.
   In a statement, <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> said <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> is opposed to violence as
a means of settling the <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> conflict.
   AIM said the train hit a land mine 30 miles northwest of <LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION>
then was fired on by rebels, who have waged a hit-and-run insurgency
since <DATE>1977</DATE>.
   President <PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON>'s government contended <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>
violated a <DATE>1984</DATE> non-aggression pact and continued to aid the
guerrillas. But relations between the neighbors have improved.
Chissano and South African President <PERSON>P.W. Botha</PERSON> held a summit
meeting in <DATE>September</DATE> and <PERSON>Pik Botha</PERSON> last month opened new offices for
<LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION>'s trade mission in <LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION>.
   A <ORGANIZATION>Radio Mozambique</ORGANIZATION> commentary said unspecified elements in <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION> were helping the rebels in attempts to destroy the peace
initiative.
   ``The forces that command banditry, at whatever level they are to
be found within South African society, are telling us through the
explosions of these mines, the rattle of these machine guns, that
they do not want peace and cooperation between <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION>,'' the radio said. ``They want war, death and destruction.''
   Mozambican sources in the past have suggested a possible split
within the South African government regarding <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, with
relatively moderate Foreign Affairs officials favoring rapprochement
and some military officers wanting covert aid for the rebels to keep
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> weak.

<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAMPULA, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government, mired in a civil war
that is sinking the country ever deeper into poverty and famine, is
making overtures toward its two main enemies.
   The 12-year-old war is stalemated, and <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s Marxist
leaders now appear interested in making a deal with <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> to
complement generous amnesty terms offered to rebels of the
<ORGANIZATION>Mozambique National Resistance</ORGANIZATION>.
   Since the amnesty law took effect in <DATE>December</DATE>, an estimated 500
to 700 guerrillas have surrendered with a government promise that
they will be not be punished for their war activities.
   Also, <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s president, <PERSON>Joachim Chissano</PERSON>, sent Cooperation
Minister <PERSON>Jacinto Veloso</PERSON> to <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> on <DATE>April 26</DATE> with a
conciliatory message for President <PERSON>P.W. Botha</PERSON>. The possibility of a
summit meeting was discussed.
   A day earlier, <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> met with <PERSON>Gavin Relly</PERSON>, chairman of <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION>'s giant <ORGANIZATION>Anglo American Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, to discuss possible business
ventures.
   Chissano continues to accuse <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> of supporting the
rebels in violation of a <DATE>1984</DATE> non-aggression pact, a charge
<LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION> denies.
   However, <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s decision to renew high-level contacts with
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> suggests it forsees no quick military solutions to the
war, which the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. State Department</ORGANIZATION> says has claimed an estimated
100,000 lives in the past three years.
   The fighting in northeastern <LOCATION>Nampula</LOCATION> province, visited recently
by a group of Western journalists, is representative of the
deadlocked war in many parts of <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>.
   The rebels roam the countryside at will, attacking villages to
obtain supplies and often kidnapping residents as forced laborers.
   Government troops fight an almost entirely defensive war,
attempting to protect economic installations and to keep
transporation routes open, but seldom seeking out the rebels in the
bush.
   Eighteen of the 21 district capitals in <LOCATION>Nampula</LOCATION> province have
been attacked since <DATE>last October</DATE>. Refugee camps are swelling and
food is in short supply in most areas. Hospitals dispense aspirin
and anti-malaria tablets, but not much else.
   Repeated rebel sabotage on the railway that runs across the
province prompted a European consortium to halt repair work until
the government can guarantee their security.
   ``The frequent attacks disrupt the villages and discourage
people from staying and planting crops,'' said <PERSON>Jacob Jeremiah
Nyambir</PERSON>, the provincial governor. ``We are trying to reorganize the
military and stabilize the civilian situation.''
   Nyambir and other local officials cited several incidents that
highlight the military's shortcomings.
   Nyambir pointed on a map to the three main rebel camps in
<LOCATION>Nampula</LOCATION> province, but said the military has never been able to
carry out attacks against the locations.
   When rebels raided the northern coastal city of <LOCATION>Angoche</LOCATION> <DATE>last
year</DATE>, they they were repelled by the military, local officials
said. However, the rebels kidnapped 300 civilians and the army made
no attempt to pursue them.
   Because of poor communications, word of rebel attacks on remote
villages can take a week to reach the city of <LOCATION>Nampula</LOCATION>, the
provincial capital, <PERSON>Nyambir</PERSON> said.
   He said the provincial government has been unable to promote the
amnesty campaign because <LOCATION>Nampula</LOCATION>'s radio station isn't powerful
enough to broadcast much beyond the city limits and leaflets
haven't been published because the printing press is broken.
   Nonetheless, 16 rebels seeking amnesty turned up in the town of
<LOCATION>Moma</LOCATION> on <DATE>April 9</DATE>, but local authorities had no idea what to do with
them, <PERSON>Nyambir</PERSON> said. It took a week before someone could reach
<LOCATION>Nampula</LOCATION> and receive instructions on how to handle the surrendered
men.
   The war has made <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> one of the poorest countries in the
world and is the primary cause of a famine in which an almost 6
million of the country's 14.5 million people need food assistance.
   There are more than a million refugees inside the country and
700,000 Mozambicans have fled to neighboring states, including
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   The rebel movement, created in <DATE>1977</DATE> by what was then white-ruled
<LOCATION>Rhodesia</LOCATION>, opposes the Marxist policies of the <ORGANIZATION>FRELIMO</ORGANIZATION> party
government, but beyond that its aims are vague.
   No government acknowledges supporting the rebels and they appear
to have generated little support among the civilian population with
their repeated raids on villages in which they often kidnap
residents and force them to carry supplies and grow food at rebel
bases.
   ``Nowhere have I found support (for the guerrillas),'' said <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
Ambassador <PERSON>Melissa Wells</PERSON>. ``I've only found fear and terror.''
   Those who have been kidnapped say the guerrillas make little
effort to explain their positions.
   ``They showed me a picture of their leader and told me that when
they come to power everyone will have a car,'' said <PERSON>Luciano Alouta</PERSON>,
31, who was kidnapped by the rebels in <DATE>July</DATE> and escaped a month
later. ``I did not believe what they told me or understand what
they were fighting for.''
   The rebels threatened to kill anyone who left their camp and
made no attempt to become friendly with the captured civilians,
<PERSON>Alouta</PERSON> said.
   Refugees at several different camps in <LOCATION>Nampula</LOCATION> told similar
stories. In the town of Ribaue, some residents said they sleep in
the surrounding woods to avoid being kidnapped in one of the rebels
frequent nighttime attacks. The hospital and the local
administration building were destroyed, but a cotton gin manages to
keep going, despite four guerrilla raids in the past year.
   The nearby village of Lalaua sits empty following a rebel attack
in early <DATE>April</DATE> in which 50 huts, about a quarter of the village,
were burned. The rebels did not occupy the village, but residents
are afraid to return, saying they fear a repeat attack.

   Police today hunted the killers of a
Mozambican rebel leader, and the rebels accused <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s
Marxist government of assassinating him.
   <PERSON>Evo Fernandes</PERSON>, an influential figure in the <ORGANIZATION>Mozambican National
Resistance</ORGANIZATION>, was shot five times before his body was dumped outside
<LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION>, police said.
   The body was found <DATE>Thursday</DATE> on a country road about 20 miles
west of <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION> after he met with suspected agents of the Mozambican
government, his wife said.
   <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Judiciary Police</ORGANIZATION> said in a statement today that
<PERSON>Fernandes</PERSON> had been shot once above the left eye, three times around
the heart and once in the stomach.
   The statement said police were investigating several clues they
expected to shed light on the crime.
   In a statement issued in <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION> today, the rebels blamed the
Mozambican government for ``the barbarous crime.'' The government
of the southern African nation denied the allegation.
   The rebels, also known by the Portuguese acronym <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION>, have
been fighting a guerrilla war since <DATE>1977</DATE> to topple <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s
government. Guerrilla representatives operate in <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>, the
colonial ruler of <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> until <DATE>1975</DATE>.
   Hundreds of police had been searching for <PERSON>Fernandes</PERSON> since
<DATE>Monday</DATE>, when his wife, <PERSON>Yvette</PERSON>, said he disappeared after meeting
two men who said the Mozambican government had empowered them to
initiate peace talks with the rebels.
   Fernandes, a founder and former secretary-general of <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION>,
believed the two men he dined with <DATE>Sunday</DATE> were authorized to
approach him to set up negotiations with Mozambican officials, his
wife said.
   When her husband failed to return, <PERSON>Mrs. Fernandes</PERSON> said <DATE>Monday</DATE>
she believed he had been abducted by Mozambican security agents.
   Mozambican Foreign Minister <PERSON>Pascoal Mocumbi</PERSON> said <DATE>today</DATE> his
government had no connection with the killing.
   <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> ``does not commit acts of terrorism,'' he told the
official news agency AIM. He suggested that <PERSON>Fernandes</PERSON> was killed as
a result of ``splits and conflicts'' within <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION>.
   Portuguese Foreign Minister <PERSON>Joao de Deus Pinheiro</PERSON> condemned the
assassination.
   <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION> have criticized <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> for allowing
rebel spokesmen to operate in <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION>. The <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION> government says it
will act to prevent subversive actions by the rebels but cannot
interfere with the free speech of their spokesmen.
   Fernandes' body was found in undergrowth beside a road about six
miles north of the resort town of <LOCATION>Cascais</LOCATION>, where he lived. Cascais
is about 20 miles west of <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION>.
   Fernandes, 44, a Portuguese citizen born in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, was
secretary-general of <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION> from <DATE>1983</DATE> to <DATE>1986</DATE>. He was later demoted
to head of the guerrillas' research department, but he remained an
influential figure within the group.
   <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON>Manuel Frank</PERSON> said <DATE>today</DATE> that <PERSON>Fernandes</PERSON>
had gone to <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> in <DATE>January</DATE> and met rebel chief <PERSON>Afonso
Dhlakama</PERSON>. Dhlakama condemned the killing and praised <PERSON>Fernandes</PERSON> as a
``fighter for freedom'' in a statement distributed in <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION>.
   Fernandes' predecessor as <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION> secretary-general, <LOCATION>Orlando
Cristina</LOCATION>, was shot to death in his bed in <DATE>April 1983</DATE> in <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. Some reports blamed the murder on a rebel power
struggle, but <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION> blamed Mozambican security agents.
   Fernandes was married twice and had six children.

   Rebels seized dozens of villagers in
<LOCATION>Gaza Province</LOCATION> and then massacred 54 of them with axes, clubs and
machetes near the southern coastal town of <LOCATION>Xai-Xai</LOCATION>, the official
news agency AIM said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   AIM said 13 women and eight children were among those
slaughtered on <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> by guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique
National Resistance</ORGANIZATION> and that 17 people were wounded, 15 of them
seriously.
   The agency, citing a report in <LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION>'s Noticias newspaper, said
most of the victims were kidnapped and forcibly marched to the
<PERSON>Fidel Castro</PERSON> village, just outside <LOCATION>Xai-Xai</LOCATION> and about 90 miles
northeast of <LOCATION>Maputo</LOCATION>, the capital.
   <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s civil war has gone on for 12 years. It has resulted
in an estimated 600,000 deaths, created more than a million
refugees and left nearly half of the nation's 14.7 million people
dependent on food aid.
   No government acknowledges supporting the insurrectionists.
   The attack came while rebel leaders and government
representatives were in <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> trying to resolve the war. Mozambican
churchmen, acting on behalf of the government, met the rebels
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, but no major breakthroughs were reported.
   The guerrillas have been accused of widespread civilian
atrocities in their battle to undermine <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s socialist
government.
   <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> openly supported the rebels until <DATE>1984</DATE>, but says it
since has abided by a mutual non-aggression pact with neighboring
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>.
   President <PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON> said recently he accepted South
African statements that it no longer aids the rebels. <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>
still believes the rebels receive help from non-governmental groups
in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, however.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Renamo drops Mozambique election boycott
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER STANLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s first multi-party elections were back on course <TIME>last night</TIME>
after <PERSON>Mr Afonso Dhlakama</PERSON>, leader of the country's former rebel movement,
reversed his eve of poll decision to stage a boycott.
The <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> leader changed his mind under intense pressure from the <ORGANIZATION>United
Nations</ORGANIZATION>, western countries that have helped fund the elections, and from
neighbouring states, including <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
It would have been made clear to him that he could expect no sympathy from
either regional or international governments, and <PERSON>Mr Dhlakama</PERSON> may well have
been warned that the frontline group of southern African states were
prepared to offer military assistance to the newly elected government of
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> should <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> resume its guerrilla war.
'The fact that <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> had committed troops (to <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>) in the past was
a strong incentive to <PERSON>Dhlakama</PERSON> to sit up and take notice,' said <PERSON>Mr Greg
Mills</PERSON>, director of studies at the <ORGANIZATION>South African Institute for International
Affairs</ORGANIZATION>.
He said the sending by <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> of Deputy President <PERSON>Thabo Mbkei</PERSON> and
Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON>Aziz Pahad</PERSON>, with the blessing of other regional
states, to pressure <PERSON>Mr Dhlakama</PERSON> had shown the <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> leader the depth of
anger at the boycott, which had threatened to unhinge years of work to
restore peace in the impoverished country.
The boycott decision, said <PERSON>Mr Mills</PERSON>, announced only hours before polling
began on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, highlighted a deep split within <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>, which fought a
16-year war against <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s formerly Marxist rulers of President
<PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Frelimo</ORGANIZATION> party.
'There is a very big split within the (<ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION>) party, with <PERSON>Dhlakama</PERSON> and his
advisers on the one side and a large number of party officials who realised
<ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> had very little option,' said <PERSON>Mr Mills</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mr Dhlakama</PERSON> changed his mind after negotiating through the <TIME>night</TIME> and morning
with officials from the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION>, western embassies and the <ORGANIZATION>National
Election Commission</ORGANIZATION>. He declined to answer questions about his volte face.
The <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION> extended the country's two-day presidential and parliamentary
elections and voting will continue today. Mozambicans and African leaders
had feared the <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> boycott could lead to a renewal of the civil war which
ended with a peace accord between <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Frelimo</ORGANIZATION> two years ago.
'A shadow has been lifted with <PERSON>Dhlakama</PERSON>'s decision,' the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION>
special envoy to <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr Aldo Ajello</PERSON>, said.
<PERSON>Mr Ajello</PERSON>, in charge of the 7,000 strong UN peacekeeping force, said his
impression was that the election had gone well so far.
President <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON>, widely expected to be returned to the presidency and
capture a majorty of the 250 parliamentary seats at stake, welcomed the
decision: 'This is what all of us wanted,' he said.
There remain doubts, however, about the <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> leader's intentions, and many
observers do not rule out the possibility that <PERSON>Mr Dhlakama</PERSON> will cry foul
when the reults are declared.
Final results are not expected until mid-November. Mr There are 12
presidential contenders and 14 political groups vying for a place in the
assembly.

<TEXT>
   Last year, southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> was
ablaze with wars in <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> that all seemed
to defy a solution. Today, <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> is on the road to independence,
<LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION> has a cease-fire, and there are moves afoot to begin peace
talks in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>.
   Each conflict has been fueled by separate forces, but a common
ingredient for the improved regional climate has been <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s
campaign to mend relations with its long-hostile neighbors in black
<LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>.
   Since <DATE>August</DATE>, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> has:
   _Withdrawn its troops from <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>, where they fought
intermittently since <DATE>1975</DATE> alongside the rebels of the <ORGANIZATION>National Union</ORGANIZATION>
for the Total Independence of <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>UNITA</ORGANIZATION>. The rebels and the
Marxist Angolan government reached a cease-fire agreement last week
that took effect <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   _Begun implementing a U.N.-supervised independence plan in
<LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>, the territory <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> has ruled for 74 years.
   _Held a series of top-level meetings with <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> and offered
financial assistance to help repair the country's war-devastated
economy.
   Black-ruled nations remain skeptical of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, saying the
country's policy of apartheid at home and its destabilization
campaign abroad caused the regional turmoil.
   But there has been a sharp reversal in the political tides since
the middle of <DATE>1988</DATE>, when conflicts dating to the <DATE>1960s</DATE> and <DATE>1970s</DATE>
appeared ready to escalate again.
   ``Those who were part of the problem yesterday are now part of
the solution,'' Mozambican President <PERSON>Joaquim Chissano</PERSON> said <DATE>Friday</DATE>
<TIME>night</TIME> after returning from an African summit in <LOCATION>Zaire</LOCATION>, where the
Angolan cease-fire was announced.
   ``To make myself clear, I don't think the <LOCATION>South Africans</LOCATION> will go
back on their word'' in <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> was quoted as
saying by the national news agency AIM.
   In <DATE>May 1988</DATE>, the heaviest fighting in the Angolan war was
reported around the southeastern city of Cuito Cuanavale. Angolan
government troops, backed by Cuban soldiers, fought the combined
UNITA-South African forces to an apparent standoff.
   The Cuban troop strength in <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION> had surpassed 50,000 and <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION> acknowledged 3,000 soldiers more-or-less based in <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>.
   Faced with an expensive, open-ended conflict and mounting white
casualties, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> apparently decided to leave <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>. Peace
talks between <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> _ but not <ORGANIZATION>UNITA</ORGANIZATION> _ began
in late <DATE>May 1988</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> completed its withdrawal from <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION> in <DATE>August</DATE>. In
<DATE>December</DATE>, the three countries signed a regional peace accord that
called for <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> to halt aid to <ORGANIZATION>UNITA</ORGANIZATION> and to grant
independence to <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>. In return, <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> has agreed to a phased
troop withdrawal.
   <ORGANIZATION>UNITA</ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, continued to fight for a power-sharing
agreement until the cease-fire was announced. <LOCATION>Zambia</LOCATION>'s President
<PERSON>Kenneth Kaunda</PERSON> called the agreement ``a great moment for <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>.''
   The rival Angolan parties still face difficult negotiations, but
a commission elected at the summit plans to oversee the integration
of <ORGANIZATION>UNITA</ORGANIZATION> into the current one-party state.
   In <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>, a 23-year bush war waged by the <ORGANIZATION>South-West Africa
People's Organization</ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION>SWAPO</ORGANIZATION>, against South African rule appears
over.
   An estimated 10,000 <ORGANIZATION>SWAPO</ORGANIZATION> supporters celebrated the accord on
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> with a rally, and <ORGANIZATION>SWAPO</ORGANIZATION> leaders said that ``we must now
wage peace.''
   <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> announced <DATE>Saturday</DATE> it was down to 1,500 troops in
<LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>, a week ahead of the <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> deadline under the territory's
independence plan. <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> had an estimated 50,000 soliders in
<LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> before the independence plan took effect <DATE>April 1</DATE>.
   The independence plan almost fell apart the day it began when
more than 1,000 <ORGANIZATION>SWAPO</ORGANIZATION> guerrillas crossed into northern <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> in
violation of the regional peace agreement.
   More than 300 guerrillas and 27 security-force members were
killed, but the fighting has stopped and pre-independence elections
are planned for <DATE>November</DATE>. Independence is expected to come early
next year.
   <LOCATION>Zambia</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Kaunda</PERSON>, one of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s harshest critics in the
past, said black African states would consider strengthening ties
with <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> if Namibian independence goes smoothly.
   With tangible successes in <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>, southern African
leaders have turned their sights toward the region's most active
conflict, <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, where the Marxist government has fought the
rebel <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique National Resistance</ORGANIZATION> since <DATE>1977</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>'s President <PERSON>Robert Mugabe</PERSON>, whose troops support
Mozambican government forces, said the plan to end the Angolan war
could have parallels for <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>.
   Although the two wars differ in some ways, ``the (Angolan peace
talk) principles deserve the attention of the Mozambicans,'' he was
quoted as saying <DATE>Friday</DATE> by <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>ZIANA</ORGANIZATION> news agency. ``I am sure
something will unfold soon.''
   <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> said he hoped the Angolan agreement would
encourage the rebels to take up an amnesty offer in effect since
<DATE>January 1988</DATE>.
   More than 3,000 rebels, out of a force estimated at 12,000 to
22,000, already have accepted the offer, according to government
figures.
   On <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, <PERSON>Chissano</PERSON> said President <PERSON>Mobutu Sese Seko</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Zaire</LOCATION>
had agreed to act as a mediator between the government and the
guerrillas, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
   Chissano has refused to negotiate with the rebels, but his
government has quietly encouraged unpublicized talks between local
church leaders and the rebels, according to sources in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>.

   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> would be willing to consider
a mediation role to help end <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s civil war but is seeking
clarifications regarding <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s proposed peace plan, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
officials said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   The comments by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials responded to a call <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by
South African Foreign Minister <PERSON>Pik Botha</PERSON> for the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to
mediate an end to the 12-year civil war in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>.
   ``We welcome <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s expression of interest in ending the
tragic conflict in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> that has brought endless suffering and
death to hundreds of thousands of Mozambiquan citizens,'' said <ORGANIZATION>State
Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Charles Redman</PERSON>.
   ``We encourage the government and people of <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> to achieve
a durable peace in their country. If that government were to ask us
to play a role in this regard, we would be prepared to give
thoughtful consideration to exactly how we could be of assistance,
either as mediator or otherwise,'' <PERSON>Redman</PERSON> said.
   But the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is uncertain whether <PERSON>Botha</PERSON>'s proposal
includes the rebel <ORGANIZATION>Mozambique National Resistance</ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION>,
said another official.
   ``We are seeking clarification on that,'' said <PERSON>E. Gibson Lanpher</PERSON>,
the department's top official for southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Lanpher</PERSON> also said
``it's an open question whether the South African government has
made that decision'' of stopping aid to <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> helped <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION> in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE> but says it stopped
such aid in <DATE>1984</DATE> under terms of an agreement with the government.
However, the <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> government continues to accuse <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>
of aiding <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``It is clear that <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s longstanding relations with
<ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION> give it the ability to play a constructive role in ending the
conflict if it's prepared to do so,'' <PERSON>Redman</PERSON> said.
   In testimony <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to the <ORGANIZATION>House Appropriations Committee</ORGANIZATION>'s
subcommittee on foreign operations, a refugee organization that
operates in the region said it was skeptical of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s
claims that its support for <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION> had ceased.
   <PERSON>William Frelick</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Committee for Refugees</ORGANIZATION>, a private
group, said <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION> ``is the Khmer Rouge of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> is
its killing field.''
   RENAMO engages in ``systematic visciousness that puts it in a
class by itself,'' including mutilations of babies, forced labor of
the elderly, looting, torture and the killing of more than 100,000
people, he said.
   A <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> human rights report issued this week agrees
with this assessment, but disagrees with human rights groups'
suggestions that the <ORGANIZATION>RENAMO</ORGANIZATION> brutality has increased.
